Questions for Oct. 7 Meeting 
- what is the downstream inputs/outputs
- what are the preferred labels (are they static)
  - which / how many
  - how general
- what is the purpose of the line chart for topics if they are static
- where is the model being deployed / what are the limitations on compute time

Notes beyond:
