And there are clear pictures emerging of who potential Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis voters are, as a majority of potential Republican voters continue to say they would be better off with someone other than Trump at the top of the ticket.DeSantis, at this point, is at least a co-front-runner for the nomination. His support skews more toward Republicans with college degrees, who make more money and live in cities and suburbs, as opposed to Trump's more blue-collar, rural appeal. Their distinct lanes could make for a protracted GOP primary, if DeSantis ultimately decides to get into the race.Biden is widely expected to seek reelection despite his age. At 80, he is the oldest person to serve as president. As inflation stretches Americans' wallets and after the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, he has struggled with middling approval ratings.He bottomed out at 36% in July of last year, as independents soured on him, and Democrats were unenthusiastic about his presidency. But Biden has made steady improvement since then, and this month, he is up to 46% approval with all respondents and an even higher 49% with registered voters.That's good news for the president. The 46% is his highest mark since March of last year, and he hasn't been at 49% since the Afghanistan withdrawal in August of 2021. He's benefitting in the survey from a rebound with Democrats, and in this hyper-partisan atmosphere, a president needs his base shored up.One warning sign, however, is that Biden still is lagging with independents – just 36% of them approve of the job he's doing.Improved confidence in Biden for 2024For months, Democrats have not been sure that Biden was their best shot at winning in 2024.Lots of surveys, including Marist's, have shown that members of Biden's own party think he's too old and they'd have a better chance of winning the White House with someone else – although there's been little agreement on who that should be.Back in November – right before the midterms – 54% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they had a better chance with someone else.That's changed in this survey. Now, 50% say they have the best chance with Biden, while 45% think the best chance lies with a different candidate.The biggest shifts are coming from whites without college degrees, those who make less than $50,000 a year, voters under 45 and women who live in small cities or the suburbs. All are key target demographic groups, who helped Biden win in 2020. They're the kinds of voters he peeled away from Trump, who made inroads with these groups in 2016.Why is this happening?Let's start with the fact that these are Democrats and independents who lean Democratic, so they're at least open to Biden's message. But three potential reasons:Democrats had better than expected midterm elections;Biden's State of the Union address had to give at least some of these potential Democratic voters more confidence in his ability to carry the message forward, and;This is likely also part of the normal coalescing around a nominee, as it becomes more and more apparent that Biden will run for reelection.What about other Democrats?Biden's favorability rating with Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents stands at 83% favorable, 13% unfavorable, or +70.That's significantly better than Vice President Kamala Harris, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg or Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who the poll also tested.Buttigieg: 63%/12% (+51) with 25% unsure. This represents a net 10-point improvement for Buttigieg since September 2019 during his run for president when 36% were unsure. He also gets a 48%/19% score with Democratic-leaning independents, showing he's far-less disliked with the group than Vice President Harris. (Biden gets a 71%/25% rating with them.)Harris: 63%/21% (+42) with 16% unsure. That's not much different than where she was in September 2019 (56%/17%). While she has a marginally higher positive score with Democrats than Buttigieg (69% vs. 66%), Democratic-leaning independents give her just a 43%/39% score.Whitmer: 42%/19% (+23) with 49% unsure. A significant portion of the national audience is unfamiliar with her.The mirror images of Trump and DeSantisThings don't look quite as good for Trump, as he faces what's shaping up to be a serious threat to his quest to be the GOP nominee again next year.By a 54%-to-42% margin, Republicans and independents who lean their direction said they think they would have a better chance in 2024 with someone other than Trump. That's actually a slight improvement for Trump, considering 35% in November said Trump would give them the best chance at winning.Still, the percentage saying they would be better off with someone else hasn't budged. And there are clear cleavages – voters with college degrees, ones who make more than $50,000 a year and parents with children under 18 are far more likely to say they'd be better off with someone else, by 20 points or more in some cases.That means a majority of Republicans are looking around for someone else, and the very people who think they have less of a chance with Trump seem to have DeSantis in the sights.Look at how their favorability ratings among Republicans and Republican leaners divide:Trump: 68% favorable, 25% unfavorable (+43) with just 7% unsure. He does best with white evangelical Christians, whites without degrees, those who live in small towns or rural areas and lower-income voters. DeSantis: 66%/11% (+55) with almost a quarter unsure (23%). So DeSantis has some convincing to do and depending on how he makes the sale, if he runs, he may have some room to grow. He is best liked by college grads, those who make more than $50,000 a year, people who live in big cities or the suburbs, and Republican-leaning independents. DeSantis is significantly better liked with those Republican leaners with a 63%/11% favorability rating (+52) as compared to Trump's 57%/33% (+24).Haley: 41%/12% (+23) with almost half (46%) unsure. The former South Carolina governor and ambassador to the United Nations under Trump got into the race officially last week, but still has a lot to prove to these voters.Pence: 51%/30% (+21) with 19% unsure. Pence's base is supposed to be with white evangelical Christians. It's a major reason for why Trump put him on the ticket in 2016. But Pence is far less liked by the group than either Trump or DeSantis.The live caller telephone survey, using cell phones and landlines, of more than 1,300 adults and about 1,200 registered was conducted last week by the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, well after the president's State of the Union address. Where all adults are referred to, the survey has a margin of error of +/- 3.3 percentage points, meaning results could be about 3 points lower or higher. Where registered voters are referenced, it has a similar +/- 3.5 percentage point margin of error.There were 570 Democrats and independents who lean Democratic. Where they're referenced, it's a +/- 5.1 percentage point margin. There were 460 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents interviewed. The margin for this subgroup is +/- 5.7 percentage points.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who is the new chairman of the Senate\'s top health committee. He spoke in his committee\'s first hearing last week."We are going to produce legislation, and I think people will be surprised about the level of bipartisan supporters," Sanders said in a brief interview during a break from the hearing. He called for the committee to "produce something meaningful."The shortage of health care workers of all sorts is a widespread problem, but is especially acute in rural areas and minority communities. Sanders pointed to the startling numbers of Americans living in medical care deserts to illustrate the point. There are nearly 100 million people who don\'t have easy access to a primary care physician, almost 70 million with no dentist at hand, and some 158 million people who have few local mental health providers, Sanders said.The COVID pandemic contributed to the nation\'s existing worker shortage as many left the workforce as the crisis worsened. Some contracted the virus themselves, and large numbers of health care providers died. An investigation by KHN and The Guardian revealed more than 3,600 health workers in the United States died during the pandemic\'s first year alone. Many others got burnt out or sought higher-paying jobs elsewhere."Despite all of our health care spending, we don\'t have enough doctors, nurses, nurse practitioners, dentists, dental hygienists, pharmacists, mental health providers, and other medical professionals," Sanders said, pointing to data that suggest the nation faces a shortfall of about 450,000 nurses and 120,000 doctors in the coming years, and 100,000 dentists now.While Democrats and Republicans alike acknowledged the shortages hobbling care for hundreds of millions of Americans, any legislative solution must pass not only the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, but also the full Senate and House of Representatives. Far-right House Republicans have threatened to go so far as forcing the federal government to default on its debts as they demand spending cuts, and high government spending on health care could make new legislation a ripe target.Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the committee\'s top Republican who is also a doctor, cited a few programs the committee is responsible for updating this year, such as an expiring program that trains many of the nation\'s pediatricians. He said funding should reflect what works in the health care system and come "with the appropriate spending offsets.""We have to make sure that we\'re not wasting the money we\'re trying to productively spend," he said.None of the senators in the hearing disagreed with the fundamental problem that too many medical professionals are leaving their fields and that educational institutions are not graduating enough new ones to replace them and meet the growing needs of an aging population.Members on both sides of the aisle recognized growing levels of burnout in the medical professions; increased threats faced by health care workers; the costs and challenges of working underserved areas; and financial incentives that steer younger professionals toward more lucrative specialties and higher-income areas.Senators agreed on some strategies to boost numbers of health workers, such as encouraging more lower-cost educational options like community college and ensuring that existing programs are extended this year, such as the National Health Service Corps that trains doctors for underserved areas and graduate education programs.A whiff of partisan thinking drifted into the conversation, with some Republicans focused more on decrying government interference in health care. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, suggested the State Department should do a better job clearing foreign students and practitioners to immigrate here. Cassidy raised electronic health records requirements as a contributor to physician burnout, saying they consume too much time. Even in those areas, there were signs lawmakers could agree. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., also raised the idea of unjamming the immigrant backlog.Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said vaccine requirements were an impediment. Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., raised regulations barring some surprise medical bills as harmful to doctors."I think the fact that the committee has made this the first hearing means a number of us have bills. We may try to take a bunch of them up together and see if we can combine them into something," said Kaine, pointing in particular to the idea of expanding loan forgiveness for people willing to go into areas with shortages. "I think there\'s great prospects for bipartisan progress on this."Some of the senators credited Sanders with the initial progress toward a compromise. He spent his first weeks in his post meeting with committee members from both parties to identify areas of bipartisan agreement.Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said Sanders reached out to meet with her and discuss her priorities. They both named workforce shortages as a top issue, she said, adding, "We\'ve got good stuff to work on.""In my conversation with him just on the floor this week, about what we might be able to do with the workforce issue, I think he was kind of probing to see if we could put together some efforts to just focus on these workforce shortages," Murkowski told KHN. "There is a great deal of interest in legislating in this space.""What it\'s going to look like, I can\'t tell you yet," she added. "We are going to produce legislation," Sanders said as the hearing ended. "I don\'t do hearings for the sake of hearings."KHN (Kaiser Health News) is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues.

Aside from the paltry number of trials in the federal system, states including Pennsylvania, Texas and New York have trial rates of less than three percent. In Santa Cruz County, Ariz., there were no trials from 2010 to 2012, the report said.The prevalence of plea bargaining exploded in the last several decades as a way to save money and time and to promote more certainty in outcomes. But the practice comes with "a very high cost," said Lucian Dervan, a professor at Belmont University College of Law in Nashville. Pleas can allow police and government misconduct to go unchecked, because mistakes and misbehavior often only emerge after defense attorneys gain access to witness interviews and other materials, with which they can test the strength of a government case before trial.The deals also exacerbate racial inequality, with Black defendants more often subject to prosecutors\' stacking of multiple charges in drug and gun cases. Altogether, defendants face stiffer punishments for going to trial — known as a trial penalty — that can add seven to nine years or more to their sentence.But most stark in the report is research that cites innocent defendants who agree to falsely plead guilty, sometimes on the advice of their own lawyers. An Innocence Project database of exonerations includes dozens of people who falsely pleaded guilty."This isn\'t just having an effect on those individuals," said Dervan, who co-chaired the task force. "It\'s having an effect on the entire community and the safety of the entire community."Overhauling the justice system will be no easy task — since it could require changes to laws and ethics rules in many U.S. states. "It\'s past time to start that work," said Dervan, who recently created the Plea Bargaining Institute to generate and share research.The ABA task force makes 14 recommendations, including the need to collect and analyze data on plea bargains; the need to give defendants access to discovery materials before they enter a plea; and the need to eliminate bail requirements or pretrial detention when they\'re used to coerce someone into pleading guilty.The report also presses prosecutors and judges not to demand or accept plea deals where defendants waive essential legal rights, such as the right to appeal and receive exculpatory information; and the right to make future claims for release for reasons of terminal illness.

Not only has the war in Ukraine set off a geopolitical realignment, but it has caused economic hardship far from the epicenter of the fighting.The Feb. 24, 2022, invasion has touched off a refugee crisis, as Ukrainians flee the conflict in their homeland and many Russian men seek to avoid conscription. Meanwhile, it has spurred a process toward expanding NATO, with Finland and Sweden pursuing membership after decades of official neutrality.Ukraine and Russia are key exporters of wheat, barley, corn and cooking oil, particularly to African and Middle Eastern countries. Turkey and the United Nations brokered a deal last summer to allow Ukrainian grain to pass through Black Sea ports, but Russia is reportedly still hindering shipments. Russia is also a major producer of fertilizer and petroleum. Disruptions to the flow of these goods are compounding other supply chain and climate challenges, driving up food and gas prices and causing shortages in places such as Chad, Tunisia and Sri Lanka.More than 8 million refugees have fled Ukraine in what the World Health Organization describes as "the largest movement of people in the European Region since the Second World War." Many have been involuntarily relocated by Russia. Others have put a strain on resources, as well as schools and hospitals, in Poland and Germany.A 21st century war in Europe — led by a nuclear power — is pushing the world toward realignment. It has rattled NATO, the European Union and the U.N., forcing countries to take sides in ways that have led to escalating tensions and diplomatic shifts. For example, Turkey, despite being a NATO member, has increased trade with Russia since the start of the war and has thrown up objections to allowing Sweden and Finland into the alliance.Russia is one of the world\'s largest producers of oil and fuel. European countries have banned the Russian oil, gas and diesel they relied on, which initially caused a steep spike in prices. However, moves by European nations to lock in alternative sources, along with conservation efforts and a mild winter, have largely alleviated those price hikes. Now prices have returned to pre-invasion levels.Russia has more nuclear weapons than any other country. Its attack on Ukraine has notably reenergized NATO, with the U.S. and other member states funneling tens of billions of dollars worth of military equipment into Ukraine. Early weapons deliveries included anti-tank rockets such as the U.S.-made Javelin. In the latest moves, the U.S., Germany and Britain have promised to provide state-of-the-art tanks.NPR\'s Will Chase, Alex Leff, Pam Webster, Desiree Hicks and Nishant Dahiya contributed to this report.

But the movement has been getting pushback from some Hindu Americans who argue that such legislation maligns a specific community.Tensions within the community were visible at Seattle City Hall on Tuesday as a noisy hearing culminated with a 6-1 vote with a majority of the council agreeing that caste discrimination crosses national and religious boundaries and that without such laws, those facing caste discrimination in the U.S. will have no protections.The packed room, which overflowed with activists from both sides bearing banners, chanting slogans, challenging speakers and city officials as they made their comments, laid bare stark divisions over this issue within the South Asian diaspora. A majority of those present in council chambers were supporters of the ordinance and those opposed were a vocal minority.As council members voted in favor of the ordinance, the chamber erupted into cheers of "Jai Bhim," which means "victory for Bhim" a rallying cry adopted by followers of B.R. Ambedkar, an Indian Dalit rights icon whose given name was Bhimrao. Dalit groups and their supporters say caste discrimination is prevalent in U.S. diaspora communities, manifesting itself in the form of social alienation and discrimination in housing, education and the tech sector where South Asians hold key roles.Yogesh Mane, a Seattle resident who grew up as an untouchable in India, broke into tears as he heard the council\'s decision."I\'m emotional because this is the first time such an ordinance has been passed anywhere in the world outside of South Asia," he said. "It\'s a historic moment."Thenmozhi Soundararajan, executive director of Oakland, California-based Equality Labs, whose advocacy work along with community partners continues to push caste discrimination laws forward, called the council vote "a culture war that has been won.""We got the support of over 200 organizations from Seattle and around the country," she said. "It\'s a powerful message that Dalit people are not alone. The South Asian community has united to say we want to heal from the trauma of caste."Council Member Kshama Sawant, a socialist and the only Indian American on the City Council, said the ordinance, which she proposed, does not single out one community, but it accounts for how caste discrimination crosses national and religious boundaries. Sawant said the council received over 4,000 emails in support of the ordinance."We\'ve heard hundreds of gut-wrenching stories over the last few weeks showing us that caste discrimination is very real in Seattle," she said.Council Member Sara Nelson who cast the lone dissenting vote agreed with opponents calling the ordinance "a reckless, harmful solution to a problem for which we have no data or research.""This could generate more anti-Hindu discrimination and could dissuade employers from hiring South Asians," she said. "The community that is being impacted is deeply divided on this issue."Nelson also said the ordinance would also get the city entangled in legal battles to which Sawant responded: "Bring it on." Sawant said being fearful of lawsuits is not the way to effect progress or change.Council Member Lisa Herbold questioned opponents\' logic that the law singles out Hindus and people of Indian descent."That\'s like saying gender discrimination laws single out all men," she said. "And just because we have a small population that is experiencing (caste discrimination) that doesn\'t make it any less important."Shobha Swamy, a representative of the Coalition of Hindus of North America said she was disappointed by the council deliberations and line of questioning. The group said they received a show of support from over 100 organizations."Due diligence wasn\'t done," said Swami, who flew in from Atlanta.C.H. Srikrishna, a San Francisco Bay Area-based tech worker, said he is worried about the ramifications this ordinance might have for the South Asian community."I too want discrimination to end," he said. "But we need to first determine that widespread discrimination exists."Srikrishna, who is Hindu, believes the ordinance does target his religion."When you say it originated 2,000 years ago, that is implicitly blaming Hinduism," he said. "That bothers me. I feel betrayed."Sanjay Patel, a tech company owner from the Seattle area, said he never felt discriminated against in the U.S. as a member of a lower caste and that the ordinance pained him because it reminded him of a caste identity, which he thought had become obsolete."I fear with this law, businesses will be afraid to hire South Asians," he said.Earlier Tuesday morning, several activists braved cold temperatures and wind gusts to line up outside City Hall so they would get a chance to speak to the council before the vote. But the council restricted public comment at the meeting where more than 300 people had requested to speak virtually and in person. They heard about half of the comments before moving on to deliberations and the vote.The origins of the caste system in India can be traced back 3,000 years as a social hierarchy based on one\'s occupation and birth. It is a system that has evolved over the centuries under Muslim and British rule. The suffering of those who are at the bottom of the caste pyramid — known as Dalits — has continued. Caste discrimination has been prohibited in India since 1948, a year after the nation\'s independence from British rule.The U.S. is the second most popular destination for Indians living abroad, according to the Migration Policy Institute, which estimates the U.S. diaspora grew from about 206,000 in 1980 to about 2.7 million in 2021. The group South Asian Americans Leading Together reports that nearly 5.4 million South Asians live in the U.S. — up from the 3.5 million counted in the 2010 census. Most trace their roots to Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.Over the past three years, several colleges and university systems have moved to prohibit caste discrimination.In December 2019, Brandeis University near Boston became the first U.S. college to include caste in its nondiscrimination policy. The California State University System, Colby College, Brown University and the University of California, Davis have all adopted similar measures. Harvard University instituted caste protections for student workers in 2021 as part of its contract with its graduate student union.

After he returned he told his wife of two weeks not to say that he had been out.Since the investigation was renewed in 2019, detectives re-interviewed DeRoos\' former wife, and she told them he had left their apartment for a brief period within a window of time when Curran\'s roommates were out of her Burlington apartment."We\'re all confident that William DeRoos is responsible for the aggravated murder of Rita Curran, but because he died in a hotel room of a drug overdose he will not be held accountable for his actions, but this case will be closed," Burlington Police Detective Lt. James Trieb, the commander of the Detective Services Bureau, said during a Tuesday morning news conference.After Curran\'s death DeRoos, who was known to some as a guru, moved to Thailand and became a monk, but he later returned to the United States. In 1986 DeRoos died of a drug overdose in San Francisco, police said.Curran\'s parents died without learning who had killed their daughter, but the victim\'s brother and sister attended the event held at Burlington police headquarters."I don\'t think so much about the guy who did this as I do about Rita, my parents and what they went through," Curran\'s brother Tom said during the event. "I pray to Rita and I pray to my parents."In the early morning hours of July 20, 1971 Burlington police were called to the Brooks Avenue apartment after Curran\'s roommate arrived home to find her body in their shared bedroom.Police say Curran resisted fiercely, but she was strangled. The murder shook Burlington.The case remained open and investigators never let it go, but in 2019, Trieb and a team of detectives, officers, technicians and others began working the case as though it had just happened.A key piece of evidence was a cigarette butt that had been found near Curran\'s body. In 2014, previous investigators had sent the butt and other evidence off for DNA analysis. The test did compile a DNA profile of whoever had smoked the cigarette, but it did not match any samples in DNA databases compiled by law enforcement.The detectives who picked up the case in 2019 contracted with a DNA testing company and the samples were compared with genetic material submitted to commercial DNA testing companies by members of the public. Last August, Burlington detectives were told the sample, which had been traced through relatives on both sides of DeRoos\'s family, was pointing at DeRoos, even though he had no DNA profile on record.Detectives then determined DeRoos and his wife Michelle had been living upstairs at the time of Curran\'s death. They had spoken with investigators after Curran\'s death, but at the time they said they had not seen or heard anything.DeRoos and his wife, who no longer uses the name DeRoos, left Vermont shortly after Curran\'s death. Their marriage ended after DeRoos went to Thailand. DeRoos married again after moving back to the United States.In a recent interview, DeRoos\'s ex-wife, who lived with him in Burlington and now lives in Eugene, Oregon, told investigators she had lied about her husband leaving their apartment that night. Burlington detectives later interviewed a subsequent wife who told them DeRoos had a penchant for sudden outbursts of violence.Detective Thomas Chennette, who interviewed DeRoos\'s first ex-wife, said Tuesday he didn\'t believe she knew he had killed Curran, but was protecting him because he had a criminal record."I think she lied at the time because she was young. She was naive. She was newly married. She was in love," Chennette said.Now-retired U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, who was the Chittenden County State\'s Attorney when Curran was killed and went to the crime scene that night, attended the Tuesday event. Asked if he felt the case would ever be solved, he said that he had hoped it would."I must admit after 20 and 30, 40 years I figured it never would. ... It was a terrible thing," he said.

The concept of a perma-long weekend with no reduction in pay. It\'s so attractive in theory that we as a society refuse to let it go.But it\'s starting to feel like that mirage of an oasis in the desert. We\'re desperate for some relief, but it always seems just out of reach...What is it? The four-day workweek. There have been any number of studies in recent years looking into this, but will we see it en masse?For some, it is now here. A pilot program in the U.K. tried it out at dozens of companies. And the results were so good, most of the participating firms say they\'re going to stick with it.The concept is based on the idea that most jobs with a 40-hour week can get the same amount of work done in 32 (or at least four 10-hour days).As work itself evolves at a rapid pace (our colleagues are literal robots these days) the Monday-Friday model is looking pretty outdated to many.The U.K. study found a hefty list of benefits associated with cutting back, too: 46% of employees said they were less fatigued; three out of five said it was easier to balance work-home life. Sounds pretty good, right?What\'s the big deal? Well, the idea appears to be gaining momentum — at least in some circles.A 2022 Ernst & Young study into the "future of work" surveyed more than 500 U.S. C-suite and business leaders across a range of industries, and found 40% have either started using a four-day workweek or are in the process of implementing one.Buuuut it\'s not that simple.A 2021 study out of New Zealand found that after moving to a four-day workweek, work intensified — as did pressure around performance management.And some experts have noted that employees can have a hard time disconnecting and may still try to make themselves available. Then there are questions of equality. Some have noted the idea has a more natural home in tech and white collar work. And the idea of a set 40-hour workweek might even seem like a luxury for those with longer hours, late nights or unpredictable schedules.What are people saying?David Frayne, a research associate at University of Cambridge who worked on the recent U.K. trial, said the signs were positive:"We feel really encouraged by the results, which showed the many ways companies were turning the four-day week from a dream into a realistic policy, with multiple benefits ... We think there is a lot here that ought to motivate other companies and industries to give it a try."Simon Ursell, the managing director of an environment consultancy that took part in the trial, told NPR the company was making the four-day workweek permanent. But he says reimagining the traditional work structure shouldn\'t stop with this one idea:"What I think the trial has proved is that working in a way that is most applicable to your organization to achieve the sweet spot of the best productivity for the time, that\'s what you\'ve gotta be aiming at. It\'s not necessarily just four days. I think the real question for me is what is the best thing for your organization? What are you going to get the best outcomes for?"Lindsay Tjepkema, the CEO of a marketing technology company called Casted, last year told NPR she wasn\'t convinced an extra day off is the relief people crave."Real flexibility is being able to say, \'Hey I want to start my workday late\' or \'I want to cut out early on Wednesdays for kid reasons, for friend reasons, for personal reasons, for pet reasons. So if I mandate that flexibility at our company means you get Fridays off, that\'s not flexibility. That\'s mandating a day off."So, what now? The idea just won\'t go away.In Maryland, a group of lawmakers have just introduced legislation for a four-day workweek. If passed, participating businesses could be eligible for up to $750,000 in aggregate income tax credits.Throwing a little credit to the pandemic disruption here, but the timing on this conversation might finally be right. Forced to let staff work remotely, many managers saw that they could trust employees to manage their own time, meeting deadlines and expectations, adapting quickly to a nontraditional office structure. Also sparing a thought for the planet here: fewer workdays means less cars on the road for commutes and lower utility bills. Anything that gets the carbon footprint down amid the climate chaos of 2023 will work for me.

Constitution spells out who’s in charge when the governor and lieutenant governor travel.', 'content': 'As military members and elected officials gathered at the State House Tuesday to honor Marines who served in the Battle of Iwo Jima, neither Gov. Maura Healey nor Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll was on hand. Instead, sitting quietly to the side (until it was his turn to offer remarks), was the man who steps in when both Healey and Driscoll — and their predecessors for the last three decades — are away: Secretary of State Bill Galvin. Healey and Driscoll are both out of state during the February school vacation week, Healey in Florida until Thursday and Driscoll in Georgia until Sunday. When both leave Massachusetts, an acting governor is in charge. Under the Massachusetts Constitution, when both the governor’s and lieutenant governor’s office are vacant — “by reason of death, absence from the commonwealth, or otherwise” — it’s up to the secretary of state to fulfill duties of both. In this case, that means Galvin, a Brighton Democrat who’s taken on the acting governor role many times since he was first elected secretary in 1994 — so many times, in fact, that a spokesperson said he’s likely lost count. If Healey, Driscoll and Galvin are all out of state (or if one of them leaves office for another reason), the line of succession moves across the other statewide elected officers. In order, it’s: Attorney General Andrea Campbell, Treasurer Deb Goldberg and Auditor Diana DiZoglio. The state constitution stops there, specifying no further acting governors after the auditor. During a vacancy of the two top offices, the constitution gives the acting governor “full power and authority to do and execute all and every such acts, matters and things as the governor or the lieutenant-governor might or could lawfully do or execute, if they, or either of them, were personally present.”Galvin over the years has signed bills while serving as acting governor, and if a natural disaster or other emergency breaks out while he is in charge, he’ll need to step in for the response. He’s also filed bills at times. The one "that brought him the most notoriety" was a 1998 bill that sought to force more financial transparency from HMOs, according to a 2003 New York Times profile that said he’s held the acting governor role more times than anyone else in Massachusetts history. In most cases, though, an acting governor taking the reins is a brief, behind-the-scenes occurrence, involving close communication with the traveling governor and little impact on the day-to-day for most Massachusetts residents. Typically, the governor and lieutenant governor are not both away from Massachusetts for extended periods of time. The line of succession takes on more significance in the instances when the state is without a lieutenant governor — for instance, after Lt. Gov. Tim Murray resigned in 2013, Galvin regularly had to step in when then-Gov. Deval Patrick was away.Governor is not the only office whose duties can shift with travel plans. In Boston, if the mayor is away from the city or otherwise unable to perform their duties, the City Council president becomes acting mayor.', 'category': 'Politics', 'pubDate': 'Tue, 21 Feb 2023 14:42:37 EST', 'UID': '43dea19b91cb7e5d2e5333dadeddaaa4'}, {'title': "Arby's+?

And now some restaurants are betting they\'ll do the same for their favorite meals.Large chains like Panera and P.F. Chang\'s as well as neighborhood hangouts are increasingly experimenting with the subscription model as a way to ensure steady revenue and customer visits. Some offer unlimited drinks or free delivery for a monthly fee; others will bring out your favorite appetizer each time you visit.They\'re following a trend: The average American juggled 6.7 subscriptions in 2022, up from 4.2 in 2019, according to Rocket Money, a personal finance app."This is just another way for customers to provide a level of support and joy and love for our offerings," said Matt Baker, the chef at Gravitas, a Michelin-starred restaurant in Washington.For $130 per month, Gravitas Supper Club subscribers get a three-course takeout meal for two. Baker said Gravitas shifted to takeout during the pandemic but saw demand fizzle once its dining room reopened. The Supper Club — which serves about 60 diners per month — keeps that revenue flowing.The upscale Chinese chain P.F. Chang\'s also saw an opportunity to increase to-go orders with its subscription plan, which launched in September. For $6.99 per month, members get free delivery, among other perks.Other restaurants are experimenting with memberships, which let diners pre-pay toward their visits.El Lopo, a San Francisco bar, has 26 members in its Take-Care-Of-Me Club. They pay either $89 per month for $100 in dining credits or $175 per month for $200 in credits. When members come in, El Lopo starts bringing out their favorite dishes. Each visit, they can gift a free drink to anyone in the bar.El Lopo owner Daniel Azarkman started the club in March 2021 to encourage patrons to return as the pandemic eased. Now, he\'s hearing from restaurants all over the country who are interested in starting similar programs."What it really achieves is getting them in more often," he said.Rick Camac, executive director of Industry Relations at the Institute of Culinary Education, said he expects many more restaurants to offer subscriptions in the coming years. Consumers are accustomed to them, he said, and the regular monthly income helps restaurants manage their cash flow.To much cheese, not enough breadBut not all subscription programs have had success. In 2021, On the Border Mexican Grill introduced its Queso Club, which offered free cheese dip for a year for $1. The program stopped taking new subscribers a year later.Edithann Ramey, On the Border\'s chief marketing officer, said more than 150,000 people signed up for the Queso Club, and members visited seven times more often than the average guest. But the Dallas-based chain wasn\'t making enough to cover the cost of the dip.On the Border is now retooling the program and expects to reintroduce it later this year. It may charge more or move to a monthly model, Ramey said, but the subscription element will remain."It\'s becoming kind of a hot trend and we want to stay as a leading brand," Ramey said.Taco Bell is also tinkering with its $10 Taco Lover\'s Pass, which lets subscribers get a taco every day for a month. The pass was introduced in January 2022 and again in October; it generated buzz, but the chain is trying to think of ways to make it more valuable to consumers, said Dane Matthews, Taco Bell\'s Chief Digital Officer. A subscription could promise faster service, for example, or unlock unique menu items.Other restaurants have dropped subscriptions, saying they have their hands full just running the kitchen.In late 2020, SheWolf, an upscale Italian restaurant in Detroit, started sending subscribers a box of pasta, sauces and other treats for $80 per month. But when its dining room fully reopened six months later, it was too much work to put together hundreds of boxes.Still, SheWolf is keeping one foot in the subscription space. Dan Reinisch, the restaurant\'s beverage director, sends Italian wines to about 80 subscribers who pay $60 or more each month.Beverages get them in the Panera\'s doorsOther businesses have had better luck. St. Louis-based Panera had nearly 40 million members in its loyalty program in early 2020, but it wanted to convince them to drop in more often. So it launched a subscription program that offered unlimited coffee and tea for $8.99 per month. Customers started coming in several times a week, and about one-third of the time they bought food.Last year, Panera expanded the subscription. Now, members can pay $11.99 per month or $119.99 per year for unlimited hot and cold drinks. Annual subscribers also get free delivery.Eduardo Luz, Panera\'s chief brand and concept officer, won\'t share exact numbers but he said members now make up 25% of the chain\'s transactions."It\'s a huge traffic driver," Luz said.The idea quickly spread overseas. Pret A Manger, a sandwich chain owned by the same private company as Panera, launched its own coffee subscription in the U.K. in 2020. As of November, it was being used 1.2 million times per week. Pret also offers subscriptions in France and the U.S.Chris Hosford, a communications consultant in southern California, joined Panera\'s subscription plan a year ago. He passes four or five Paneras on his regular routes and often stops to grab a coffee and a bite to eat."It\'s not a huge amount of savings for me — probably $5-10 in the average month," Hosford said. "But I\'m good with that."

"When we eat the soup, it warms us," she says.Kilinçli and her mother have just picked up two steaming cups of lentil soup from volunteer chefs. They cook the soup in 70-gallon metal cauldrons. Because gas and electrical service has been knocked out throughout the area, the lentil soup is bubbling over in pots that sit on cinder blocks over open wood fires.Other food is also being distributed to the hundreds of thousands of people left homeless by the devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake. But throughout the quake-affected zone, lentil soup is a staple.It\'s a familiar dish – one of the traditional soups in the area around the city of Gaziantep, home to some 2 million residents. But that\'s not the only reason for its popularity."It is very quick to cook the lentil soup even in an emergency state. Also it is easy to serve," says Gülay Bozkurt, a nutritionist and food engineer in a municipal kitchen that used to prepare free hot meals to distribute to 21 locations across the city. Now the kitchen is serving meals to quake survivors and relief workers.People can eat it without any utensils, straight out of a bowl, she says. "You can eat it standing up. It is very practical.""It\'s very nutritious," she adds, rattling off statistics about the calories, grams of protein, carbohydrates and vitamins per serving."Also it\'s loaded with onions and garlic," which, she says, help ward off infections and colds.In short, it\'s a supersoup, especially during a humanitarian disaster. It warms the displaced, fuels rescue crews and serves as a comfort food for residents traumatized by the disaster, even those whose homes survived. Many of themcan\'t cook at home because the quakes destroyed gas and electric lines.Faruk Izi is the director of the kitchen where Bozkurt oversees the lentil soup. He says that in the first days of this crisis, when so many people had lost their homes or were afraid to return to them, two things were essential."First it was water and then it was soup," he says. The first meal his facility prepared after the earthquake was lentil soup, huge vats of lentil soup. Normally Izi\'s municipal kitchen provides 13,000 meals a day. On the first day after the quake he says they distributed soup to more than 200,000 people."The most important thing that people need is something hot. Therefore we started to cook soup," he says. "We offered lentil soup and tea. In this cold weather having something hot is very important and soup is very important."Their soup kitchen didn\'t sustain any damage, he notes – it\'s a government structure built to rigorous construction standards. The worst thing that happened was that some of the soup spilled.Mikail Dağtekin, the head chef at the kitchen, says part of the beauty of lentil soup is its simplicity."First we boil the water," he says. "We add some olive oil and salt to the water." Then he adds 45 grams of lentils –or roughly a quarter of a cup – for each person they plan to feed. For Dağtekin that means dumping 55-pound sacks of pinkish lentils into the pot. Then he adds in onions and garlic."Onion and garlic is the most important part of it. You can\'t do without them," he says.Dağtekin, a chef for 30 years, says there is no need for him to set a timer. "Boil it for a while," he says. When the lentils are soft, they\'re done. Then he mashes them with a long immersion blender that looks more like a power drill than a cooking utensil.If he has meat broth, he adds broth. If he has no broth, he skips it.Then he adds enough flour to thicken the soup.Meanwhile, in another pot he heats up cold-extracted olive oil – that\'s a process that reportedly retains more nutrients. (Some other chefs say they use liters of melted butter for this step.) To the oil, he adds cumin, bay leaves and ground pepper both black and red. Let the spices seep into the oil but don\'t let it get too hot, he says. Then he adds some tomato paste into the oil and spices.The final step in his recipe: Stir the oil mixture into the mashed lentils. Serve hot.Asked for the secret to making a really good lentil soup, Dağtekin doesn\'t miss a beat. "We add into it our love," he says with a warm, broad smile.At a time when so many people affected by the quake are facing so many hardships, the warmth of a traditional soup is about more than just the temperature of the bowl.Samantha Balaban and Tuğba Öcek contributed to this story [Copyright 2023 NPR]', 'category': 'International News', 'pubDate': 'Tue, 21 Feb 2023 13:19:00 EST', 'UID': '5ddac90b556209e32eeb6aef874480cf'}, {'title': 'Boston Public Radio full show: Feb. 14, 2023', 'link': 'https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/02/21/boston-public-radio-full-show-feb-14-2023', 'description': 'Listen to the full episode of Boston Public Radio from Feb. 14, 2023.', 'content': "Today on Boston Public Radio:Boston Mayor Michelle Wu joined for “Ask the Mayor,” discussing her new rent control proposal and taking listener calls.NBC Sports Boston anchor and reporter Trenni Casey talked about last weekend’s Super Bowl.Boston Globe advice columnist Meredith Goldstein discussed Valentine's Day and her “Love Letters” columns and podcast.Attorney General for Massachusetts Andrea Campbell joined for her first-ever edition of “Ask the AG,” discussing a new abortion legal hotline that can be reached by calling or texting (833) 309-6301.

It was one of the deadliest nightclub fires in the nation's history, and an event that has had lasting consequences for hundreds of families. Northeastern law professor and GBH legal analyst Daniel Medwed joined Morning Edition co-hosts Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel to discuss the legal issues related to the catastrophe and how the law has evolved in response to it. This transcript has been lightly edited. Paris Alston: So let's start with an overview. What happened that night? Daniel Medwed: At around 11 p.m. on Feb., 20, 2003, the heavy metal band Great White took the stage at the Station nightclub. And to accompany their first song, their tour manager launched some pyrotechnics. Unfortunately, the soundproofing in the walls and ceilings surrounding the stage contained some flammable foam, acoustic foam, that immediately ignited and created what some fire scientists would call a flashover effect, which is basically, as far as they understand it, when every combustible item in the vicinity of an enclosed space basically goes ablaze, creating lots of flames and heat and smoke. It caused a stampede. And as you said at the outset, 100 people died in the aftermath of this event, making it the second-deadliest fire in New England nightclub history, surpassed only by the infamous Cocoanut Grove disaster back in 1942, right here in Boston. Jeremy Siegel: This was devastating. And when you have this many people who were killed, there's obviously a lot of finger-pointing and discussion about who was at fault. How would you describe what went wrong here and who might legally or morally be deemed responsible for it? Medwed: Well, that's exactly right. There was a lot of blame being bandied about to different people, and it seemed like three different parties deserve to shoulder a lot of the responsibility. First and foremost, there was the tour manager, Daniel Biechele, who, after all, ignited those pyrotechnics. They were for gerbs, which are cylindrical devices that contain controlled sprays of sparks. There's a little bit of a dispute about whether he had authorization from the nightclub to do this, but he was certainly one of the people who shouldered a lot of the blame. Second, there were the nightclub owners, the Derderians, two brothers who purchased it back in 2000. Now, even though there were four exits in the facility, a lot of people died during the stampede because of a bottleneck in a narrow space near the front door. It made sense that a lot of people were trying to exit through the entrance where they had come from, right? In addition, this was aggravated by the fact that it had a maximum occupancy of 404 people and there were 462 people in the venue that night. Third, and finally, there were many perceived breakdowns in the fire safety inspection protocol process. And the city of West Warwick, the state of Rhode Island, also shouldered part of the blame here. Alston: Daniel, you just mentioned that there were breakdowns in the safety inspections. What exactly happened there? Medwed: On the one hand, there was the absence of an automatic fire sprinkler. So when this building was constructed back in 1946, it was designed as a restaurant. And under Rhode Island Fire Code at the time, a restaurant of that size did not require fire sprinklers. However, when it was converted decades later into a nightclub, that exemption should have disappeared and sprinklers should have been installed. A really fatal oversight here. On the other hand, there was the problem of that flammable acoustic foam that I mentioned earlier. The West Warwick fire marshal had conducted two fire inspections of the Station nightclub in the months preceding this event. During the first inspection, nine minor code violations were found. They were apparently remedied. And the second time around, the nightclub got a clean bill of health. But the fire marshal never detected the presence of this foam, which was actually against code at the time. Siegel: So what ended up happening legally here? Did anyone face criminal charges? Medwed: Yes. The tour manager and the Derderian brothers, who owned the Station, all faced criminal manslaughter charges based on two separate theories. One was that they had engaged in negligence, that their behavior was a gross departure, an extreme departure, from what a reasonable tour manager or nightclub owner would have done in this situation. The other theory was something called misdemeanor manslaughter, which holds that if you commit a petty crime and someone dies, you're on the hook for the homicide, regardless of whether you intended it, or was reckless, or anything. All three men ultimately pled guilty. Biechele went first and he received a sentence of four years in prison, 11 years of a suspended sentence and three years of probation. Now, there was some outcry from people who felt like this was quite lenient. But by all accounts, Biechele was incredibly contrite and remorseful, just crushed by these events. And that was a factor, a mitigating factor, in his sentence. One of the owners, one of the Derderians, got the same exact sentence through his guilty plea. And the other brother, who is considered far less culpable, got 500 hours of community service. Alston: So, Daniel, all of this is making me think about the Ghost Ship warehouse fire in Oakland, California, in 2016. I know, Jeremy, you were there when that happened, right? Siegel: Yeah, I actually covered the case that ended up in an acquittal and a mistrial for the people charged with manslaughter in it. Alston: Right. And we know there were some code violations involved with that fire. And Daniel, this was the deadliest building fire in the U.S. since the one at the Station nightclub. Which makes me wonder how those fire code and safety regulations changed, or didn't, in response to this. Medwed: Well, that's a great question. Obviously, these events continue to happen. So there's something beyond the fire code that's probably a problem here. But there were some positive developments in the aftermath of the Station tragedy, and here are a few of them: Immediately afterwards, the governor of Rhode Island issued a moratorium on the use of pyrotechnics in small venues. There also was a movement that began to gain traction to create fire sprinkler laws across the country. In addition, the organization that creates guidelines for fire safety, it's called the National Fire Protection Association, revised their guidelines and created better guidelines. So there were some good developments as a result of this.", 'category': 'Local', 'pubDate': 'Tue, 21 Feb 2023 10:56:36 EST', 'UID': '9dc0dbb493f35cf4519889dcef8ec862'}, {'title': 'Supreme Court showdown for Google, Twitter and the social media world', 'link': 'https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/02/21/supreme-court-showdown-for-google-twitter-and-the-social-media-world', 'description': 'In November 2015, ISIS terrorists carried out coordinated attacks across Paris, killing 130 people and injuring 400.

Among the dead was Nohemi Gonzalez, a 23-year-old American studying abroad who was the first person in her large family to graduate from college. This week, lawyers for her family and others are in the Supreme Court challenging a law enacted more than a quarter century ago—a law that protects social media companies from what the families see as the role of internet companies in aiding and abetting terrorist attacks. How the court rules could be a gamechanger for American law, society, and social media platforms that are some of the most valuable businesses in the world. What the law says At the center of two cases to be argued over two days is Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, passed by Congress when internet platforms were just beginning. In just 26 words, Section 230 draws a distinction between interactive computer service providers and other purveyors of information. Whereas newspapers and broadcasters can be sued for defamation and other wrongful conduct, Section 230 says that websites are not publishers or speakers and cannot be sued for material that appears on those sites. Essentially, the law treats web platforms the same way that it treats the telephone. And just like phone companies, websites that are host to speakers cannot be sued for what the speakers say or do. At least that is the way the lower courts have uniformly interpreted Section 230. They have said that under the law, social media companies are immune from being sued for civil damages over most material that appears on their platforms. That is so, even though, at the same time, the law has an apparently contrary objective: It encourages social media companies to remove material that is obscene, lewd, excessively violent, harassing or otherwise objectionable.The attack at the heart of the arguments This week\'s cases attempt to thread that needle. The Gonzalez family and the families of other terrorism victims are suing Google, Twitter, Facebook and other social media companies under the federal Anti-Terrorism Act, which specifically allows civil damage claims for aiding and abetting terrorism. The families allege that the companies did more than simply provide platforms for communication. Rather, they contend, that by recommending ISIS videos to those who might be interested, they were seeking to get more viewers and increase their ad revenue. Representing the terrorism victims against Google and Twitter, lawyer Eric Schnapper will tell the Supreme Court this week that when Section 230 was enacted, social media companies wanted people to subscribe to their services, but today the economic model is different. "Now most of the money is made by advertisements, and social media companies make more money the longer you are online," he says, adding that one way to do that is by algorithms that recommend other related material to keep users online longer. What\'s more, he argues, modern social media company executives knew the dangers of what they were doing. In 2016, he says, they met with high government officials who told them of the dangers posed by ISIS videos, and how they were used for recruitment, propaganda, fundraising, and planning. "The attorney general, the director of the FBI, the director of national intelligence, and the then-White House chief of staff . . . those government officials . . . told them exactly that," he says. Google general counsel Halimah DeLaine Prado vehemently denies any such wrongdoing. "We believe that there\'s no place for extremist content on any of our products or platforms," she says, noting that Google has "heavily invested in human review" and "smart detection technology," to "make sure that happens." Prado acknowledges that social media companies today are nothing like the social media companies of 1996, when the interactive internet was an infant industry. But, she says, if there is to be a change in the law, that is something that should be done by Congress, not the courts. The choice before the court Daniel Weitzner, the founding director of the MIT Internet Policy Research Initiative, helped draft Section 230 and get it passed in 1996."Congress had a really clear choice in its mind," he says. "Was the internet going to be like the broadcast media that were pretty highly regulated?" Or, was it going to be like "the town square or the printing press?" Congress, he says, "chose the town square and the printing press." But, he adds, that approach is now at risk: "The Supreme court now really is in a moment where it could dramatically limit the diversity of speech that the internet enables."There are many "strange bedfellows" among the tech company allies in this week\'s cases. Groups ranging from the conservative Chamber of Commerce to the libertarian ACLU have filed an astonishing 48 briefs urging the court to leave the status quo in place.But the Biden administration has a narrower position. Columbia law professor Timothy Wu summarizes the administration\'s position this way: "It is one thing to be more passively presenting, even organizing information, but when you cross the line into really recommending content, you leave behind the protections of 230." In short, hyperlinks, grouping certain content together, sorting through billions of pieces of data for search engines, that sort of thing is OK, but actually recommending content that shows or urges illegal conduct is another.If the Supreme Court were to adopt that position, it would be very threatening to the economic model of social media companies today. The tech industry says there is no easy way to distinguish between aggregating and recommending.And it likely would mean that these companies would constantly be defending their conduct in court. But filing suit, and getting over the hurdle of showing enough evidence to justify a trial--those are two different things. What\'s more, the Supreme Court has made it much more difficult to jump that hurdle. The second case the court hears this week, on Wednesday, deals with just that problem.What makes this week\'s cases so remarkable is that the Supreme Court has never dealt with Section 230. The fact that the justices have agreed to hear the cases shows that they have concerns. Justice Clarence Thomas has been outspoken about his view that the law should be narrowly interpreted, meaning little protection for social media companies. Justice Samuel Alito has indicated he might agree with that. But the views of the other justices are something of a black box.The cases are Gonzalez v. Google LLC and Twitter, Inc. v.

On Monday, the National Park Service announced plans to create 15,000 square feet of exhibit space that will explore the history of President Abraham Lincoln and the memorial that honors him. Construction for the project, which is estimated to cost $69 million, is expected to begin in March, the NPS said. It is scheduled to be completed in 2026, in time for the 250th anniversary of American independence.The exhibit space will include floor-to-ceiling glass walls providing a view of the long-hidden undercroft and the pillars that support the memorial above it, along with an immersive theater presentation that will project images of historic events onto the foundations. Visitors will learn how the memorial was constructed, as well as how the statue became an iconic backdrop for civil rights demonstrations. The museum will also highlight prominent figures who have the shaped the history of the memorial, like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and singer Marian Anderson."For more than a century, the Lincoln Memorial has been the crucible of American democracy, an enduring platform for free speech, the site of civil protests that still shape society, and the scene of national celebrations," said Will Shafroth, president and CEO of the National Park Foundation, in a press statement."Thanks to generous donors, the National Park Service will ensure the Lincoln Memorial continues to make history for another 100 years," he added. The project will also include upgrades for other areas of the site, including new restrooms and a larger bookstore.
