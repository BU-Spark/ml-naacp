# Evaluating Media Coverage of Demographics in Boston

## Project description
This project aims to create a proof of concept for evaluating media coverage of Black Americans and other demographics in Boston. 

This will be done through the data analysis of collected and processed information from GBH. We will examine: how different demographics are represented in the media; identify potential biases; and provide insights into the coverage patterns.
