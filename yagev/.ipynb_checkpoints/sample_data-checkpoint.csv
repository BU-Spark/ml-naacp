The fire began at around 10 a.m. 'in the rear of the first floor' at 309 Newport Ave., according to Quincy Deputy fire Chief Gary Smyth. The fire 'extended through the voids' of the structure and 'traveled to the roof,' said Smyth.  Residents were evacuated from the commercial building, which hosts a storefront on the first floor and apartments on the upper floors. One firefighter was transported for possible smoke inhalation. The fire was under control by 4 p.m., Smyth said. Quincy police limited traffic along Newport Avenue as fire trucks remained on-site. An investigation into the cause of the fire is expected to continue this morning.",['ENGLISH'],158,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

Coach Todd Bowles announced yesterday that Fitzpatrick was a full participant at practice despite dealing with a torn ligament in his left thumb. While there remains some concern about Fitzpatrick's thumb, he will be under center against Jacksonville.","'No limitations today,' Fitzpatrick said. 'Really, just kind of a trial run to see how it was going to feel and what the best way to do (things) going forward would be in terms of using it or not using it and all that. Today was a pretty positive day in that regard.' The right-handed Fitzpatrick wore what he called 'a special glove' over his left hand after tearing at least one ligament in his thumb that will require surgery at some point. He was hurt on the first dive of the Jets' 34-20 loss at Oakland last Sunday. Manziel goes tonight With Browns starting quarterback Josh McCown unable to play because of a painful rib injury, Johnny Manziel will start tonight against the Bengals, who treated him so rudely as a rookie on the road last year and now get him on their home turf. In his first NFL start last season, Manziel was chased, sacked, intercepted and taunted by Cincinnati in a 30-0 embarrassment. Now, Manziel's facing one of the league's four remaining unbeaten teams on short notice. McCown was unable to practice Tuesday night because of his ribs - and sore shoulder - and Browns coach Mike Pettine announced the decision to start Manziel before the team left for Cincinnati. . . .  Three years after Colin Kaepernick took over as starting quarterback and led the 49ers on a Super Bowl run, coach Jim Tomsula decided his struggling quarterback needed a break and his dormant offense needed a change. Tomsula officially announced yesterday that Blaine Gabbert will take over the starting role at quarterback from Kaepernick Sunday against the Falcons. Rams RB suspended St. Louis Rams backup running back Trey Watts has been suspended indefinitely for violating the NFL's substance abuse policy. It's the second suspension this fall for Watts, who was out the first four games. Coach Jeff Fisher said he wouldn't deal with Watts' future with the franchise until the offseason. For now, the Rams are keeping a roster spot open. Fisher said the second violation took place before the first suspension began. Fisher also said Watts was 'on the road to recovery.' 'It ends up being another positive (test),' Fisher said. 'Unfortunately we'll lose him for the remainder of the season, but emotionally, psychologically and physically he's doing good.' JPP wants to play New York Giants defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul seemingly is ready to play Sunday against Tampa Bay.

5,"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,Football-Patriots,Can't replace these Patriots,,KAREN GUREGIAN,"One of the major NFL storylines last weekend was the heavy toll injuries took, particularly on significant players from teams in the playoff hunt.  The Steelers lost running back Le'Veon Bell for the season. The Ravens will be without wideout Steve Smith Sr. while the Chargers also lost Philip Rivers' big gun Keenan Allen for the rest of the year.  The Patriots aren't immune to injury issues either, having already seen left tackle Nate Solder (biceps) exit for the season. But at this stage, with the trade deadline passed, teams won't have an easy time adding players to cover up for injuries.  ","So who can't the Patriots lose?  It's subjective of course, but here's our take on the five Patriots that are the least expendable - not counting the most obvious choice, Tom Brady. 1. Rob Gronkowski Tight end Significance -Gronkowski is a nightmare in the red zone, and just about every other zone. He's a beast to cover, and because of all the attention he draws from double teams, everyone else has much more space to roam. He's also a devastating blocker in the running game. Backup plan - Scott Chandler would see a lot more action with Gronk out, and given his frame and ability to catch the football, would make up for some of what he brings to the table. Unlike Gronk, teams won't have to gameplan around him, or double-cover him. Bottom line - He's the weapon in Brady's arsenal that puts the Pats over the top, and makes the offense  special and capable of beating any defense. There is no replacing what he does. He's one-of-a-kind. 2. Malcolm Butler  Cornerback Significance - He's stepped into the top corner role, and while quarterbacks certainly don't fear him and aren't afraid to throw in his direction, he still makes his share of plays. While beaten quite a bit, particularly against the bigger receivers such as Eric Decker of the New York Jets, he remains unfazed and continues to compete and hang in against top receivers. Backup plan - The gap between Butler and the level of corners on the Pats roster is large, so Devin McCourty would likely have to make the switch from safety back to corner. As it is, he's been playing closer to the line, taking on tight ends and some receivers when the situation warrants.  Bottom line - The Pats weren't able to swing a deal before the trade deadline for an upgrade at corner. As it is, they are going to have their hands full when they hit stops in Denver trying to neutralize both Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders, or down the road in the playoffs with other multi-faceted offenses. Take Butler, your best corner, away from the mix, and the prospects look so much more grim. 3. Jamie Collins Linebacker Significance - As Devin McCourty said of Collins, 'Dude's not human.' He's part athlete, part freak of nature. He does everything, from stuffing the run, to rushing the quarterback, to covering tight ends. He's all over the field making plays. He's also been known to hurdle an offensive line to block a kick. Collins just does so many things well. Backup plan - It would be a rotation of players. Jonathan Freeny would probably see most of the snaps, but Jerod Mayo, Dane Fletcher and, perhaps, Jon Bostic would also take turns trying to make up for the loss of Collins.  Bottom line - It was a tough call deciding between Collins and Dont'a Hightower. In many ways, they're a two-headed monster who are both vital to the defense. Ultimately, there's no one who can replicate what Collins brings to the table in terms of his freakish athleticism and how that translates on the field. 4. Sebastian Vollmer Left tackle/Right tackle Significance - Right now, he's protecting Brady's blind side, after moving over from the right side when both Solder and Marcus Cannon went down to injury. The Pats are thin at tackle as it is given those injuries, and losing Vollmer would really put them in a bind, not to mention put Brady at risk.  Backup plan - At some point, Cannon should be able to return from his toe injury, so he would be the choice to return to left tackle, with Cameron Fleming remaining on the right side.  Bottom line - While Brady does get rid of the ball quicker than anybody, they'd be playing with fire if Vollmer was lost, too. Even with Brady's quick release, the thought of a line without both Solder and Vollmer isn't comforting. Having Cannon and Fleming as the primary tackles against Denver's DeMarcus Ware and Von Miller? Not a pleasant thought. 5. Stephen Gostkowski  Kicker Significance - Arguably the best kicker in the game, between his consistency - he's made a franchise record 26 straight field goals - and the fact he's tied for the league lead with 40 touchbacks on kickoffs. Backup plan - Find someone off the street, and at this stage, there would be slim pickings. Bottom line - The Steelers lost kicker Shaun Suisham at the start of the year and are now on their fourth option at kicker. Last week they punted when faced with a 53-yard field goal chance in a 16-10 loss to Cincinnati. Think about that. There's no one to be found in November who knows how to kick in the elements like Gostkowski. He is a weapon in winning the field position battle with his kickoffs and on the scoreboard since's he's so automatic on extra points and field goals. That kind of dependability is vital on special teams. Lose it, and it can cost you games. Just missing the cut LB Dont'a Hightower Run defense suffers but they still can get by. WR Julian Edelman Brady would certainly miss his binkie, but Danny Amendola is a reasonable facsimile. S Devin McCourty The quarterback of the secondary would be missed but Patrick Chung and Duron Harmon would manage. RB Dion Lewis No one can replicate his moves, but James White would take on third down back role.",['ENGLISH'],953,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

6,"Newspaper, Newspapers",FEATURES,Fashion,Facial expression,"Embrace shaving, grooming campaigns to help worthy causes",GRETTA STYLE - Gretta Monahan,"No-Shave November is officially upon us, and those of you who don't know much about it yet are about to find out: It's the unexpected intersection of men's facial hair grooming habits and disease prevention. ","Imagine an entire month without having to spend time shaving. Sounds pretty great, no? And it's all in the name of a worthy cause. It was started by a Web-based, nonprofit organization devoted to raising funds and awareness to support cancer prevention, research and education. And the idea is for men to start conversations by embracing their hair - which many cancer patients lose - and letting it grow. In addition, the guys donate the money they usually spend in a month on shaving/­grooming to cancer prevention at no-shave.org.  At the same time, overlapping with No-shave November is Movember, the annual campaign (since 2003) to raise awareness and funds for men's health with, well, mustaches. Men shave clean at the beginning of the month, then grow a mustache over the following 30 days. The hope is that new 'stashes will start conversations about why the men did it, which will then lead to a collection of donations for the efforts. Since its first year, the Movember Foundation has raised $650,000 for more than 1,000 programs to fight prostate and testicular cancer. (This year, it's branching out to include mental health.) Find them at us.movember.com. So if you see a slew of men walking around looking particularly scruffy or hairy in the next few weeks, at least now you'll know what the heck is going on.  Here's my two cents: I love these awareness-raising efforts. They're brilliant. On the other hand, if men are going to eschew their regular grooming efforts, we still don't need them walking around looking like unkempt mountain men, or worse, Sasquatch.   To that end, here are a few facial hair products and services that give guys a helping hand in their new hair growth adventures.  Undeniably cool in its retro (some might even say handsome) packaging, the local company Brothers Artisan Oil is made by two Boston brothers who indeed have impressive beards all year long. Their product comes in such masculine (but yet subtly herbal) scents as rosewood and cedarwood oil, sage and mint forest oil and orange and grapefruit oil. Shop online at brothersartisanoil.com. A little more outrageous in its smells and branding is Simply Great Beard Oil, which comes in Whiskey, Pumpkin and Lumberjack-scented versions. The national company's oils are vegan and cruelty-free, to boot. Find them at beardoilshop.com.  So what about those guys who still want to stay trimmed and under control as they try out their new look? (Both Movember and No-shave November encourage the well-groomed as well as grooming atheists.) The folks at Roosters (518 Tremont St., roostersboston.com) specialize in neatening gentlemen's facial hair properly, but also teaching them to do it on their own.

7,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Local,DISASTER UPS FEAR OF ISLAMIC STATE TERROR,,OWEN BOSS,"New intelligence reports that an Islamic State affiliate may have brought down the Russian Metrojet airliner over the Sinai Peninsula with a bomb would suggest a new level of sophistication for the terrorist group and raises the prospect other western targets could be next, security experts told the Herald.","'I think that clearly the Islamic State has both the will and the means to commit a mass casualty attack like this against civilians,' Northeastern University terrorism expert Max Abrahms said. 'The fact that the Islamic State could take down a commercial airplane in today's day and age certainly suggests a higher level of capability.' U.S. intelligence agencies are operating under the theory that a bomb exploded on the plane, a U.S. official said yesterday Although analysts have not yet made a definitive determination of what caused the aircraft to crash, officials say investigators are combing through electronic and digital communications intercepted from extremist groups in Egypt and Sinai - including the Islamic State - to see whether a terrorist group played a role. Russian officials say the Airbus A321-200, carrying mostly Russian vacationers home to St. Petersburg, broke up in midair 23 minutes after takeoff. If Islamic State militants are found to be behind the possible bombing, Abrahms says it would indicate the terror group is operating at 'a higher level of capability than many of us had assumed.' No U.S. citizens were aboard the flight, so direct access to the crash site, the flight data and voice recorders and plane parts by U.S. aviation, law enforcement and intelligence agencies has been limited. FBI bomb experts have not been invited to the scene, the official said. British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said yesterday his government concluded there is a 'significant possibility' that a bomb caused the crash. Should the crash be found to be an Islamic State response to increased Russian involvement in the campaign against the barbaric terror group in Syria, the tragedy would end up being a 'be careful what you ask for because you might just get it moment' for Russian President Vladimir Putin, said professor Owen Cote of Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Securities Studies program. 'They wanted to flex their muscles, they wanted to go in, they wanted to make a big show about how they're backing up their ally and then this happens,' Cote said about the Russians. 'It will be very interesting to see what Putin does next.' News agencies reported Monday that a U.S. satellite detected a midair heat flash at the time of the Metrojet fall from radar screens. Russian news media, however, reported from the makeshift forensic lab in St. Petersburg that the bodies of the crash victims bore no signs of an explosive impact. If an Islamic State link is discovered, American travelers should be wary of boarding flights leaving Middle Eastern countries, said Edith Flynn, a terror expert and professor emeritus at Northeastern University. 'Unfortunately getting bombs onto airplanes is still too easy,' she said. 'They will boost security but it is always an uphill battle. The more you improve the more they try to circumvent. I do think that ISIS is a very dedicated enemy and I'm sure they would be just as happy downing an American plane as they would a Russian plane.'

O'Brien initially denied any involvement in McKenna's murder but later admitted to being present at the time of the slaying, Kennedy said. O'Brien is the fourth person to be arrested in the killing. Quincy attorney Michael Moscaritolo faces murder and burglary charges. His girlfriend Lauren Kalil is charged as an accessory after the fact. Police zeroed in on O'Brien off a Home Depot receipt found in Ferguson's Dorchester home, Kennedy said. Surveillance video from the South Boston Home Depot showed an Isuzu Rodeo registered to O'Brien's father. A search of the SUV turned up four guns linked to McKenna, Kennedy said. Witnesses told police O'Brien had been asking people in his neighborhood whether anyone wanted or knew someone who wanted to buy the guns. O'Brien was wearing Air Force 1 sneakers at the time of his questioning, which matched prints at the bloody crime scene, Kennedy said. McKenna was found dead in his Marshfield home by a friend on Sept. 16, the victim of an apparent robbery.

11,"Newspaper, Newspapers",FEATURES,Food,Spreading Revolution,Brewer - returns - to Hub - with - radically - tasty beers,THIRSTY THURSDAY - Kerry J. Byrne,"Newton native Josh Deth carries big shoulders in the Chicago beer world as the owner of Revolution Brewing (revbrew.com), one of the nation's fastest-growing beer makers. ","He's back in Boston this week to introduce his progressive, hop-centric suds to beer lovers in his hometown - which just so happens to be one of the nation's most sophisticated by competitive craft beer market standards. 'It's certainly like a coming-home party,' Deth told the Boston Herald on Monday night at Canary Square in Jamaica Plain as he sipped Revolution's inky Deth's Tar Russian imperial oatmeal stout, then hosted a dinner for beer-industry folks with pub owner Mike Moxley. 'We always say you want to open up markets in places you want to visit, and Boston is obviously attractive to us.'  So attractive that Boston is Revolution's first market outside Illinois or Ohio.  The Revolution name, Deth said, is a tribute to the rapid changes in the American beer industry and in the life of this former community organizer and self-described 'socialist with a capitalism problem.' The brand is represented by Soviet-style red star imagery.  The Communist nostalgia is nice for marketing. But at the end of the day, everyone is a capitalist, and Deth just raised millions to fund an $8 million expansion that will help him meet rapidly rising demand for his product. He brewed and sold just 8,000 barrels of beer in 2012 and expects to produce more than 100,000 barrels in 2016.  'Craft beer, and our beer, is moving so fast, and personally, my life has changed dramatically,' Deth said. 'Suddenly I'm the boss, and we're building a family of people working for us.' Revolution is best known for canned and draft American-style India pale ales that are bold, balanced and flavorful without bludgeoning the palate with a hammer-and-sickle of hops in the crude contemporary fashion. Anti-Hero IPA is 'our No. 1 horse,' Deth said. It's dry hopped with a blend of five American varietals that accentuate aroma over bitterness and displays pine and citrus fragrance and flavor. Revolution's Hero label is a series of single-hop IPAs. We pounded a frothy pint of Mosaic Hero at Canary Square, celebrating a nouveau American variety that's the centerpiece of so many 'juicy' IPAs. Oats in the mash add to its creamy mouthfeel.  Fistmas Ale, Revolution's winter seasonal, is a sort of fruitcake in a can: a bready red ale accented by flavors and aromas of stone fruits, ginger root and orange peel. Deth's Tar is an extraordinarily complex Russian imperial oatmeal stout that's aged in used bourbon barrels from the Heaven Hill and Old Forester distilleries. It meshes masterfully with Revolution's brand imagery. Revolution beers are being distributed around the state by the Massachusetts Beverage Alliance, a consortium of five distributors, including Burke in the Boston area.",['ENGLISH'],473,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

12,"Newspaper, Newspapers",INSIDE TRACK,The Inside Track,Matt tackles tough talk for kids with Crohn's,,GAYLE FEE - INSIDE TRACK,"When former Patriots muscle Matt Light was a kid and he skinned his knee, his dad would whack him on the arm and say, 'Now your knee doesn't hurt so much anymore, does it?'  And that's how Light looked at protecting Tom Brady's blind side from blitzing linebackers for 11 years while battling Crohn's disease. 'When I was getting the snot kicked out of me on the field, my stomach hurt, so I forgot about everything else,' he joked.","But Light's battle with the autoimmune disease that causes inflammation in the lining of the digestive system was no joke. In June 2005, while the rest of the team was receiving their Super Bowl rings, Light was in the hospital after having 18 inches of intestine removed. 'I lost 50 pounds overnight, that was a fun period, but I battled back,' he said. 'In an eight-week period it went from ugly to worse to a whole lot better.' Matt missed some training camp but made it back to play the last preseason game and the rest of the season. 'I bucked the trend,' he said. Light said his condition, which started in 1996, went undiagnosed for years because he would write off his stomach distress to a bug or lifestyle changes. Finally, in his rookie year with the Patriots, doctors gave him the news: He had Crohn's disease. 'It's like I won something,' he joked. 'I have an overactive immune system to the nth degree. And that's never a good thing.' Crohn's disease is thought to be genetic, but there are environmental factors as well. Light says he believes that changes in the food supply could be at fault. 'I'm not a doctor, but if people ask me, I tell them I think it has to do with how we live in today's world,' he said. 'Go back 100 years, there was no genetically modified food. And look at the speed that food is produced. Common sense tells you that if it's too good to be true, it's not that good, and unfortunately 95 percent of what we eat is too good to be true. We need to go back to how they ate in biblical times.' Light will be honored as the The Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America's Man of the Year tomorrow night at the organization's 46th Fete of Food and Wine at the Four Seasons. Dr. Adam Cheifetz, director of the Center for Inflammatory Bowel Disease at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, will receive the Humanitarian of the Year award for his work and his dedication to Crohn's and colitis patients. Light said the importance of the event is not the title he's getting, but the opportunity for him to spread his message to young patients suffering with Crohn's. 'Let's face it, as an adult you can handle things. But you see a kid 6, 7 or 8 years old that's been through hell and back, they are looking for anything to latch onto,' he said.  'So I say, 'Look, I ran with fat people and had the heck beat out of me on a constant basis. I still got to go out and do what I do and live a fairly normal life.' And one of the most rewarding things about dealing with this stupid disease is to be able to tell that to a kid who has it.'

13,"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,Baseball-Red Sox,Maybe Clay should stay,,RED SOX BEAT / SCOTT LAUBER,"Picking up Clay Buchholz' option? That was easy. Now, the hard part: deciding whether to keep him. Across baseball, there was little doubt the Red Sox would exercise their $13 million option on Buchholz for next season, one major league source recently calling it a 'foregone conclusion.'  But retaining the oft-injured 31-year-old doesn't mean he won't be traded, a scenario that multiple rival talent evaluators believe is a real possibility considering Buchholz is relatively affordable at a time when the price for pitching is skyrocketing and the Sox have veteran depth in the middle of the rotation.","What the Red Sox lack, of course, is a proven No. 1 starter. President of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski hasn't been shy about saying he plans to land an ace this winter. And assuming he's able to talk principal owner John Henry into relaxing his aversion to long-term contracts for pitchers in their 30s, the widespread belief within the industry is Dombrowski will make a strong push for free agent David Price. Dombrowski traded for Price during the 2014 season while with the Detroit Tigers, and the lefty wouldn't cost the Sox their first-round draft pick as compensation for the signing. The addition of Price - or any other No. 1 starter, either via free agency or a trade - would leave Buchholz, fellow right-handers Rick Porcello and Joe Kelly, 200-inning lefty Wade Miley and promising young lefties Eduardo Rodriguez and Henry Owens to fill out the rest of the rotation. For non-math majors, that's two pitchers too many. Porcello is set to begin a four-year, $82.5 million extension, ironically the type of contract Dombrowski didn't want to give him in Detroit last year and the reason he traded him to the Red Sox in December for outfielder Yoenis Cespedes. In all likelihood, Dombrowski is stuck with Porcello now. Kelly, meanwhile, is 27, the same age at which Cleveland Indians righty Corey Kluber morphed from Just Another Pitcher into Dominant Ace. Kelly can spare us another offseason Cy Young prediction, but we can't deny his upside might be greater than any Sox pitcher save Rodriguez. That leaves Buchholz and Miley. And while the former is due to make as much money next year as lesser lights such as Atlanta Braves righty Edwin Jackson and Chicago White Sox lefty John Danks, Miley will make more than half of Buchholz' salary and has a track record of pitching up to twice as many innings. Talk about good value, even for a back-end starter. Trading Buchholz would serve mostly to free up $13 million to throw at a free agent pitcher. But before showing him the door, say this for Buchholz: At least the Red Sox know what to expect from him. After averaging 20 starts and 126 innings over the past eight seasons and often taking a prolonged turn on the disabled list, he's unlikely to suddenly grind out 35 starts and 200 innings. But he is capable of providing at least 100 high-quality innings worthy of a No. 2 starter. The same can't be said of Porcello or Kelly. Not yet. Porcello was horrendous for most of the season because he inexplicably strayed from his signature sinker. By the time he got back to it - 3.14 ERA in August and September - the ship had long sailed on the Sox as a playoff contender. Likewise, Kelly was lost for most of the season because he insisted on trying to overpower hitters with his high-90s fastball. It took a demotion to Triple A to convince him to use his offspeed stuff, and upon returning to the majors, he posted a 2.35 ERA over his last eight starts. Better late than never, to be sure. But it's one thing to pitch well during garbage time. It's another to do it when the season still means something. 'Yeah, I don't put much into that,' pitching coach Carl Willis said recently. 'Listen, when you're at this level and you go out and every game is televised and covered, particularly in a market like Boston, there's a tremendous amount of pride involved in what you do. These guys worked extremely hard through the year, but very seldom do you see it come together right away. Sometimes it's a progression. It takes some time.' Willis suspects Porcello's late-season success will give him confidence next year. And he's particularly bullish on Kelly learning valuable lessons from his struggles. 'It's so easy for (Kelly) to say, 'Hey, I throw 98 mph, so I'm throwing 98 mph. I'm not going to get beat with my third pitch,' ' Willis said. 'But now that he has allowed himself to use his offspeed and seen the success he's had doing it, well, all of a sudden, he trusts that. He had a situation in New York (Aug. 29 against the Mets): Ball one with a fastball, he threw four changeups in a row, struck a guy out. First inning against the Blue Jays (Sept. 9): 3-2 (count), here's a slider, locks the guy up. Back in May, we probably don't see that.' And before the Sox trade Buchholz, they better be sure they will see that from Kelly more often.",['ENGLISH'],817,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

14,"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,Football-College,Milano a BC strongman,,RICH THOMPSON,"Boston College strong side linebacker Matt Milano is playing up to the standards of his predecessors. The 6-foot-1, 218-pound  junior from Orlando, Fla., has fulfilled the job requirements with the same level of intensity as Kevin Pierre-Louis (Class of 2013, now with the Seattle Seahawks) and Josh Keyes (2015, Kansas City Chiefs practice squad).","'His game is at a real high level,' BC coach Steve Addazio said of Milano. 'I think that is one of the lesser things talked about because he has followed a couple of really good players at that position. . . . (But) he is really coming into his own.' Milano came to BC after earning all-state honors at Dr. Phillips High in Orlando, where he registered 100 tackles, 18 tackles for a loss and three sacks his senior season. Milano watched and learned as Pierre-Louis and Keyes harassed opposing quarterbacks and cut down ballcarriers behind the line of scrimmage. Milano will look to do more of both when the Eagles (3-6, 0-6) face North Carolina State (5-3, 1-3) Saturday afternoon at Alumni Stadium. 'They had a lot of influence on me while I was just observing,' Milano said of his predecessors following yesterday's practice at Alumni Stadium. 'I was just watching the things they did wrong and right and just learning what they did and finding ways to work that into my own game.' Milano has started all nine games this season and is tied with strong safety John Johnson for fourth on the team with 46 tackles. Milano recently moved into a third-place tie with Clemson's Shaq Lawson in the Atlantic Coast Conference with 61/2 sacks. He is tied with teammate Harold Landry for fourth in the ACC with 121/2 tackles for a loss in a BC unit that leads the nation in total defense and run defense. 'I think the first two games of the season helped me transition into the meat of the schedule,' Milano said. 'I feel comfortable at the 'Sam' because it's a little closer to the ball and I'm not as much in space as I would be as a safety. But when I get out in space, I can play there as well. Everybody has to be on top of their game (vs. NC State) because if you make a mistake, any mistake, they are going to take advantage of that.' Milano compares favorably with both Pierre-Louis and Keyes as juniors. Pierre-Louis played in nine games and had 85 tackles with 41/2 for a loss and two sacks. Keyes played in 11 games and recorded 30 tackles with five for a loss and 31/2 sacks. Both Pierre-Louis and Keyes nearly doubled their outputs as seniors. 'Each guy is a little bit different, but Matt's coverage abilities have been outstanding,' BC defensive coordinator Don Brown said. 'His coverage ability is probably a little stronger than KPL and Josh. 'His linebacker ability was slightly behind but not anymore. He is becoming a more complete player.'",['ENGLISH'],465,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

15,"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,Football-Patriots,Brady stays alert,Uses QB sneak as dangerous weapon,JEFF HOWE,"FOXBORO - Tom Brady forever will be remembered for his ability to rack up passing yards by the thousands, but he also has developed a reputation for a feat of feet. Brady's propensity to hurl himself into a car crash for the sake of a yard has become legendary. He is, without question, the best of his generation at the quarterback sneak, which is a comically ironic name for such a violent play. Brady has a high degree of strategic aptitude to diagnose the appropriate times to execute the plunge, but it's not like he is the only quarterback who can find an open gap a couple feet in front of his nose. There's an underrated level of toughness also involved.","'When you get into that situation, guys are trying to hurt the quarterback,' said former offensive lineman Damien Woody, who played five of his 12 NFL seasons with the Patriots. 'Most teams know when it's third-and-inches, the Patriots aren't going to hand the ball off. They're going to sneak it. So guys are going to pile up. They might try and take a few shots at Brady in the scrum, so he has to be tough in those situations.' When Brady has kept the ball on third- or fourth-and-1, he has converted on a whopping 92-of-101 attempts (91.1 percent) in his career, including the playoffs. He is 7-of-8 this season. Excluding Brady, NFL ball-carriers have converted 69.3 percent of third- or fourth-and-1 situations since 2000. That includes quarterbacks, running backs and anyone else who took a handoff on those plays, so while it's hardly a perfect comparison, it shows what kind of weapon the Pats have when Brady dives. Peyton Manning, often compared to Brady, has converted 15 of a measly 22 attempts (68.2 percent) of those sneaks since entering the league in 1998. Every other Patriots quarterback since 2000 has converted 21-of-24 keepers (87.4 percent) on third- or fourth-and-1, including Matt Cassel (9-of-10), Drew Bledsoe (7-of-7), Michael Bishop (3-of-4), Jimmy Garoppolo (1-of-2) and Damon Huard (1-of-1). Clearly, Bill Belichick has coached it well throughout his tenure, but Brady has been the golden boy. 'We've done a good job of that over the years, so it's a good weapon for us,' Brady said. 'Whenever coach calls my number, I've got to go out there and try to execute it. So there are little nuances to it, try not to get landed on. I've taken some good hits in there, too.' The strategy behind the sneak can be fascinating because of the layers within each play call, which starts in the huddle and sometimes evolves from there. In the opener against the Steelers, for instance, the left defensive tackle slid outside on third-and-1, and Brady screamed, 'Alert! Alert!' That changed the play to a sneak that yielded 2 yards. Brady has used the 'alert' call often this season, but the Patriots were predictably mum when asked to reveal its meaning. Perhaps Brady calls two plays in the huddle, and the 'alert' triggers the second option. On third-and-1 against the Dolphins, for example, Brady made the 'alert' check at the line when two defensive tackles covered the center, and he pitched left to running back LeGarrette Blount for no gain. Brady then shouted, 'Alert! Alert!' as he walked to the line on the ensuing fourth-and-1 when the two defensive tackles left a free lane, and he dived ahead for a 1-yard conversion. 'There are different situations and variables,' center David Andrews said. 'Any time (Brady) wants to do it, we need to be ready to do it. It's just a thing he controls.' Brady had two successful sneaks with different calls against the Jaguars. He made his standard calls before the initial third-and-1 sneak in the second quarter by identifying the middle linebacker, shouting, 'White 80!' and taking the snap, which probably meant the sneak was called in the huddle. But the second sneak was far more interesting, as Brady screamed, 'Scooby Doo! Scooby Doo!' at the line before taking the third-and-1 sneak for 2 yards. Without the benefit of knowing exactly why Brady barked about a cartoon hero, one guess is the standard 'alert' call either checked into another play or was taken out of the playbook for that game, and the Scooby siren was another audible altogether. 'The guys on our unit, we kind of get into a rhythm and how (Brady) likes to do things,' Andrews said. 'We can kind of figure out what he is thinking at times, but sometimes, he makes (the sneak call) when we're not thinking it. He does a good job of reading the defense and knowing when and when not to.' Brady has one last decision to make. Far more often than not, he takes the low road behind the center, but he went airborne after an 'alert' check to score a fourth-and-1 touchdown against the Jets, reminiscent of the 2011 AFC Championship Game against the Ravens. Obviously, that route is only in play at the goal line because it's all or nothing, and you can't fumble once you break the plane of the end zone. Over or under, audible or otherwise, Brady has it mastered, and it's just another way for the Patriots to attack a defense. 'It is pretty impressive,' Andrews said. 'He does a great job of it.'",['ENGLISH'],846,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

17,"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,Basketball-Celtics,Indy takes C's best shot,"Green mix it up, but lose again",STEVE BULPETT,"INDIANAPOLIS - The Celtics' last shots of both the first and second halves were most memorable last night. The first produced a highlight you'll be seeing all day. The second, an Avery Bradley missed 3-pointer, left the C's just short. The 100-98 loss to the Pacers was the Bostonians' third straight defeat after a season-opening win over Philadelphia. Their best shot of the night wasn't even a shot.","With 1.1 seconds left in the first half, the C's had the ball under the Pacers basket, and Brad Stevens called a timeout to design a fullcourt play. So Jae Crowder inbounded the ball and threw it the length of the floor, hoping to connect under the C's hoop with Jared Sullinger. But the ball went off the glass and through the strings. The Celtics reached deep in this one. At one point in the fourth quarter, they were running with a lineup of Isaiah Thomas, Evan Turner, David Lee, Jonas Jerebko and, making his first appearance in an NBA game, R.J. Hunter. That group had some success, leading to a tight race to the finish. The game was even at 93 when Paul George hit his fifth 3-pointer of the game and Jordan Hill added a jumper to give Indy a five-point lead. But Bradley took care of that on the Celts' next two possessions, nailing a trey and a 19-footer to tie the proceedings with 1:05 left.  George and Thomas missed jumpers on the ensuing possessions, and Bradley sent Monta Ellis to the line, where he hit two free throws with 13.7 on the clock. The Celts then worked the ball to Bradley, but his contested 3-pointer merely grazed the front of the rim. The clock drained on the rebound. The Celtics changed three of the five names in the starting lineup, but they couldn't replace the first quarter trouble. After the first quintet stumbled from the gate in the first three games, Stevens was hoping a move to Amir Johnson and Sullinger - in place of Lee and Tyler Zeller - would create more flow. And when Marcus Smart came up injured with a sprained right toe and pushed the Celts' top scorer, Thomas, into the starting lineup, well, certainly that had to get the scoreboard moving, right? Alas, things were even worse for the C's in the first period here. The starters went 5-for-13 from the floor, with a string of seven straight misses leading to an overall 5-for-19 start. The Celtics scored just five points in the quarter's last 6:45, two of them coming on a Turner drive with 3.9 seconds left that cut the Indiana lead to 23-16. Bradley was 3-for-6 on the way to 10 points in the period. The rest of the Celts had six points on 3-for-14 shooting. Oh, and they committed five turnovers and gave up six second-chance points on six Pacers offensive rebounds. Not exactly what Stevens had in mind. It got a bit better for the visitors early in the next frame. Lee finally found some groove, and Turner hit Lee and Jerebko for cutting layups as the Celts got within a point. The Pacers shot back with an 8-2 run, but Hunter hit his first NBA field goal attempt - a 20-footer from the left - in a 7-0 Green burst that evened the score at 32. George Hill, George and Ellis canned treys as Indiana took its edge back out to 10. Thomas had seven points in the last 1:35 (16 in the period) to get the Celts within four, but Jordan Hill converted an offensive rebound for the last of the Pacers' 15 second-chance points in the half. After Crowder's non-shot of the night, the Celtics went into halftime with a 49-43 deficit. George came out of the break with two more 3-pointers, giving him four in a 6:19 span dating back to the second period, to push the Pacers back in front by nine, but the new starters appeared to find a rhythm.  Crowder had hit an early trey in the third, and he made two free throws to start a 16-6 run that gave the Celtics a 62-61 lead, their first time ahead since 9-7. Still Indiana was able to take a 73-72 advantage into the last quarter. It took a few minutes, but the C's got some traction there. Jerebko scored on a drive, and Lee rebounded a missed Hunter trey and passed out to Thomas, who hit from beyond the arc. Thomas then found Turner for an open trifecta, and the guests had helped themselves to an 82-78 lead.",['ENGLISH'],691,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

18,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Local,Cops: Mama's boy done in by ... mom,Sex offender sent ma stolen $$,ANTONIO PLANAS,"A Level 3 sex offender accused of duct-taping a teen girl to a chair in an Andover home invasion last summer was a mama's boy gone bad who did it so he could mail her money - but dear old ma helped the cops nail him, police said. ","Peter Bardzik, 53, charged yesterday with kidnapping, home invasion and larceny, told the 16-year-old victim during the July 31 ordeal: 'I just need cash, my mom means everything to me and she needs the money so I have to do this,' an Andover police report said.  Bardzik, whose last known address was in Lynn, is registered as a Level 3 offender for a rape conviction in 1980. He was held on no bail pending a dangerousness hearing. A woman who yesterday picked up the phone at the Bardzik home in Chicopee said, 'I'm sorry, I have nothing to say.' Cops say that in the home invasion, Bardzik - with a red bandana over his face and sunglasses - got into the house and found the teen at the bottom of a staircase. He duct-taped the teen's hands behind her back, and taped her feet and torso to a chair. He then taped index cards over the girl's eyes before making off with about $300 from her purse, police said. But the crime quickly began to unravel, authorities said. Andover cops that same night went to an apartment on a report of breaking and entering. A resident told cops there were clothes that were not his in a closet - including tan shorts, white sneakers that were muddy, black boxers and a green T-shirt, police said. The clothes matched the description the teen victim said the suspect wore. Bardzik's mom came into the picture last month after police publicly released the suspect's description from surveillance video. Tips ultimately led to Bardzik's mom, who Andover cops said was 'visibly upset' last month when she identified her son from the image. Bardzik's mom also told police that during 'Peter's troubled life ... she is the only one who kept in touch with him,' cops said.  'Peter sent her a birthday card in August (2015) that contained $300 in cash ... which included a hand note from Peter ... 'Thanks Mom,' ' the police report said. Andover cops said that when they identified Bardzik as their suspect, he was already locked up on various unrelated offenses.  His lengthy four-decade-long record features numerous entries including rape, burglary, assault, kidnapping and making threats, police said. Prosecutor Heidi Rose Mader said in court yesterday when cops who were interrogating Bardzik pressed him about the safety of the teen girl, he told them to turn off an audio recording. He then said, 'She doesn't need to be afraid. I'm sorry. I've lived with that every day,' Mader said.",['ENGLISH'],440,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

19,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Columnist-Adriana Cohen,Time for commander in chief to wake up,,ADRIANA COHEN,"Intelligence officials delivered a sobering wake-up call to all of us yesterday - including our feckless commander in chief. We learned an explosive device could have taken down the Russian jet found in the Sinai Peninsula Saturday, killing all 224 people on board - including children. ","If terrorists are ultimately to blame, it's one of our worst fears come true. What we do know is that if ISIS can blow up a Russian passenger plane, they can do it to us.  They can also wreak havoc on our domestic subway trains or commuter rails that have virtually no security and are highly vulnerable to a terror attack.  Amtrak and other U.S. train providers are officially on notice.  In addition to U.S. airlines, security must also be ramped up on all cargo before it's too late - cargo in planes and in our ports.  At this point it's time the president stopped taking selfies and renaming mountains. As commander in chief, he has a duty to take the radical Islamist threat seriously and implement real measures to combat it, not symbolic ones.  Since the U.S. airstrikes began in Iraq over a year ago, President Obama still doesn't have a military strategy to defeat ISIS. What kind of message does that send to foreign enemies worldwide - including the Islamic State?  Incompetence? Or weakness?  Take your pick.  Over a year into this so called 'coalition' war with ISIS, it's ridiculous the leader of the free world has no viable plan of action, other than mostly ineffective airstrikes and blowing over $500 million of our tax dollars to train 50 moderate 'rebels' - which has been a complete bust.  Any of the Republican presidential contenders would have had a strategy by now if they were in Obama's seat. Especially given the fact that ISIS has already released videos threatening to attack America and raise the black jihadi flag at the White House.  If you think that scenario is far-fetched, you've forgotten 9/11, where al-Qaeda hijacked Flight 93 - headed for either the Capitol or the White House. If it weren't for the brave heroes onboard who rushed the cockpit and diverted the plane, radical Islamist terrorists could've hit all four targets they were aiming for that fateful day.  With a weak president and secretary of state, coupled with radical extremists on the march, we're sitting ducks for another terrorist attack.  It's just a matter of time.

20,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Local,Chism jury pool faces grilling from lawyers,Were told not to follow teen's claims,LAUREL J. SWEET,"Prospective jurors - seated last month for the murder trial of Philip Chism, but kept in the dark for weeks about the teen's alleged mental meltdown - will be grilled today about whether they kept their pledge to ignore media coverage of the case.","Their answers to Judge David A. Lowy about any knowledge of Chism's self-inflicted physical abuse, conversations with an imaginary friend and expressed desire to be shot to death by a vigilante - could determine whether Lowy drains the jury pool entirely and starts from scratch. Chism is charged with the 2013 rape and murder of Danvers High School math teacher Colleen Ritzer, 24. Lowy yesterday ruled Chism, 16, competent to assist in his own defense based on a 67-page report filed by Framingham child psychiatrist Dr. Virginia Merritt, who studied him during his court-ordered 20-day commitment at the Worcester Recovery Center. Merritt's findings are impounded. Jurors were originally told the trial would be over by Veterans Day; however, due to the mental evaluation delay, the case could now go to Christmas. State Jury Commissioner Pamela J. Wood said one option available to Lowy if he finds the pool has been tainted by Chism's troubles and the trial's unexpected delay is to take jurors from the pools of other Essex County courts. 'It is unusual,' Wood told the Herald. 'It only happens a handful of times a year.' Chism appeared compliant in court yesterday. He was seen mouthing responses to his defense team's questions, but continued to ignore his mother. Denise Regan, his lead counsel, asked Lowy to consider taking frequent 15-minute breaks during testimony and to conduct jury impanelment from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., rather than full business days, for her client's benefit.  'The long days are definitely a problem for Mr. Chism,' Regan said.",['ENGLISH'],300,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

23,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Columnist-Peter Gelzinis,VETS CRY FOUL ON PRO PAYOFF,,PETER GELZINIS,"Marvin Pena, an Army combat vet from Saugus who served two tours in Iraq, says a warm feeling always came over him when he watched crowds at Gillette Stadium and Fenway Park pause to pay tribute to brother and sister vets.","'I thought to myself, 'Hey, this is nice ... that these teams are taking the time out of the goodness of their hearts to honor our service and our sacrifice.' ' Marvin Pena doesn't feel that way anymore. He's taken a look at a report written by Arizona Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake. It details how the Department of Defense reimbursed professional football, baseball, hockey and basketball franchises in Boston and across the country - as well as some colleges - to the tune of nearly $7 million for many of those feel-good 'salute to the troops' moments. 'I thought they were doing this stuff out of the goodness of their hearts because they wanted to,' Pena said. 'Now you find out they were getting paid. Teams that are pulling in millions and millions of dollars ... and they have to be paid? It's more than disgusting. It's heartbreaking.' For the past few years, the DOD budget has hovered between $550 billion and $600 billion. So what's a measly $6.8 million? A bunch of toilet seats? The truth is this virtual drop in the DOD slush bucket may well prove to be its most cynical waste of taxpayer money.  McCain and Flake aptly titled their report, 'Tackling Paid Patriotism.' 'It sickens me that these teams need to get paid to show the love,' said Tom Lyons, who saw a lot of combat as Marine in Vietnam some 45 years ago. Lyons was the catalyst behind a memorial to the 25 sons of South Boston who died in Vietnam. It pre-dated The Wall in Washington by more than a year and was paid for by the nickels and dimes the community raised. Lyons was honored last night by the Fisher House for a career of serving veterans and their families in Boston and across this state. And though he was very grateful, he was also more than a little angry. 'I never got a welcome home after Vietnam,' he said. 'None of us who were lucky enough to make it back did. But you know something? I'd rather get an honest no welcome than a welcome home that was bought and paid for.' Tom Kelley is a recipient of the Medal of Honor for his heroism on a swift boat in Vietnam. He is now the president of the Medal of Honor society. And he's not happy either. 'I understand the DOD has an advertising budget,' Kelley said, 'but it shouldn't be used like this. We shouldn't be paying the NFL or Major League Baseball for a bunch of seats, or a little time on the field. That's not a genuine tribute to those who served. It's just promotion.'",['ENGLISH'],439,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

'The immediate aftermath was just unbelievable. To think that if it had gone a little further in, it would have hit me in the face was just - wow. I couldn't  - believe what happened.' Field said she was heading north on Interstate 91 about 11 a.m. on her way to the community theater program in Chicopee where she volunteers as a costume-maker, when a box truck in the middle lane hit a large wooden post, 'sending it up into the air and right through my windshield.' 'There's glass all through the backseat of my car. I was covered in little specks of glass,' Field said just after the horrifying accident that state police warned 'could have had a fatal outcome.' 'It's amazing,' Field said as she waited for her damaged Subaru Forester to be repaired. 'I have the teeniest little scratch on my hand and that's it. It could have been a lot worse.' Field said a cellphone photo she snapped shortly after the  - incident - showing how close the splintered post came to crushing her face - really drove home how fortunate she was to be alive. 'People who were behind me stopped to see if I was all right and they said, 'Should we call the paramedics?' And I looked around and said, 'Well, no, I'm not really hurt,'' Field recalled. 'It's unbelievable. It ended up about even with the steering wheel, but it didn't hit me.'  State police spokesman David Procopio was quick to point out that 'damage caused by debris in the roadway as extreme as (yesterday's) incident is, thankfully, not common.'  But he stressed the accident should serve as a reminder to truck drivers to properly secure their loads. 'What unfortunately is more common is the problem of un-secured loads on the back of commercial and contractor trucks,' Procopio said.  'As many drivers can attest, it's not uncommon to see tools or material on trucks that do not seem properly tied down. The load can become a projectile and cause a tragedy.' In an effort to prevent fatal, - projectile-related crashes, Pro­copio said the state police 'Truck Team,' as one of its  - priority missions, regularly  - enforces secured-load laws. 'We would like to remind contractors and commercial drivers of their requirement to secure all tools, materials, and product they are carrying,' Procopio said, adding, 'The driver of that car was truly blessed  - today to escape without serious injury.' Investigators are urging anyone who may have been driving in the area at the time and saw a truck drop a block of wood 'similar to a post people have holding up their decks or porches' to call state police at 508-820-2121.",['ENGLISH'],485,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

25,"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,Football-Patriots,Redskins' Reed presents some problems,,CHRIS MASON,"FOXBORO - Kirk Cousins was the star of the Washington Redskins' comeback win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers two weeks ago, but tight end Jordan Reed certainly deserved the award for Best Supporting Actor.","With 28 seconds remaining and trailing by six points, the Redskins faced a third-and-goal at the 7-yard line. They lined up with four wide receivers to the left, and Reed split to the right by himself. Cousins took the shotgun snap, and stared Reed down as he ran a slant. Cousins hit him in stride and Reed ran untouched for the game-winning touchdown.  'Playmaker,' Pats safety Tavon Wilson said flatly of Reed. 'They needed a play and they made a play. That's what it comes down to. When your team is needing a play, going out there and making a play. He definitely made those plays for those team.' The reception was Reed's ninth of the second half, and his second touchdown. The Redskins trailed 24-7 at halftime, but once the third quarter started, Cousins turned to his tight end, targeting Reed 11 times. 'He's not your normal tight end,' Wilson said. 'He's more of a receiver. They use him all over the place, he's got a big route tree. They're not afraid to put him anywhere, and he gets open, so we've got his hands full with him.' Reed has a playing style similar to Kellen Winslow and Aaron Hernandez. Reed was recruited by the University of Florida as a quarterback, but learned tight end and made the switch shortly after Hernandez left for the NFL. Pats safety Devin McCourty sees Reed's unique hybrid skills on film.  'I think he is a different kind of tight end as far as lateral quickness, being able to go vertical,' McCourty said. 'I don't really think we've seen a tight end really like him (this season). He's not a huge dude, but he has a lot of wide-receiver qualities. You see him outside; how he runs routes, how he gets off the line of scrimmage. 'He can go out there and give you three or four moves at the line of scrimmage, which you don't always see tight ends do. There are a lot of times they're just trying to out-physical and push off on defensive backs. He is able to kind of do both.  'I think he is a little different breed of tight end that we've seen so far earlier this season.' The third-year player's growth has been slowed by a series of injuries. As a rookie in 2013 he was placed on IR with a concussion, and he battled a hamstring injury much of last season. Another concussion caused him to sit out Week 5 and 6 games before returning against the Bucs leading into Washington's bye. Because of his trouble staying on the field, Reed is not a household name. McCourty believes he should be. 'I think Jordan Reed is a way better tight end than what people give him credit for,' McCourty said. While fans may underestimate Reed, it's clear the Patriots will not.",['ENGLISH'],466,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

28,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Local,Newcomers split on taking pay raise,,MARIE SZANISZLO,One of two women who unseated the City Council's longest-serving members at Tuesday night's election said she will not accept the 14-percent pay raise councilors gave themselves.,"High school teacher and small-business owner Annissa Essaibi-George, who beat Stephen J. Murphy in the race for the at-large seat he has held for 18 years, said she will forgo the raise the council approved by a vote of 9-4 last week, hiking their pay from $87,500 to $99,500.  'I'd like to see that money support some important programming,' said Essaibi-George, 41, although she has not yet decided which programs. Andrea Campbell, the 33-year-old lawyer who defeated Charles C. Yancey in District 4, said she will accept the pay raise, although she would have voted against it and would like to explore tying future raises to the city's median household income - as Councilors Matt O'Malley and Ayanna Pressley have proposed - or having an independent body set them. Murphy voted in favor of the raise, whereas Yancey, who has represented parts of Dorchester, Mattapan, Roslindale and Jamaica Plain since his seat was created 32 years ago, voted against it. As of early yesterday evening, Campbell and Essaibi-George said they had received calls and messages of congratulations from several of their future colleagues but had yet to hear from the men they unseated. Their election will double the number of women on the 13-member council when they take office in January - a clear message, they said, that voters wanted more diversity among their elected officials. 'We're not quite there yet, but we're getting close,' said Campbell, who will be one of only three blacks on the council in a city where the majority of residents are women and minorities. 'When you look at the demographics of the council, it doesn't reflect the demographics of the city. ...Voters in District 4 think it's time we make room for the next generation to serve.' Both Campbell and Essaibi-George said they were undecided about Councilor Frank Baker's proposal to change the terms of office for city councilors from two years to four to coincide with mayoral elections.",['ENGLISH'],353,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

It was a much stronger effort from Winnipeg (8-4-1) after getting crushed by the Canadiens, 5-1, on Sunday. Coach Paul Maurice didn't like his team's game, including his own performance. The bounce-back in Toronto was more than respectable. Defenseman Dustin Byfuglien, cleared by the NHL after a hearing for a hit on Canadiens forward Brendan Gallagher, scored early, and Mark Scheifele also had a goal. Ondrej Pavelec stopped 24-of-26 shots in the first half of back-to-back games. The Jets visit Ottawa tonight. Counterpart James Reimer had another good game in net for the Leafs (2-8-2), making 29 saves. Pierre-Alexandre Parenteau and Leo Komarov scored for Toronto. A defensive miscue by the Leafs allowed the Jets to get on the board 3:41 into the game as a wide-open Mathieu Perreault found Byfuglien, who drove the net and scored his third goal of the season. Toronto tied the score on the power play at 8:22 when a shot attempt by Tyler Bozak deflected off Jets defender Mark Stuart's stick and right to Parenteau at the side of the net. The Jets took the lead back 37 seconds later. With the Leafs unable to get the puck in their own zone, Winnipeg played tic-tac-toe as Scheifele went top shelf over Reimer. The lead lasted until 12:17 into the second period when, on a delayed penalty, Roman Polak carried the puck to the crease, throwing a centring pass in front. The puck banked in off Komarov's skate and in. Elsewhere in the NHL - Edmonton rookie Connor McDavid will be out indefinitely because of a broken left collarbone. He was expected to undergo surgery yesterday, with a recuperation period expected to stretch into months. 'We're talking about months,' Oilers general manager Peter Chiarelli told a news conference. 'We don't have a particular timeframe, but as I said, plural, months. There will be plates and screws involved (in the surgery).' McDavid was injured Tuesday night in the Oilers' 4-2 win against the Philadelphia Flyers.

31,"Newspaper, Newspapers",BUSINESS,,FCC eyes WILD ties to China,,DONNA GOODISON,Boston radio station WILD-AM 1090 is among the U.S. radio stations the Federal Communications Commission will investigate for alleged ties to a California company whose broadcasts are partly financed by a subsidiary of the Chinese government.,"The FCC's investigation into West Covina, Calif.-based G&E Studio Inc. follows a Reuters report of a covert Chinese radio network broadcasting pro-Beijing programming in more than 12 American cities, including Boston. G&E is owned by James Su, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Shanghai, but a subsidiary of Chinese state-run radio broadcaster China Radio International has a 60 percent stake in G&E and produces some of its U.S. radio programming, Reuters said. WILD is among stations the FCC will examine because G&E has an ownership interest in it, FCC spokesman Neil Grace said. Silver Spring, Md.-based Radio One Inc. owns WILD, but G&E has oper­ated WILD since June 2011. Under a time-brokerage agreement, Radio One sold WILD's airtime to G&E, which supplies the programming. 'The FCC will initiate an in­quiry into the facts surrounding the foreign ownership issues raised in the (Reuters) stories, including whether the commission's statutory foreign ownership rules have been violated,' Grace said. Radio One and G&E did not return Herald calls.

32,"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,Football-Patriots,"Jones happy, healthy",Super excited to return to field,JEFF HOWE - PATRIOTS NOTEBOOK,"FOXBORO - Patriots defensive tackle Chris Jones would do it all over again. Jones played Super Bowl XLIX on a torn calf that he suffered shortly before the game, the Herald learned yesterday through a source. There was no chance that he would miss the biggest game of his career against the Seattle Seahawks. Jones declined to discuss the details of the injury, which essentially required a nine-month recovery. He missed the entire offseason workout program and all of training camp while opening the season on the physically unable to perform list. He officially returned to practice Tuesday.","'The whole process took longer than I anticipated,' Jones said. 'So as I got going and was able to work out, it was little victories from there on out. This is another victory of getting back to the field.' The Patriots have until Nov. 24 to decide whether to activate Jones or end his season. That decision can be made at any moment and he is eligible to play on Sunday against the Washington Redskins, but the Pats do currently have five healthy defensive tackles on the active roster in Dominique Easley, Malcom Brown, Alan Branch, Sealver Siliga and Akiem Hicks. Whenever the Patriots do make the call, Jones will be ready. After all, he has already proven a willingness to play through some of the most adverse circumstances. 'I'm excited,' Jones said. 'I'm ready to go. I'm pushing myself to try to get better now.' The long absence has been difficult, but Jones would not fret. 'Competitively, I want to be out there with my teammates to be able to support them, but honestly, we're doing great right now,' Jones said. 'I'm excited about that. I can't complain with where we're at right now.' Mom knows best Linebacker Dane Fletcher spent a week last winter mulling retirement before he found encouragement from a number of important advisers. Fletcher suffered a third torn ACL on Dec. 28 during the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' season finale, and he wasn't sure if he wanted to endure another rehab process. But Fletcher returned to the Foxboro area in January to spend a little time with former Pats teammates, including quarterback Tom Brady, defensive end Rob Ninkovich and linebacker Jerod Mayo, who have all dealt with major knee injuries. They talked Fletcher into continuing his career. And, oh by the way, Fletcher's mother wasn't going to let him give up. 'My mom doesn't take no for an answer,' Fletcher said. 'She is crazy like that. I told her what I was thinking. I said, 'Hey, I don't know. I'm debating on retiring. I don't know what I'm thinking.' She said, 'No, you're not.' I said, 'No, I'm not then.' ' Like Jones, Fletcher has been on the PUP list, and he also returned to practice Tuesday. Also like with Jones, the team has until Nov. 24 to active him for this season. 'I'm not going to lie,' Fletcher said. 'After it happened, I had my head down and kind of just thought that was it - three ACLs, and I was mentally over it. The cool thing about this team and this organization is I came back here when they were in the playoffs, and I was out of the playoffs, obviously, and talked to a lot of the guys like Ninkovich and Mayo and Tom. These guys have been around for me. They just remind you, 'Why not come back?' I still have a lot left in me, and thank God they did that and talked me into it because now I am here with my brothers again. It was a terrible year away (in Tampa Bay), I'm not going to lie. I'm just excited to be back, be a part of things again and eager to get back on the field. 'I'm 29 (years old) now, and everybody kind of goes through that when you get injured. The first couple weeks, you don't know where you stand. I was definitely back and forth with it. Once I really geared up and set my mind to it, I've been gung ho and haven't looked back one instant.' Injury surprises Wide receiver Julian Edelman and offensive lineman Ryan Wendell were surprising additions to the injury report with knee ailments. Edelman's injury is not a serious issue, according to a source. On the bright side, linebacker Dont'a Hightower (ribs), offensive lineman Josh Kline (shoulder), running back Brandon Bolden (hamstring) and defensive end Trey Flowers (shoulder, knee) were removed from the injury report. Oh brother Who knows if there was ever a chance for the Patriots to pry cornerback Jason McCourty from the Tennessee Titans prior to Tuesday's trade deadline, but twin brother and Pats defensive back Devin McCourty was oblivious to any rumors because he was in meetings throughout the day. 'Someday, we'll play together,' Devin McCourty said. 'Just not this year.'",['ENGLISH'],763,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

33,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Local,Trump baits Rubio in N.H. trash-talk duel,,CHRIS CASSIDY,"MANCHESTER, N.H. - Republican heavyweights Donald Trump and Marco Rubio lashed out at each other while campaigning through the Granite State, both trying to cast the other's political organization as free-falling. ","'Rubio's going down next,' Trump said, with dozens of sign-waving supporters standing behind him on the steps of the New Hampshire State House yesterday morning. Rubio, meanwhile, pointed to the latest polls, which show Trump losing ground - and in some cases, the lead - while he surges.  'When Donald comes across a poll he doesn't like, he gets weird and does these sorts of strange things,' said Rubio after an event at St. Anselm College in the afternoon. 'And that's fine. That's the kind of campaign he wants to run. He's entitled to it.' But Trump was the one who put Rubio on the defensive most of the day, as he re-hashed a controversy over personal expenses on the American Express credit card issued to him by the Florida Republican Party when he was a lawmaker.  'Marco Rubio has a disaster on his finances,' said Trump. 'He has a disaster on his credit cards.'  That left Rubio later having to re-explain his handling of the card.  'Every month I would get a bill at my home, and I'd review it,' Rubio told reporters. 'If there was something that was personal, I would pay it ... What I've said is what I would do differently is I just wouldn't have done any personal things on it because I would have avoided all the confusion that it's created in the minds of some.' He added that the attacks are five years old, dating to his 2010 U.S. Senate race against former Gov. Charlie Crist and that the state's Ethics Commission had cleared him.  But Trump also tried to expose another potentially tricky situation for Rubio - the backing Rubio received last week from billionaire hedge-fund manager Paul Singer.  It was a coup for the Rubio campaign, but Trump, who is refusing super PAC money, called politicians fueled by big donors 'puppets' and linked Rubio to Singer's ideology.  'Paul Singer represents amnesty and he represents illegal immigrants pouring into the country and now he's with Rubio,' said Trump. 'Rubio is totally in favor of very, very lax rules ... Now Rubio is surging in New Hampshire? I don't think so.'  One of Trump's major advantages - the free media exposure his celebrity status generates - will be on display again this weekend, when he hosts 'Saturday Night Live.'",['ENGLISH'],401,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

It was touching but repetitive, until one woman embraced him and tearfully whispered, 'This is like losing my hairdresser.'","His staff and colleagues are still smiling over that. But far from being a frivolous analogy, it spoke of a relationship that doesn't enjoy the iconic status of barbers and cabbies, who everyone knows are authorities on everything under the sun. They hear it all. Hairdressers hear it all, too, but not in the same way. 'I don't think guys talk about things like having your heart broken,' said a stylist known as DKC. 'But we sure hear a lot about things like that, things our clients probably haven't told anyone else.' DKC was 17 when she was brought to America from Albania by an older brother who paid her way through hairdressing school. Now, at 35, she's a master of her craft, having learned what can't be taught in school. 'Some things you have to learn as you go along,' she explained. 'They did teach us not to talk about religion or politics, but you can't teach how to become a personal part of someone else's life.  'I know how my clients like to have their hair cut and what color they want it to be, but that's just how it starts. Pretty soon you're sharing more and more, like marriages going bad or what substance abuse is doing to a loved one. 'The conversations can become very emotional, because the clients trust that what they say to you will stay with you; it never goes further.' DKC has found that to be a two-way street. 'I don't share what's happening in my own life, but if I'm down I guess they see it in my face. It's amazing how close you can get with someone you trust.' So there was sadness last Saturday when she ended a six-year tenure at a shop in Quincy, mixed with great anticipation over beginning a new chapter today in Needham, having said yes to an offer she couldn't refuse. 'Some clients are coming with me, and some can't,' she said. 'I am heartbroken over that. Yet I know there are others I am about to meet and that excites me. That's what makes hairdressing so much more than just a job.' And that's why a copy of this will be mailed to Dr. Frank, helping him realize what a compliment he received that day.",['ENGLISH'],387,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

37,"Newspaper, Newspapers",BUSINESS,BusinessMarkets,Credit agencies not best source of counseling,,RICK SHAFFER,"Many more people suffering from credit problems have begun turning to credit counseling agencies in the past few years.  In some cases, such agencies are recommended by consumer advocates. However, many, including myself, think that using credit counseling agencies is not a good idea. ","Here's a few reasons why: · Very often, con­sumers can accomplish the same results themselves without using a credit counseling agency; · Some, though cer­tainly not all, credit counseling agencies have been found not to be honest and/or legitimate; · Credit counseling agen­cies generally do not present consumers with their best options. If you're having serious financial difficulties, your best bet is to seek the counsel of an experienced bankruptcy attorney - even though there is a good chance you may not end up needing to file for bankruptcy protection.  Why is it best to speak with a bankruptcy attorney? In many cases, there are numerous methods to improve or fix your financial condition that you and credit counselors may not be aware of, but a good bankruptcy attorney will be. Just one example: In some states, including Massachusetts, if a credit card company does not take the correct actions to collect on credit card debt you owe after a certain period of time, they are barred from taking further action to collect that debt. Additionally, hiring a bankruptcy attorney improves your chances of successfully negotiating an acceptable settlement with your creditors. It is unfortunate, but true, that many creditors will ignore your attempts to speak to them about a settlement, but will readily respond, and often negotiate, when they are contacted by your bankruptcy attorney. Moreover, although filing for bankruptcy is cer­tainly not a pleasant experience, it's not the end of the world. Indeed, after a bankruptcy becomes final, you often can qualify for a mortgage or car loan within one to three years, and a new credit card within a year. Remember, for many people, if they don't declare bankruptcy, they will never be able to clear up their credit. Note too that in many cases, consumers are able to retain their homes and car, and some of their other possessions, even though they declare bankruptcy. Ironically, if you do end up filing for bankruptcy, under the new bankruptcy laws you will be required to first speak with a credit agency.

38,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Local,Women make history in Hub and the state,,Joyce Ferriabough Bolling,"The post-election story in the media was how two veteran Boston city councilors lost their seats to newcomers. In with the new, out with the old. It was a bittersweet moment to see Charles Yancey leave office, because he has been a soldier for his community and a legendary institution-builder. He fought to build the B2 police substation, which helped put a dent in crime. And the Mattapan Library he championed is one of the most beautiful in the city.","But there was another important story: Boston's municipal elections were, quite literally, a history-making mother lode.  All the women the Massachusetts Women's Political Caucus worked to elect to the City Council won: Ayanna Pressley, Michelle Wu, Annissa Essaibi-George and Andrea Campbell. That doubled the number of women on the council, creating a healthy voting bloc.  MWPC also endorsed the new mayor of Medford, Stephanie Burke, only the second woman to be elected mayor in that city. And Nina Liang became the first Asian-American woman elected to the Quincy City Council.  The fact that three of the four women elected to the Boston City Council are of color is also welcome news to Women's Pipeline for Change. That group recently released a publication, in collaboration with UMass's Center for Women in Politics and Public Policy, lamenting the fact that fewer than 100 women of color have been elected to office in Massachusetts history.  Another reason to cheer: Pressley, who just 10 years ago became the first woman of color ever elected to the council, has been the city's top vote-getter for three terms running.   Now much is expected of Campbell, whose life story is one of triumph over adversity and who as an attorney brings a wealth of knowledge to the job. The same goes for Essaibi-George who, as a teacher and a small-business owner, also boasts a life experience that makes her a leader to watch. Yet, while the election results are inspirational, there are still many obstacles to overcome.   For starters, there has never been a popularly elected woman governor in this state, and there is only one mayor of color, Lisa Wong of Fitchburg, who leaves office in January. No Bay State woman of color has ever been elected to Congress or to the U.S. Senate.  Sadly, the number of female elected officials is vastly out of sync with our population. That sends a poor message about the value of gender and diversity, to say nothing of the kind of sensitivity to discourse and lawmaking only women can contribute.

40,"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,Basketball-Celtics,Stevens shifts lineup,Three new starters inserted vs. Pacers,STEVE BULPETT - CELTICS NOTEBOOK,"INDIANAPOLIS - The Celtics were planning to shake things up anyway with their starting lineup last night, but an injury to Marcus Smart threw another tremor into the group. Thus, Brad Stevens sent three new starters out among the first five against the Pacers. The coach had already decided that Amir Johnson and Jared Sullinger would replace David Lee and Tyler Zeller. Then Smart reported a sprained left toe Tuesday night and was unable to get through shootaround here yesterday morning. That moved Isaiah Thomas into the opening lineup. Avery Bradley, able to play through a sprained right hand, and Jae Crowder were the holdovers.","The original shuffle was brought about by slow shooting starts in the  first three games. 'We're just trying to see if we can find a smoother group as far as playing together early,' Stevens said. 'Obviously it's a little bit unique, because we were going to start them with Marcus, too. But with the late notice, I really didn't want to change. 'It's still very much in figuring-it-out phase, so it's nothing that anybody's not doing. It's more, 'Let's see if these two guys play well together.' Ånd I do think that being able to get Amir on the floor a little bit more right now on both ends is good for our team.' Smart was wearing a boot on his left foot to protect the toe. The genesis of the injury is a mystery. 'I have no idea,' Stevens said. 'And from what I've been told, neither does Marcus. Supposedly (Tuesday) night he called Ed (Lacerte, the trainer) and said, 'My toe hurts.' He went and got treatment at 10 or 10:30 at night. He doesn't remember anything happening in the game or in practice. Then (yesterday) morning he tried to do some stuff or get loosened up for shootaround and wasn't able to it. He still wanted to give it a couple of hours, (but) it didn't get better.' Butler memories stir Even in his third season with the Celtics after leaving Butler University, coming back  to Indianapolis for a game is still a big deal for Stevens. 'It's great,' he said yesterday as the Celts prepared to take on the Pacers. 'I got a chance to see one of my former players (Tuesday) night and a couple of friends real briefly, then I stayed in my hotel and worked. 'But it is great to be back, and it's fun, because when I open my window I can see Eli Lilly, where I worked, and I can see Lucas Oil Stadium, where we played (Butler losing to Duke in the 2010 NCAA final). It just brings back a lot of great memories.' The player to whom Stevens referred is former Butler center Andrew Smith, who's been battling cancer. 'He's got a bone marrow transplant (today),' the coach said. 'I've seen Andrew through a lot of really tough stuff over the last two years, and that son of a gun always responds. He's as tough as they come, and I have no doubt that he'll respond again. 'It was funny. He asked about how we're doing. 'Are we coming together? How are we playing?' Like, those are small problems, aren't they - in the big picture?' . . . Another visitor on an Indiana homecoming was R.J. Hunter, who grew up here as his father, Ron, was coaching IUPUI. He then moved with the family to Atlanta and played for Dad when he got the Georgia State job. Though during the early part of summer league it seemed Hunter was slated to spend much of this season with D-League Maine, Stevens seemed to indicate the rookie may soon have an opportunity to be part of the Celtics rotation. 'He's doing well,' Stevens said at yesterday's shootaround. 'He hasn't gotten a chance in the games yet, but he's not far from not only getting a chance but being an impactful guy. 'He's really gotten better on the defensive end, and shooting is a real positive. We'll see if he can impact us sooner rather than later.' Hunter acquired 10 tickets for friends and family for last night's game and expected some others to be on hand, as well. He certainly knew the way to Banker's Life Fieldhouse. 'I've been to countless games (there), probably over 100,' Hunter said. As for his favorite Pacers player growing up, he said, 'Reggie (Miller), of course, but I think Jermaine O'Neal was a hero. He ran Indy. I would say J.O., because he was killin' there for a while.' Strides for Hunter Hunter has clearly moved ahead of second-year swingman James Young on the depth chart. Young and rookieJordan Mickey were sent down to Maine on Tuesday, but their D-League visit will be brief. 'You know what?' Stevens said. 'They're having two-a-days and just thought rather than doing a 40-minute shootaround and a 15-to-20-minute shooting session before the game that it would be a lot more beneficial to get three to four hours of hard, good work in a good practice. So that was our thought process. They'll be back with us (tomorrow) or (today) for practice.'",['ENGLISH'],792,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

42,"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,Hockey-Bruins,Nowhere to go but up,B's bottom out on penalty kill,STEPHEN HARRIS,"When the doors to the Bruins dressing room opened after a short Garden practice yesterday, players were busy packing their equipment bags for the trip to Washington and tonight's game against the Capitals. A short time later, nearly every player abruptly left the room, leaving just four guys sitting at their spots: Ryan Spooner, Brett Connolly, Jimmy Hayes and Alexander Khokhlachev. Where did everybody else go? To a meeting on penalty killing. There was a lot to talk about with most of the roster potentially involved on the PK.","The urgency of the meeting was not entirely surprising, given the B's poor performance while skating shorthanded in Tuesday night's 5-3 loss to Tyler Seguin and the Dallas Stars at the Garden - a game in which the Stars scored on 3-of-4 power plays. The Bruins have allowed at least one power-play goal in nine of the last 10 games. Overall, the B's have given up 12 PPGs on 40 opportunities. A kill rate of just 70 percent leaves the PK ranked 30th in the NHL. The B's are in the somewhat bizarre situation of being first in the NHL on the power play (34.2 percent) and last on the PK. And it hardly helped that the club lost one of their best penalty killers, Chris Kelly, to a broken leg in the first period against the Stars. For the most part, the Bruins have had fairly strong PK play in recent seasons, finishing 12th in the league last season (82 percent) and eighth the year before (83.9). So there was a lot to talk about yesterday. 'I think our whole penalty kill has to get better,' coach Claude Julien said. 'Right now I feel that we're on our heels. The confidence level is not where it should be. That's our job - as players, as a team, as a group, as a coaching staff - to create that confidence that you're going to need to kill penalties.' It can't do wonders for the PK unit's confidence knowing that after being ruined by Seguin, the B's follow up by facing a player even more dangerous in man-up situations in Capitals star Alex Ovechkin, who the past two seasons has merely scored 25 and 24 power-play goals. 'It takes sacrifices,' Julien told the media and, presumably, his players. 'Whether it's blocking shots, whether it's being more assertive in certain areas, having better sticks. Those are areas that have to get better for us. I feel we've got the players in our dressing room to be a better penalty-killing team. Right now we just haven't done a good enough job. It's a work in progress, but it's something we plan on rectifying here.' The Bruins have played this season without defenseman Dennis Seidenberg, usually a fixture on the penalty kill, as he recovers from back surgery. And now Kelly is gone. 'There's no doubt we miss guys like (Seidenberg); we're going to miss a guy like Chris Kelly,' Julien said. 'But having said that, we've still got lots of guys who should be able to step up and do the job. We don't want to use that as an excuse.' The Bruins recalled versatile veteran forward Max Talbot after a brief stint at AHL Providence. Talbot has been an effective PK guy in years past with the Penguins and elsewhere. 'You lose Kelly, you lose a good penalty killer,' Julien said. 'We brought in Max Talbot because, No.1, he is a good penalty killer; and No. 2, because he's a veteran and a great leader. He comes and plays hard every night. So somewhere along the way you (have to) find ways to compensate for Kelly's loss, and Max is our answer right now to come in and help us out in that area.  'We have to look at what we have. And what we have should be enough to be a lot better than what we are now.' But the penalty killing woes are probably less about the forwards than the defensemen. With the likes of Patrice Bergeron, Brad Marchand, Loui Eriksson and Talbot, the B's should be OK up front in man-down play. The inexperience on the back end is more of an issue, and there's not much Julien & Co. can do about that right away, other than to wait for their young defensemen to get better.",['ENGLISH'],660,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

43,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Local,DISASTER UPS FEAR OF ISLAMIC STATE TERROR,,OWEN BOSS,"New intelligence reports that an Islamic State affiliate may have brought down the Russian Metrojet airliner over the Sinai Peninsula with a bomb would suggest a new level of sophistication for the terrorist group and raises the prospect other western targets could be next, security experts told the Herald.","'I think that clearly the Islamic State has both the will and the means to commit a mass casualty attack like this against civilians,' Northeastern University terrorism expert Max Abrahms said. 'The fact that the Islamic State could take down a commercial airplane in today's day and age certainly suggests a higher level of capability.' U.S. intelligence agencies are operating under the theory that a bomb exploded on the plane, a U.S. official said yesterday Although analysts have not yet made a definitive determination of what caused the aircraft to crash, officials say investigators are combing through electronic and digital communications intercepted from extremist groups in Egypt and Sinai - including the Islamic State - to see whether a terrorist group played a role. Russian officials say the Airbus A321-200, carrying mostly Russian vacationers home to St. Petersburg, broke up in midair 23 minutes after takeoff. If Islamic State militants are found to be behind the possible bombing, Abrahms says it would indicate the terror group is operating at 'a higher level of capability than many of us had assumed.' No U.S. citizens were aboard the flight, so direct access to the crash site, the flight data and voice recorders and plane parts by U.S. aviation, law enforcement and intelligence agencies has been limited. FBI bomb experts have not been invited to the scene, the official said. British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said yesterday his government concluded there is a 'significant possibility' that a bomb caused the crash. Should the crash be found to be an Islamic State response to increased Russian involvement in the campaign against the barbaric terror group in Syria, the tragedy would end up being a 'be careful what you ask for because you might just get it moment' for Russian President Vladimir Putin, said professor Owen Cote of Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Securities Studies program. 'They wanted to flex their muscles, they wanted to go in, they wanted to make a big show about how they're backing up their ally and then this happens,' Cote said about the Russians. 'It will be very interesting to see what Putin does next.' News agencies reported Monday that a U.S. satellite detected a midair heat flash at the time of the Metrojet fall from radar screens. Russian news media, however, reported from the makeshift forensic lab in St. Petersburg that the bodies of the crash victims bore no signs of an explosive impact. If an Islamic State link is discovered, American travelers should be wary of boarding flights leaving Middle Eastern countries, said Edith Flynn, a terror expert and professor emeritus at Northeastern University. 'Unfortunately getting bombs onto airplanes is still too easy,' she said. 'They will boost security but it is always an uphill battle. The more you improve the more they try to circumvent.

45,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Local,"Dad, son plead guilty in EBT scam",,O'RYAN JOHNSON,Two men who stole as much as $1.5 million in food stamp benefits at their Lawrence bodega reached plea deals with state prosecutors yesterday that will send one away to prison for four to six years. ,"Cristian Pena, 44, pleaded guilty in Essex Superior Court in Salem to money laundering, trafficking in SNAP benefits and larceny over $250. He was sentenced to four to six years in prison at MCI Cedar Junction. The Dominican national will be deported after he does his time, prosecutors said.  His father, Ramone Pena, 66, who worked as a clerk in his son's store, also pleaded guilty to trafficking SNAP benefits and unlicensed possession of a firearm without an FID card. He was sentenced to 18 months' probation. He is a naturalized U.S. citizen. Assistant District Attorney Phil Mallard said between June 2012 and May 2015, the Penas stole between $1 million and $1.5 million in food stamp benefits.  'This particular crime, which puts cash illegally in the hands of the persons who qualify for this program is a means of having addictions facilitated, Judge, is cash that allows them to go obtain drugs and other sort of incidental crimes,' Mallard said. 'This defendant profited personally from the misery that he allowed.'  Mallard said undercover agents with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which funds the food stamp program, visited Bonao Market on Newbury Street in Lawrence. On more than 20 occasions they brought a small item to the counter, such as a Coke. When the customer paid with EBT, the Penas would ring them out for $100. The agent would receive $75 cash, while the Penas kept $25. An 'extensive' investigation into the whereabouts of the money - including searches of bank accounts and safe-deposit boxes - only turned up $40,000, Mallard said. The rest of the money was gone.  'We don't know for sure where, but it is our suspicion that it is out of the country,' said Carrie Kimball-Monihan, a spokeswoman for Essex District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett.",['ENGLISH'],329,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

Burmistrov, whistled for holding and holding the stick penalties, got the puck out of the penalty box late in the third period and took advantage of it. Blake Wheeler joined him to outnumber Jake Gardiner, and Burmistrov scored with 2:05 left on a give-and-go.","Bryan Little added an empty-netter with 26 seconds left. It was a much stronger effort from Winnipeg (8-4-1) after getting crushed by the Canadiens, 5-1, on Sunday. Coach Paul Maurice didn't like his team's game, including his own performance. The bounce-back in Toronto was more than respectable. Defenseman Dustin Byfuglien, cleared by the NHL after a hearing for a hit on Canadiens forward Brendan Gallagher, scored early, and Mark Scheifele also had a goal. Ondrej Pavelec stopped 24-of-26 shots in the first half of back-to-back games. The Jets visit Ottawa tonight. Counterpart James Reimer had another good game in net for the Leafs (2-8-2), making 29 saves. Pierre-Alexandre Parenteau and Leo Komarov scored for Toronto. A defensive miscue by the Leafs allowed the Jets to get on the board 3:41 into the game as a wide-open Mathieu Perreault found Byfuglien, who drove the net and scored his third goal of the season. Toronto tied the score on the power play at 8:22 when a shot attempt by Tyler Bozak deflected off Jets defender Mark Stuart's stick and right to Parenteau at the side of the net. The Jets took the lead back 37 seconds later. With the Leafs unable to get the puck in their own zone, Winnipeg played tic-tac-toe as Scheifele went top shelf over Reimer. The lead lasted until 12:17 into the second period when, on a delayed penalty, Roman Polak carried the puck to the crease, throwing a centring pass in front. The puck banked in off Komarov's skate and in. Elsewhere in the NHL - Edmonton rookie Connor McDavid will be out indefinitely because of a broken left collarbone. He was expected to undergo surgery yesterday, with a recuperation period expected to stretch into months. 'We're talking about months,' Oilers general manager Peter Chiarelli told a news conference. 'We don't have a particular timeframe, but as I said, plural, months. There will be plates and screws involved (in the surgery).' McDavid was injured Tuesday night in the Oilers' 4-2 win against the Philadelphia Flyers. Racing down the left wing toward the Flyers goal late in the second period, with Flyers defenders Brandon Manning and Michael Del Zotto beside him, McDavid appeared to lose the edge on his skate. The trio fell and plowed hard into the end boards. McDavid struggled to his feet and skated slowly to the bench. . . .

Yellen: Dec. rate hike possible Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen said yesterday that an interest rate hike in December is a 'live possibility' if the economy stays on track. Yellen described the U.S. economy as 'performing well' right now, with solid growth in domestic spending. At its Dec. 15-16 meeting, the Fed will consider raising a key interest rate from a record low near zero if the economy continues to grow at a strong enough pace to keep adding jobs and push annual inflation toward the Fed's 2 percent target, Yellen said. She stressed that no decision has been made yet and a move in December will depend on how the economy fares between now and then.

49,"Newspaper, Newspapers",FEATURES,Family,Consider critical components of assisted living,,LYNDA BRISLIN,"When moving a loved one to an assisted living or memory care community, it is most important to focus on the key issues that will meet their individual needs. It is a major decision, and one you will feel confident about once you have done your homework and learned about the choices available to you.  Here is a list of important components to consider:","Well-trained staff   How long has the staff been employed in the community? What is the turnover rate for employees? Is the staff friendly and involved with residents? Residents have challenges when staff frequently leaves and a new employee must learn the nuances of each resident's personality. This is probably one of the most important elements to research when considering your options. High turnover is a symptom of operational issues. Finding a community with tenured employees isn't always easy but it's very important. Quality dining  Dining with fellow residents is one of the highlights of each day. The quality of the meals is extremely important. Make sure you experience a meal in the dining room. Ask if special diets are available. Are low-sodium and low-sugar options always offered to residents? Are family members welcome to share a meal with loved ones? Is the food fresh, appetizing and courteously served with a smile? Socialization  How does the community help new residents get involved? Do new residents have an orientation with staff to acquaint them with who might be supporting them? Is there an identified resident to help show new residents around?   Daily activities  Ask to see the current month's activity calendar, as well as previous ones. Visit a community's Facebook page to see what occurs for social, cultural, recreational and spiritual programs. Residents who are no longer fully independent enjoy and appreciate having a varied and stimulating choice of enrichment programs from which to choose.  Medication control  How are medications dispensed? Does the staff member have appropriate training? Are the medications locked? How are they delivered for added convenience? Is there an additional charge to manage a resident's medications? Housekeeping Learn about the services included or charges for housekeeping. Is residents' personal laundry done for them? Are linens changed weekly, or more often as needed? Does the community provide linens or can residents bring their own favorites? Is the bed made each day? Are the common areas inviting and well kept? Does the community look good, feel good and smell good? Is the community being maintained to the highest standard in order to meet the residents' lifestyle and needs? Transportation What types of transportation are included in the monthly fee? Is there an additional charge to be taken to a medical appointment and if so, how much? What types of vehicles are used? Are they serviced regularly?

We want a quality home with good value and low maintenance so we can focus on having fun with friends and neighbors.","'We chose a custom factory-constructed home at The Landing at Exeter River; it's the best decision we've made in a long time,' homeowners George and Lois said. 'Meeting new friends here at The Landing at Exeter River has been wonderful. It's so nice living in a community where the neighbors are friendly and they really care about each other'. 'Factory-constructed homes are high-quality homes. They are custom designed and constructed using methods that drastically reduce unnecessary expenses, while maintaining quality,' said Lisa Klingelhoefer,  manager of New Hampshire's The Landing at Exeter River. www. - exeterriverlanding.com Some may resist the idea of a 55-plus community, but there are tremendous social benefits to active 55+ living. A 2010 baby boomer survey conducted by Del Webb, the originator of 55-plus communities in America, found that boomers feel 15 years younger than their actual age. More than half exercise regularly. A high percentage feel they are in better shape as they get older, and they feel younger due to their attitudes. Seventy-five percent of buyers say meeting new people is extremely important. For these reasons, and more, the clubhouse at The Landing at Exeter River is the focal point where new friends meet and neighbors congregate for social gatherings.  Low-cost high-tech factory home construction is booming, and boomers are making the smart home choice of downsizing to custom factory-constructed homes located in The Landing at Exeter River.

54,"Newspaper, Newspapers",FEATURES,Lifestyle,How to handle coach berating player,,ALISON BOWEN - CHICAGO TRIBUNE,Your child's soccer coach is berating a player whose parent isn't there. Do you get involved?,"There's a line between 'berating' and trying to push a young player in his or her development. If a coach is being mean or in any way humiliating an athlete, you step in. Abusive behavior is not constructive, and it is not moral. It is also very important to consider at what level the player is competing. If we're talking about a recreational league of players, say, under the age of 10 ... you are trying to stress positives, build self-confidence and teach a love of sport. However, as children grow older and progress, expect the coaching to take a more serious tone. - Nancy Lieberman, assistant coach with the NBA's Sacramento Kings. Club and high school soccer coaches are far more likely to push their players to the limit, since competition is high and college scholarships are on the line. As a general rule, abusive behavior should not be tolerated at any level. If a coach is physically attacking a player, then step in immediately. If a coach is berating a player verbally, report it to the player's parents and discuss whether they should confront the coach or report it to an official. The right thing to do is to let the parents of the player decide how they want to handle it. However, if you continue to see the abuse, you should talk to an official yourself. - Sam Deane Mavis, author of 'Motherland of Sam' and the blog '365 Days in the Motherland of Sam.'",['ENGLISH'],244,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

All that was missing was a win to wash it down.","'It felt good,' Hunter said after making 1-of-2 shots and picking up a steal in playing 13 minutes of the 100-98 loss to the Pacers. 'I felt like my first appearance was a while ago though, so I felt pretty comfortable today. It was just a tough game. 'Everything aside, that's definitely special,' he added of being back in Indy. 'There's no energy like being home. For that first shot to go in here is great, but, again, it's still tough with a loss.' Of hitting his first shot, Hunter said, 'Hey, I thought it was a 3.

'He's doing well,' the coach said at the morning shootaround. 'He hasn't gotten a chance in the games yet, but he's not far from not only getting a chance but being an impactful guy. He's really gotten better on the defensive end, and shooting is a real positive. We'll see if he can impact us sooner rather than later.' Hunter acquired 10 tickets for friends and family. He certainly knew the way to Banker's Life Fieldhouse. 'I've been to countless games, probably over 100,' Hunter said. As for his favorite Pacers player growing up, he said, 'Reggie (Miller), of course, but I think Jermaine O'Neal was a hero. He ran Indy. I would say J.O., because he was killin' there for a while.'

He went and got treatment at 10 or 10:30 at night. He doesn't remember anything happening in the game or in practice. Then (yesterday) morning he tried to do some stuff or get loosened up for shootaround and wasn't able to do it. He still wanted to give it a couple of hours, (but) it didn't get better.' It was uncertain early yesterday whether Avery Bradley (sore right hand) would play, but he went 35 minutes and had 21 points. 'Yeah, he was good,' Stevens said. 'He's always good. He's willing to play through some stuff and that's a good thing. I know that he wishes we would have come out with a win.' Said Bradley of his fingers: 'They're sore. I just didn't worry about it. Especially once I knew Marcus wasn't playing, I know my team needs me and I don't want to miss any games. I just want to go out there and compete every single night.' Butler memories stir Even in his third season with the Celtics after leaving Butler University, coming back  to Indianapolis for a game is still a big deal for Stevens. 'It's great,' he said yesterday morning. 'I got a chance to see one of my former players (Tuesday) night and a couple of friends real briefly, then I stayed in my hotel and worked. 'But it is great to be back, and it's fun, because when I open my window I can see Eli Lilly, where I worked, and I can see Lucas Oil Stadium, where we played (Butler losing to Duke in the 2010 NCAA final). It just brings back a lot of great memories.' The player to whom Stevens referred is former Butler center Andrew Smith, who's been battling cancer. 'He's got a bone marrow transplant (today),' the coach said. 'I've seen Andrew through a lot of really tough stuff over the last two years, and that son of a gun always responds. He's as tough as they come, and I have no doubt that he'll respond again. 'It was funny. He asked about how we're doing. 'Are we coming together? How are we playing?' Like, those are small problems, aren't they - in the big picture?'  D for development Hunter has clearly moved ahead of second-year swingman James Young on the depth chart. Young and rookieJordan Mickey were sent down to Maine on Tuesday, but their D-League visit will be brief. 'You know what?' Stevens said. 'They're having two-a-days and just thought rather than doing a 40-minute shootaround and a 15-to-20-minute shooting session before the game that it would be a lot more beneficial to get three to four hours of hard, good work in a good practice. So that was our thought process. They'll be back with us (tomorrow) or (today) for practice.' . . . Amir Johnson rolled his right ankle in the first half. He was available in the second half but played just 8:24 after the break because, Stevens said, 'I felt like David (Lee) was playing really well.'",['ENGLISH'],824,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

Now, the U.S. Sentencing Commission wants to, over time, let a ridiculous number of drug offenders free early, to ease overcrowding in federal prisons.","The idea is to release  'nonviolent' offenders. What about the fact that drug dealing and trafficking is completely surrounded by violence? If we allow these people back into the real world, there is no good that comes from it. We are in the middle of a despicable drug epidemic, in which naïve teens and irresponsible adults are abusing their freedom by choosing to participate in illegal acts. People are spiraling downwards into heroin addiction - and the release of 6,000, and eventually 46,000 drug offenders will definitely contribute to this. Why should we add to the chaos? Therefore, these federal prisoners should not be released just to save some space in prisons, and save a few bucks. The potential these people have of doing the worst of things to our country is very high, and I would like to think the leaders of the U.S. believe the same. - Julie Young,  - North Berwick, Maine Keep crude in U.S. The U.S. should maintain its ban on exporting crude oil ('ConocoPhillips chief: End ban on crude oil exports,' Oct. 23). We should not be exporting oil - and natural gas for that matter - because these are finite resources. The world's supply of these resources is limited, while demand still continues to increase. Wouldn't it be short-sighted to be selling off our reserves for immediate profit? Wouldn't it be infinitely wiser, for both military and domestic purposes, to conserve these invaluable resources for America's own long-term use? By way of example, some estimates say the U.S. has 100 years' worth of reserves of natural gas, the export of which is not banned. But that won't be true if we keep selling it to offshore buyers. The reserves won't last. Therefore, why not conserve our natural supplies of crude oil and natural gas? - Keevin Geller, Sharon GOP tack is right It seems that in every - election cycle, there is a call for good Republicans to behave more like Democrats. The idea is that Republicans seeking the presidency should lose their 'rigidity' over social/religious issues that supposedly inhibit votes. That's the approach recommended in the Herald op-ed by Megan Meehan Joseph ('Tack to right leaves many voters out,' Oct. 31). But religious themes have historically influenced public policy. Astute Republicans understand the need for public discourse over all issues for determining right and wrong.

60,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,World,"Ahmad Chalabi, conned U.S. into Iraq war",,,"BAGHDAD - Ahmad Chalabi, a prominent Iraqi politician who became a Pentagon favorite when he helped convince the Bush administration to overthrow Saddam Hussein in 2003 by pushing false allegations of weapons of mass destruction and links to al-Qaeda, died Tuesday of a heart attack. He was 71.","Iraqi state TV said he died in Baghdad, but did not provide further details. Mr. Chalabi, a secular Shiite politician who lived in exile for decades, was a leading proponent of the invasion and had close ties to many in the Bush administration, who viewed him as a favorite to lead Iraq. However, he had a falling out with the Pentagon after the invasion, and was largely sidelined by other Iraqi leaders, many with close ties to neighboring Iran. Mr. Chalabi had most recently been serving as the chairman of parliament's finance committee, and was previously a deputy prime minister. To his supporters in Iraq, Mr. Chalabi was a campaigner for democracy who deserves credit for Saddam's removal. 'It is a very bad day for Iraq,' Shiite lawmaker Muwaffak al-Rubaie, a former national security adviser, told The Associated Press. 'He was one of the most seasoned and pioneering politicians. Chalabi worked for a democratic, liberal Iraq ... I am glad he died peacefully.' But Robert Baer, a former CIA officer who met with Mr. Chalabi repeatedly in the mid-1990s and in the lead-up to the 2003 war, called him a 'con man' who was able to manipulate American politicians. 'He was the most charming man I've had to deal with at the CIA and the most educated,' Baer told the AP. 'He understood American politics and he understood the American political narrative better than most Americans.' The scion of a wealthy Baghdad family, Mr. Chalabi fled Iraq as a teenager when the monarchy was overthrown. He earned a bachelor's degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1965, and then earned a Ph.D. in mathematics at the University of Chicago. He became a leading figure in Iraq's exiled opposition in the 1990s and cultivated close ties with the future Vice President Dick Cheney and Washington's so-called neo-conservatives, who favored a more muscular U.S. policy in the Middle East. After the Sept. 11 attacks, Mr. Chalabi played a key role in convincing the administration that the Iraqi government had weapons of mass destruction and ties to al-Qaeda, unfounded claims at the heart of the case for war. 'There are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and Saddam has them, and they are developing them continuously, and I think, if there is a correct way to look for them, they will be found,' Mr. Chalabi told AP television in 2003. After the invasion, Mr. Chalabi was appointed to the 25-member Iraqi governing council and earned a seat directly behind first lady Laura Bush during the 2004 State of the Union. 'He more than any other Iraqi helped get rid of Saddam,' said Sajad Jiyad, a fellow at the Iraqi Institute for Economic Reform in Baghdad. 'He brought together all the opposition parties - Islamists, communists, ex-Baathists, secularists, nationalists.' Mr. Chalabi went on to lead Iraq's de-Baathification Committee, which worked to purge the government of Saddam loyalists, but was mistrusted by the country's Sunnis.             - associated press",['ENGLISH'],542,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

61,"Newspaper, Newspapers",FEATURES,Television-Television Reviews,Let's keep 'Agent X' a secret,,MARK PERIGARD,"'Agent X' might be the first show in which the top-billed star is but a supporting player - and an unnecessary one. Golden Globe-winner Sharon Stone ('Casino') scores the vanity slot for the TNT action drama, but she's not the agent  - she's Vice President Natalie Maccabee, who discovers her new job comes with a secret lair - holy Bat Cave! - and a mission statement.","Turns out that Constitution we've been following all these years? Not the original. The real one features a key phrase lost through the decades that grants the vice president the authority to use a secret agent in times of national crisis. Welcome to 'Mission: Preposterous.' When the daughter of the FBI director (Jamey Sheridan, 'Law & Order: Criminal Intent') is kidnapped, Natalie calls John Case (Jeff Hephner, last seen on NBC's 'Chicago Fire') into action, which gives Stone a reason to look at monitors as much more dynamic characters do interesting things. John seems to be a multi-linguist and master of all martial arts. Playing Alfred to his Batman is Malcolm Millar (Gerald McRaney, 'Deadwood'). John even is pitted against a Catwoman of sorts in contortionist/Russian spy Olga Petrovka (Olga Fonda, 'The Vampire Diaries'). She starts by wanting to kill him and ends up maybe wanting to bed him. International affairs - pun intended - are so complicated. Stone, who serves as executive producer here, has turned in some superb work on TV and won an Emmy for a stint on 'The Practice.' But it's a mystery why she took on this show, which isn't geared to showcase her. Her character could be erased and the show wouldn't miss a beat - heck, it might actually be better. In the second episode, which follows at 10 p.m., her vice president is already marginalized.  Her big moment of the hour comes when she runs interference for John by crashing an FBI tour and teasing a bratty kid that her father is going to be audited. Hephner comes off as a cross between Kevin Costner and a 'Just for Men' model and is adequate handling the light banter the scripts spoon out. This is a Sunday night show for people who find 'The Walking Dead' too grim and 'The Good Wife' too real. Stone can carry something better.",['ENGLISH'],362,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

62,"Newspaper, Newspapers",FEATURES,Travel,Escape plan,Feel like you're thousands of miles away at Seaport's Envoy Hotel,MOIRA McCARTHY,"Escape knows no time zone. Vacation needs no mile marker. This I discovered recently when I planned a near-home getaway that left me completely fulfilled. I saw new sights while walking streets I've known all my life. For a glorious three-day weekend, I was entertained, pampered and submerged completely in vacation mode. All just a few quick miles from home.","I chose to anchor my weekend at the spiffy new Envoy Hotel in Boston's Seaport District. Opened four months ago, the hotel is Boston's first Autograph Collection property. Tucked into the edge of Boston Harbor (it gazes down upon the iconic Barking Crab restaurant), the hotel offers a new and distinctive feel for a Boston stay, but with enough classic Boston and seaside to remind us what an amazing city we live in. There's even a rooftop bar. It was clear from check-in that staff members are delighted to be there - their warmth and expertise was genuine. Warm and almost beachy, and touched with the hotel's signature yellow and lots of reclaimed wood, the lobby featured classic games such as Connect Four, deep and comfortable conversation-pit-style couches, artistic touches like a chandelier made from reclaimed materials, and an open feel. We could see through the vibrant bar and dining room to the active kitchen. Yes, we'd spend some time there. Our room - like all 136 in the hotel - was surprising and innovative, but in a gentle, welcoming way. The first thing that hit my husband and me was the view. The Boston skyline etched by harbor waters is breathtaking. Then there is the decor. It feels airy and on point. The television (which is also an interactive tool for things like check-out, the Internet and Netflix), sits on an easel made from a bike. The bath area is enclosed in glass etched with a map of Boston Harbor. We could have stayed there all weekend if we wanted to. But Boston called us. From our window, we could see the Moakley footbridge, and we planned to walk it. But first, we turned the other way and headed into the Innovation District for a craft beer or two, landing at Committee, where we noshed on Greek appe­tizers and sampled a few local beers recommended by our bartender. Outside the window, construction was everywhere, and fun to watch. Clearly the Innovation District is innovating. It's not hard to remember when this slice of Boston was unsavory. Now it shines. We headed back to our hotel for dinner at the Outlook Kitchen and Bar. Executive chef David Verdo's progressive culinary sense is obvious in each dish. We sampled a bright halibut in a lemongrass broth, and dug into a savory steak and an amazing dessert that features marshmallows that smoke in front of you. Verdo is all about local sourcing and farm to table, and it shows in the fresh taste in each bite. His kitchen - which you can see into - looks bright and calm. Two chef's-area side seats are available for dining each night at no extra cost. You just need to plan ahead and reserve. We closed out the night with one of the bar's signature cocktails. The next morning after noshing on the lobster benedict for breakfast, we walked over the Moakley bridge and explored Boston, a city we've known all our lives. The Envoy is close to everything. We cut through the Financial District, a place I'm used to seeing busy, and noticed things we've probably passed in a rush a million times. A fall garden. Cool fixtures on buildings. The light through the narrow streets lined with tall buildings. In the hush of a Saturday morning, it was a new discovery. Then we turned back and walked all the way along the Rose Kennedy Greenway. We cut over and walked through the arch of the Boston Harbor Hotel, then headed back to the Greenway. There are giant chess sets, frolicking kids, food trucks and more. It's lush and yet urban, an intoxicating mix.  We followed the Green­way to Faneuil Hall and ended up at the new Boston Public Market, where chef Verdo was teaching a cooking class. Offered by the hotel, the class takes you to the market to shop for fresh, local ingredients and then back to the kitchen to prepare them. The market itself is a destination. Cheeses, cider doughnuts, fresh fish and meats, a giant craft beer selection, just about any food you can imagine is there. How have we missed this? We chose Brussels sprouts on a thick stem and briny scallops and headed back to learn how to prepare them. It's a perfect afternoon. That night we ventured out, a quick walk to Downtown Crossing to spend an evening at Yvonne's, newly opened where Locke-Ober stood for more than a century. With some touches from those old days, the place is like three spaces in one. Our favorite section was the library, and not just for the amazing portrait of Bill Murray over the fireplace. It's cozy and alive and the drinks are sublime. Dinner earlier in the outer area featured shared plates of oysters, pork and tuna, as well as some large pour cocktails that serve many. Fun and bonding, that's what dining there is. Sunday we dined at the hotel again, and then headed off to explore some museums. It's a quick drive from the Envoy to home, but it feels as if we'd weekended in another world. We'll escape to the Envoy again, experiencing our own Boston. Innovation indeed.

SWEET,"Prospective jurors - seated last month for the murder trial of Philip Chism, but kept in the dark for weeks about the teen's alleged mental meltdown - will be grilled today about whether they kept their pledge to ignore media coverage of the case.","Their answers to Judge David A. Lowy about any knowledge of Chism's self-inflicted physical abuse, conversations with an imaginary friend and expressed desire to be shot to death by a vigilante - could determine whether Lowy drains the jury pool entirely and starts from scratch. Chism is charged with the 2013 rape and murder of Danvers High School math teacher Colleen Ritzer, 24. Lowy yesterday ruled Chism, 16, competent to assist in his own defense based on a 67-page report filed by Framingham child psychiatrist Dr. Virginia Merritt, who studied him during his court-ordered 20-day commitment at the Worcester Recovery Center. Merritt's findings are impounded. Jurors were originally told the trial would be over by Veterans Day; however, due to the mental evaluation delay, the case could now go to Christmas. State Jury Commissioner Pamela J. Wood said one option available to Lowy if he finds the pool has been tainted by Chism's troubles and the trial's unexpected delay is to take jurors from the pools of other Essex County courts. 'It is unusual,' Wood told the Herald. 'It only happens a handful of times a year.' Chism appeared compliant in court yesterday. He was seen mouthing responses to his defense team's questions, but continued to ignore his mother.

67,"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,Hockey-Bruins,"Talbot rolls with AHL stint, eager to help",,STEPHEN HARRIS - BRUINS NOTEBOOK,"Some NHL veterans with 668 career games and a Stanley Cup under their belt might regard a demotion to the American Hockley League as an insult, an affront to their dignity, a waste of time. Max Talbot took the opposite approach when he was assigned to Providence on Oct. 27, his first AHL stint since 2006-07. Talbot tried to use his week in the minors in the most positive way possible. In three games, he posted four assists and a plus-3 rating. 'I took it as a positive experience for me,' the 31-year-old Talbot said yesterday. 'Obviously it's not something you wish for, but at the same time, I went down there and worked on some different things. I kind of got a little confidence back. It was something good for me.'","He's naturally sad to earn his ticket back to the big club because of the horrific injury suffered by Chris Kelly early in Tuesday's 5-3 loss to Dallas. The 34-year-old Kelly broke his left femur in an awkward fall and underwent surgery yesterday. He's expected to be sidelined 6-8 months. Kelly becomes an unrestricted free agent next July 1, and the injury puts his future in doubt. Talbot will try to provide the same sort of versatility and leadership. 'I'll be myself,' Talbot said. 'I think (Kelly) is the type of player and guy in the room that's irreplaceable. He's a big part of this team. We're definitely thinking about him. It sucks to see those things happen, but for me, I'll just be myself, work hard and bring the leadership I can bring, and yeah, a positive attitude for sure.' Seids along for ride Bruins coach Claude Julien said injured defenseman Dennis Seidenberg, who's working to rebuild the strength in his legs after undergoing back surgery Sept. 24, will accompany the team on this three-game road trip. But he'll be along strictly to practice and is not yet ready to play. Second-year winger David Pastrnak, who suffered a foot bone contusion blocking a shot against Arizona last week, is not on the trip. The Bruins face the Washington Capitals tonight, then have a big game Saturday in Montreal against the first-place Canadiens. The Capitals pulled off a remarkable regular-season sweep of the Bruins in 2014-15, shutting them out in all three meetings with Braden Holtby in goal all three times. The B's trip wraps up Sunday in Brooklyn against the New York Islanders. Goaltending plans remain confidential, but it seems reasonable that Tuukka Rask will face the Caps tonight and then his longtime nemesis, the Canadiens, on Saturday. Jonas Gustavsson likely will try to improve to 4-0-0 with a start against the Islanders at the Barclays Center. Colin coming along Julien talked about hard-shooting 23-year-old defenseman Colin Miller, who has played well in his first NHL season. Miller has a goal, four assists and a plus-4 rating in 10 games. His first NHL goal came in Tuesday night's loss against Dallas on a shot from the point. 'He's a young player, an extremely young player who I think has been getting better with confidence,' the coach said. 'He shot the puck well (Tuesday) with that goal. That was the kind of shot we've gotten to know (with him), the power behind the shot. It was nice that he hit the mark and got a big goal. Hopefully that's another nice confidence boost for a young player that will help him get better. But I think he's been improving. 'He's not the biggest defenseman (6-foot-1, 196 pounds), but he certainly battles hard,' Julien added. 'He's not afraid to go in the corners, he's not afraid to get his nose dirty. He's one of those young players we're willing to grow with and help get better. We're still allowing him to grow in a (role) where he doesn't have to face all the top players. He might for a shift or two, but that's not the plan.'",['ENGLISH'],620,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

We learned an explosive device could have taken down the Russian jet found in the Sinai Peninsula Saturday, killing all 224 people on board - including children. ","If terrorists are ultimately to blame, it's one of our worst fears come true. What we do know is that if ISIS can blow up a Russian passenger plane, they can do it to us.  They can also wreak havoc on our domestic subway trains or commuter rails that have virtually no security and are highly vulnerable to a terror attack.  Amtrak and other U.S. train providers are officially on notice.  In addition to U.S. airlines, security must also be ramped up on all cargo before it's too late - cargo in trains and in our ports.  At this point it's time the president stopped taking selfies and renaming mountains. As commander in chief, he has a duty to take the radical Islamist threat seriously and implement real measures to combat it, not symbolic ones.  Since the U.S. airstrikes began in Iraq over a year ago, President Obama still doesn't have a military strategy to defeat ISIS. What kind of message does that send to foreign enemies worldwide - including the Islamic State?  Incompetence? Or weakness?  Take your pick.  Over a year into this so called 'coalition' war with ISIS, it's ridiculous the leader of the free world has no viable plan of action, other than mostly ineffective airstrikes and blowing over $500 million of our tax dollars to train 50 moderate 'rebels' - which has been a complete bust.  Any of the Republican presidential contenders would have had a strategy by now if they were in Obama's seat. Especially given the fact that ISIS has already released videos threatening to attack America and raise the black jihadi flag at the White House.  If you think that scenario is far-fetched, you've forgotten 9/11, where al-Qaeda hijacked Flight 93 - headed for either the Capitol or the White House. If it weren't for the brave heroes onboard who rushed the cockpit and diverted the plane, radical Islamist terrorists could've hit all four targets they were aiming for that fateful day.  With a weak president and secretary of state, coupled with radical extremists on the march, we're sitting ducks for another terrorist attack.  It's just a matter of time.

70,"Newspaper, Newspapers",OPINION,Editorials,Finding the truth in Sinai,,,"The crash of a Russian jetliner and the loss of 224 souls on board was, of course, tragic, but today it is a tragedy compounded by disinformation campaigns by those who have the most to lose.","And so it was not surprising yesterday when British officials raised the likelihood of a bomb on board and Prime Minister David Cameron's office dispatched aviation experts to the crash site near Sharm el-Sheikh to assess security before any British flights would be allowed to leave the resort area. U.S. officials, who had already reported that satellite imagery detected a large flash of light at the time the plane broke apart, were also inclined to attribute it to a bomb. The revelations followed days of butt-covering first by the Russian airline Metrojet, which insisted it could not possibly have been pilot error or a technical malfunction - the plane's advanced age and a previously damaged tail section notwithstanding. Why? Well, because they said so. Russian government officials have said it was too early to rule that out, but the official government news agency said recordings of the flight crew four minutes before the plane disappeared off radar screen were normal. That contradicts earlier reports that the pilot had requested permission to make an unscheduled landing in Cairo. Russia, not exactly a model of transparency, certainly wanted to tamp down any speculation that this was a terrorist incident related to its recent incursion into Syria. Then, of course, there was Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi who dismissed as 'propaganda' claims of responsibility by the Islamic State, insisting they wanted to harm Egypt's 'image' and security.

O'Brien, 39, was charged yesterday with one count of murder and one count of unarmed assault and battery in connection with the Sept. 16 death of Robert McKenna of Marshfield. Assistant District Attorney Nathaniel Kennedy said cops linked O'Brien to James Ferguson, arraigned last month on murder charges, through cellphone records.  O'Brien initially denied any involvement in McKenna's murder but later admitted to being present at the time of the slaying, Kennedy said. O'Brien is the fourth person to be arrested in the killing. Quincy attorney Michael Moscaritolo faces murder and burglary charges. His girlfriend Lauren Kalil is charged as an accessory after the fact. Police zeroed in on O'Brien off a Home Depot receipt found in Ferguson's Dorchester home, Kennedy said. Surveillance video from the South Boston Home Depot showed an Isuzu Rodeo registered to O'Brien's father. A search of the SUV turned up four guns linked to McKenna, Kennedy said. Witnesses told police O'Brien had been asking people in his neighborhood whether anyone wanted or knew someone who wanted to buy the guns. O'Brien was wearing Air Force 1 sneakers at the time of his questioning, which matched prints at the bloody crime scene, Kennedy said. McKenna was found dead in his Marshfield home by a friend on Sept. 16, the victim of an apparent robbery.

'The immediate aftermath was just unbelievable. To think that if it had gone a little further in, it would have hit me in the face was just - wow. I couldn't  - believe what happened.' Field said she was heading north on Interstate 91 around 11 a.m. on her way to the community theater program in Chicopee where she volunteers as a costume-maker, when a box truck in the middle lane hit a large wooden post, 'sending it up into the air and right through my windshield.' 'There's glass all through the backseat of my car. I was covered in little specks of glass,' Field said just after the horrifying accident that state police warned 'could have had a fatal outcome.' 'It's amazing,' Field said as she waited for her damaged Subaru Forester to be repaired. 'I have the teeniest little scratch on my hand and that's it. It could have been a lot worse.' Field said a cellphone photo she snapped shortly after the  - incident - showing how close the splintered post came to crushing her face - really drove home how fortunate she was to be alive. 'People who were behind me stopped to see if I was all right and they said, 'Should we call the paramedics?' And I looked around and said, 'Well, no, I'm not really hurt,'' Field recalled. 'It's unbelievable. It ended up about even with the steering wheel, but it didn't hit me.'  State police spokesman David Procopio was quick to point out that 'damage caused by debris in the roadway as extreme as (yesterday's) incident is, thankfully, not common.'  But he stressed the accident should serve as a reminder to truck drivers to properly secure their loads. 'What unfortunately is more common is the problem of un-secured loads on the back of commercial and contractor trucks,' Procopio said.  'As many drivers can attest, it's not uncommon to see tools or material on trucks that do not seem properly tied down. The load can become a projectile and cause a tragedy.' In an effort to prevent fatal, - projectile-related crashes, Pro - copio said the state police 'Truck Team,' as one of its  - priority missions, regularly  - enforces secured-load laws. 'We would like to remind contractors and commercial drivers of their requirement to secure all tools, materials, and product they are carrying,' Procopio said, adding, 'The driver of that car was truly blessed  - today to escape without serious injury.' Investigators are urging anyone who may have been driving in the area at the time and saw a truck drop a block of wood 'similar to a post people have holding up their decks or porches' to call state police at 508-820-2121.",['ENGLISH'],486,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

75,"Newspaper, Newspapers",OPINION,Commentary,"Prez muddles about in Syria, Iraq","Use of special forces may help, or amount to little",PETER BROOKES,"There's a lot of confusion about the announcement by the White House late last week about the upcoming deployment of U.S. special operations forces to Syria, especially after President Obama repeatedly promised - going back to 2013 - no 'boots on the ground.' If you're perplexed by the news, don't feel bad, there's no shortage of people who are mystified by Team Obama's 'strategy' - and I use that word cautiously - in the Syria-Iraq theater of operations.","But let's take a minute here to take in what the White House is saying about the deployment before we pass judgment on the decision. First, this is part of the new approach that the Pentagon announced a week ago in a congressional hearing. (See my Oct. 29 Boston Herald column, 'At last, Obama ups game in Mideast wars.') The purpose of the deployment of 50 special ops forces to Syria supposedly  is to 'train, advise and assist' anti-Islamic State (aka ISIS) groups in their mission - an effort that so far has broadly stagnated, creating a stalemate. Our forces reportedly will work directly with Syrian Arab, Kurdish and other militias to improve their fighting capabilities against ISIS, especially with an eye toward putting pressure directly on the caliphate's 'capital,' Raqqa. The U.S. troops will be deployed on a 60-day rotational basis from camps in Kurdish areas in Iraq to an anti-ISIS coalition 'headquarters' in Kurdish areas in Syria, according to press accounts. While U.S. forces won't be on the front lines, they will, of course, be in harm's way. They'll defend themselves and, undoubtedly, will have U.S. firepower just a radio call away - from the likes of A-10 'Warthog' attack aircraft deployed to Turkey. Of course, the big question is: Will these special operations forces boots on the ground make a difference in the ongoing conflict? Despite the 'awesomeness' of our troops, the answer is 'no' in the short-term, but 'maybe' in the longer term. First, when our guys arrive within the next month or so, they'll be gathering information on the ground. U.S. 'eyes and ears on the problem' could help Team Obama's decision makers to formulate policy, which so far has been generally lackluster.  Plus, coaching, training and informing anti-ISIS forces on how to rock Raqqa and other targets could be beneficial. Strikes on the Islamic State capital could wipe out leadership and force its foot soldiers back from across the Islamist 'empire' to defend the city. Attacks could also be a bone-crunching body blow - psychologically to ISIS with its internal and external audiences, possibly knocking it to its knees as well as knocking out perceptions of its invincibility and long-term viability.  You can't help but wonder why we've waited so long to do this. But while it's a new measure, it's also a limited one, in a less-than-comprehensive White House Syria game plan that once again depends largely on the will, abilities and efforts of little-understood outside groups to advance American interests.  (Like the Pentagon's ill-fated Syrian rebel training program.) Indeed, the potential outcome of this special forces mission could be as little as the realization that this anti-ISIS coalition can't roll Raqqa, which while informative, leaves us little better off than we were before in efforts aimed as defeating the Islamic State - a presidential priority.

76,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Local,KIDS GRILL JEB - ON IMMIGRATION,Bush weathers tough forum,CHRIS VILLANI,"MANCHESTER, N.H. - Curious kids didn't give Jeb Bush a break yesterday, as they took him on over sibling rivalry, immigration and presidential pedigree.  'What are you going to do about anchor babies?' a Founders Academy charter school student, who appeared to be about 11 years old, asked the former Florida governor, who is in the Granite State for a three-day campaign swing.","'Anchor babies? Wow, why are you interested in that? I'm curious.' Bush said. 'I believe the babies are attaching illegal immigrants to America, and I was just wondering how are we going to fix this problem?' the student responded. Bush said anyone born in America is an American citizen. 'That's protected by the 14th Amendment to our Constitution. And it should be supported. We just need to make sure we enforce existing laws.' Other children were also interested in Bush's immigration stance - often criticized by his GOP rivals as too moderate. 'My mom wants to know what you are going to do to protect our nation's borders,' a young girl asked. 'Protect the borders, plain and simple,' Bush replied. 'Create a strategy to make sure people can't just walk across the border. Part of that is fencing, part of that is having 20,000 border patrol agents ... part of that is using GPS technology. Think about it, you have GPS technology on your phone, right?' 'What's a border?' an even younger girl inquired as a follow-up. Bush explained that the border separates countries, highlighting the fact that there are both legal and illegal ways to cross the borders. 'We need to make sure people crossing illegally don't do it,' he said. The questions got no easier from there. 'Are you going to follow the lead of your two brothers?' asked another small boy, referring to Bush's older brother and father - former presidents. 'My two brothers? Marvin and Neal?' Bush replied, tongue-in-cheek. 'I love my brothers, but I am who I am.' Another question that stumped Bush momentarily came from a girl who asked, 'What's one thing you wouldn't change?' Bush said he would keep some elements of Obamacare - such as insurance for people with pre-existing conditions or keeping children on their parents' health insurance until age 26 - while repealing the act as a whole.

77,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Local,Newcomers split on taking pay raise,,MARIE SZANISZLO,One of two women who unseated the City Council's longest-serving members at Tuesday night's election said she will not accept the 14-percent pay raise councilors gave themselves.,"High school teacher and small-business owner Annissa Essaibi-George, who beat Stephen J. Murphy in the race for the at-large seat he has held for 18 years, said she will forgo the raise the council approved by a vote of 9-4 last week, hiking their pay from $87,500 to $99,500.  'I'd like to see that money support some important programming,' said Essaibi-George, 41, although she has not yet decided which programs. Andrea Campbell, the 33-year-old lawyer who defeated Charles C. Yancey in District 4, said she will accept the pay raise, although she would have voted against it and would like to explore tying future raises to the city's median household income - as Councilors Matt O'Malley and Ayanna Pressley have proposed - or having an independent body set them. Murphy voted in favor of the raise, whereas Yancey, who has represented parts of Dorchester, Mattapan, Roslindale and Jamaica Plain since his seat was created 32 years ago, voted against it. As of early yesterday evening, Campbell and Essaibi-George said they had received calls and messages of congratulations from several of their future colleagues but had yet to hear from the men they unseated. Their election will double the number of women on the 13-member council when they take office in January - a clear message, they said, that voters wanted more diversity among their elected officials. 'We're not quite there yet, but we're getting close,' said Campbell, who will be one of only three blacks on the council in a city where the majority of residents are women and minorities. 'When you look at the demographics of the council, it doesn't reflect the demographics of the city. ... Voters in District 4 think it's time we make room for the next generation to serve.' Both Campbell and Essaibi-George said they were undecided about Councilor Frank Baker's proposal to change the terms of office for city councilors from two years to four to coincide with mayoral elections.",['ENGLISH'],353,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

78,"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,High School,Simmons leading with her heart,,DAN VENTURA,"MEDWAY - Shannon Simmons is one of the premier high school soccer players in New England, but her presence can be felt far beyond the pitch. Never has that been more evident than this past weekend.","Simmons' friend, Madeline Lamson, was killed in a car accident late Friday night in Franklin, devastating the closely knit community. As one of the leaders in the school, Simmons was pressed into a role no teenager should have to deal with this soon in life. 'It's definitely been tough for me because she was one of my closest friends,' said Simmons, who serves as a peer counselor and also on the school's athletic advisory committee. 'It's been nice to see everyone in the community come together for such a special person. It's been hard but we are getting through it together.' Medway coach Jason Rojee isn't surprised by the leadership Simmons has taken on. He thought when Simmons arrived as a freshman she wasn't your ordinary ninth grader. 'I knew from the first second she walked on the field. She just carried herself in a mature way,' Rojee said. 'She's the type of kid who works hard and never takes anything for granted. She's an incredible role model.' The effort carries over onto the field. A three-time Tri-Valley League all-star and reigning MVP, she was named all-New England by the Eastern Mass. Girls Soccer Coaches Association last year after scoring 24 goals and 13 assists. Simmons gave a verbal commitment early last year to UConn, currently the 10th-ranked team in the country. The decision was not a difficult one. 'I loved the coaches and the school isn't too close to home, but close enough so that my parents can come visit,' Simmons said. 'The first time I went there, I just fell in love with the school. Committing that early has made things less stressful for me now.' Simmons would like nothing more than to leave Medway in a blaze of glory. Since becoming a part of the program, the Mustangs are 57-13-10 and have crept closer to the title in each of the three years. Last year, Medway advanced to the Division 3 South final before losing to Dedham, 2-1, on penalty kicks. This year's team went 14-1-3, won its third straight TVL title, and earned the top seed in Div. 3 South. Simmons believes the Mustangs are ready, willing and able to take the next step. 'Everyone is motivated, no one has to push anyone else,' said Simmons, who recently eclipsed the 100-point plateau. 'They want it just as bad as I do. Everyone works hard.'

The Heat have ruled Green out for tonight's game, citing illness, the same reason given when he sat out Tuesday's home game with Atlanta. The circumstances surrounding his trip to the hospital were a mystery. The former Celtic was admitted yesterday morning, and Miami television station WSVN showed video of Heat guard Mario Chalmers walking outside Jackson Memorial Hospital with a police officer in the afternoon. Miami police said there isn't any ongoing investigation of Green, referring media to Miami-Dade Fire Rescue for more information. Fire rescue officials said privacy laws prohibited them from revealing whether they transported Green. But the Miami Herald reported that police call logs show officers were summoned to the Marquis Residences Condominium at 10:46 a.m. because of a 'male down.' According to a Miami Herald source, Fire Rescue requested assistance because of a 'combative patient' at the address where Green lives. Multiple witnesses at the condo told TMZ that Green 'was acting strange in the lobby of the condo' and 'screaming at the top of his lungs.'  . . .

80,"Newspaper, Newspapers",BUSINESS,BusinessMarkets,MBTA preps for winter storms,Commuter rail gets $8.6M in snow equipment,JORDAN GRAHAM,"Transit officials are vowing to keep tracks clear and trains running when the snow starts flying, buying millions of dollars worth of new equipment and putting a new snow plan in place to avoid a repeat of last year's disastrous winter on the commuter rail.","'Last year we were overwhelmed by a number of large storms in a relatively short period of time,' said Frank DePaola, MBTA general manager, at an event yesterday to show off new snow-clearing equipment. 'We feel, with this equipment, we'll be able to manage that volume of winter precipitation and keep our system running.' The MBTA has bought $8.6 million worth of equipment to clear snow from commuter rail tracks and stations, including small tractors and larger heavy-duty vehicles built specifically to sweep snow off the rails.  That money is coming out of the $83.7 million MBTA winter resiliency budget unveiled by Gov. Charlie Baker earlier this year. Keolis, the firm that operates the commuter rail, said it created a four-level categorization system, and will mobilize resources accordingly.  The company will also add a new passenger information center and a weather desk, and has started training non-maintenance employees to perform snow-­related duties. 'There's not a day that goes by that we don't think about snow,' said Gerald Francis, Keolis' general manager. Still, the majority of the most effective equipment - heavy-duty machines called Snow Fighters - are not due to be delivered until mid-December at the earliest. DePaola said he was 'a little bit' worried about snow coming before the Snow Fighters arrive, but said he believes the agency will be able to handle an early storm. 'Normally when we have snowstorms in the November/December timeframes, it's a single event,' he said. The Snow Fighters are mammoth, yellow rail-riding beasts with a plow on one end and a snow thrower on the other, along with two other plows that extend out from the sides. The MBTA ordered 10 at a cost of $428,000 each, but only one has been delivered. The MBTA is hoping to prove it can function during snowstorms after last winter, when snow forced the entire transit system to shut down, stranding passengers.  Already this year, one commuter rail train was canceled after frost and leaves on the rails combined to make tracks too slippery.",['ENGLISH'],383,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

Keeping that spirit thriving at home was on display at last night's 'Leave No One Behind' gala at the Seaport Hotel.","Nobody exemplifies this more than Tommy Lyons of the Vietnam Veterans Committee, who was honored at the event for his tireless push to find housing and shelter for homeless veterans in Boston. The city has been singled out nationally as being a leader in assisting our deserving combat military - from aging Vietnam vets to those recently back from Iraq and Afghanistan. Boston has been fortunate to have such strong advocates as Tommy.  Many of these veterans suffered from PTSD and mental health effects after serving multiple tours of duty. When I was first elected mayor of Boston in 1984, seeing all the homeless veterans on our city streets and sleeping outside in freezing weather in downtown stores, it was obvious that something had to be done immediately.  We developed a partnership between homeless advocates, churches, businesses, unions and the city to make shelter for the homeless - and especially our veterans - a top priority. Tommy Lyons became the city's point person and we teamed up with several groups and then-U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy II to build the Veterans Shelter on Court Street.  As we vowed back then, 'no person will go without a warm bed, a hot meal, health care and training for a job.' We lived up to that promise.  Today, political leaders like state Rep. Hank Naughton of Clinton, state Rep. Nick Collins of Boston and Boston City Councilor Mike Flaherty continue that fight. I told the people last night that I deeply respect the continued hard work of our homeless veterans advocates, who quietly labor to help these needy people. This group includes Dan Magoon of Wounded Warriors, Eddie Flynn of the DAV, John Mullin of the Fitzgerald Post, Jerry Turner, U.S. Rep. Steve Lynch, Mayor Marty Walsh and Gov. Charlie Baker, who all value the service of our veterans.  We are fortunate to have such committed officials. This Veterans Day, let us all be reminded - as I saw last night in this special tribute to Tommy Lyons - that we owe a life of respect and dignity to all those veterans who defended our freedom and some who paid the ultimate price for our great nation.  Thanks, Commissioner Lyons, and thanks to all our U.S. military veterans.  Nobody should ever be left behind! Raymond L. Flynn is a former mayor of Boston and former U.S. ambassador to the Vatican.

83,"Newspaper, Newspapers",OPINION,Commentary,High court should take up crucial free speech case,,GEORGE F. WILL,"WASHINGTON - The IRS scandal - the denial of essential tax-exempt status to conservative advocacy groups, thereby effectively suppressing the groups' activities - demonstrates this: When government is empowered to regulate advocacy, it will be tempted to suppress some of it. And sometimes government will think like Oscar Wilde: 'The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.' These truths should be on the Supreme Court's nine fine minds on Friday when they consider whether to hear a challenge to a lower court's decision that disregards some clear Supreme Court pronouncements pertaining to the First Amendment. The amendment says there shall be no laws abridging freedom of speech, but various governments are persistently trying to regulate, and perhaps chill, advocacy. The most recent wrinkle in this disreputable project comes from California.","There the Democratic attorney general has decreed that all entities wishing to solicit tax-deductible contributions in California must disclose their donors to the state government. One such entity - unfortunately for the attorney general, but fortunately for the cause of freedom - is the Center for Competitive Politics. Its litigators are tenacious opponents of government attempts to appoint itself regulator of the marketplace of ideas. The CCP asked the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for protection from the attorney general's decree. The appeals court sided with California's attorney general, so the CCP is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse the 9th circuit and rebuke California's attorney general. Doing so, the Supreme Court would be defending a doctrine adumbrated in decisions over six decades. In the 1950s, when the civil rights movement was surging, an Alabama court, pursuant to a state law requiring corporations doing business in the state to produce certain information, ordered the state chapter of the NAACP to produce, among other things, its membership lists. In 1958, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the NAACP's refusal, arguing that forced disclosure would serve no compelling state interest and would deter civil rights supporters from exercising their constitutional rights of free speech and association. The 1958 ruling was not, as California's attorney general suggests, limited to the circumstances of that time and place. And the NAACP ruling did not establish, as the 9th circuit believes, that governments can compel disclosure of donors' participation unless the advocacy group (and charity and educational organization) can demonstrate the probability of threats or reprisals. This would leave governments with effectively unlimited power to intrude into the conduct of private associations. Actually, from the NAACP and subsequent decisions has come the principle that compelled disclosure is an inherent injury to First Amendment rights. Therefore governments bear the burden of proving, under exacting judicial scrutiny, that compelled disclosure is a narrowly tailored response to a specific and paramount government interest. Because California's attorney general does not acknowledge this burden, she has not even attempted to demonstrate how compelled disclosure of donors serves any plausible law enforcement interest. Instead, she misreads cases concerning the source of so much First Amendment mischief - campaign finance regulations. From these, and with the 9th circuit's approval, she conjures government's power to demand, upon the invocation of an unspecified law enforcement interest, disclosure of donors to non-candidate private associations wishing to solicit contributions. This is especially pernicious because it comes in the following context: For almost eight decades, courts, without justification from the Constitution's text or history, have been distinguishing between 'fundamental' rights, such as speech and association, and supposedly lesser rights involving economic activity, property and contracts. When judging government infringements of these secondary rights, courts have adopted the extremely permissive 'rational basis' test: Any government regulation is permissible if the government asserts, or a court can imagine, a rational basis for the regulation. Now, California's attorney general implicitly wants the rational basis test extended to government's infringement of rights to which courts have ascribed 'fundamental' status - speech and association. This demonstrates three converging dangers. One is that of relegating some rights to inferior status. A second is that of making those supposedly non-fundamental rights vulnerable to the non-protection of the rational basis test. A third is that of allowing government, when it claims to be acting to prevent corruption or the appearance thereof, to merely assert a rational basis for regulating advocacy concerning public affairs. By accepting the CCP's appeal, the Supreme Court can stand athwart this confluence of sinister trends. And it can achieve this large good by doing something modest - by reminding the 9th circuit of a redundantly affirmed constitutional principle. George Will is a syndicated columnist.

88,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Local,Women make history in Hub and the state,,Joyce Ferriabough Bolling,"The post-election story in the media was how two veteran Boston city councilors lost their seats to newcomers. In with the new, out with the old. It was a bittersweet moment to see Charles Yancey leave office, because he has been a soldier for his community and a legendary institution-builder. He fought to build the B2 police substation, which helped put a dent in crime. And the Mattapan Library he championed is one of the most beautiful in the city.","But there was another important story: Boston's municipal elections were, quite literally, a history-making mother lode.  All the women the Massachusetts Women's Political Caucus worked to elect to the City Council won: Ayanna Pressley, Michelle Wu, Annissa Essaibi-George and Andrea Campbell. That doubled the number of women on the council, creating a healthy voting bloc.  MWPC also endorsed the new mayor of Medford, Stephanie Burke, only the second woman to be elected mayor in that city. And Nina Liang became the first Asian-American woman elected to the Quincy City Council.  The fact that three of the four women elected to the Boston City Council are of color is also welcome news to Women's Pipeline for Change. That group recently released a publication, in collaboration with UMass's Center for Women in Politics and Public Policy, lamenting the fact that fewer than 100 women of color have been elected to office in Massachusetts history.  Another reason to cheer: Pressley, who just 10 years ago became the first woman of color ever elected to the council, has been the city's top vote-getter for three terms running.   Now much is expected of Campbell, whose life story is one of triumph over adversity and who as an attorney brings a wealth of knowledge to the job. The same goes for Essaibi-George who, as a teacher and a small-business owner, also boasts a life experience that makes her a leader to watch. Yet, while the election results are inspirational, there are still many obstacles to overcome.   For starters, there has never been a popularly elected woman governor in this state, and there is only one mayor of color, Lisa Wong of Fitchburg, who leaves office in January. No Bay State woman of color has ever been elected to Congress or to the U.S. Senate.  Sadly, the number of female elected officials is vastly out of sync with our population. That sends a poor message about the value of gender and diversity, to say nothing of the kind of sensitivity to discourse and lawmaking only women can contribute.

89,"Newspaper, Newspapers",OPINION,Editorials,A mayor in reverse,,,Boston Mayor Marty Walsh has learned the hard way what happens when you put the cart before the horse - or when you put the race cars before the interests of the city as a whole.,"Walsh, the city's top cheerleader for a planned IndyCar race in the Seaport district next September, is downshifting quickly as publicity surrounding the event has turned negative. As the Herald reported yesterday, the mayor and his team are working with race organizers to renegotiate the terms of an agreement signed last May which, as written, could leave taxpayers on the hook for covering some race-related costs. The changes would require Boston Grand Prix to pay for all municipal services associated with the race. How on earth that wasn't part of the agreement from the beginning, well, who knows since it was all discussed out of public view. Earlier this week we learned Walsh has also given Boston Grand Prix a two-week deadline to nail down agreements with other public agencies that would have a role in staging the race, after the Herald reported those negotiations were tied up in a tangle of potentially costly loose ends. Race organizers agreed not to begin ticket sales until those issue were resolved. Of course, this attempt at course correction only came after details on the race and the agreement began to trickle out. It was enough to suggest public officials hadn't learned a damn thing from the whole 'Boston 2024' debacle. True, Walsh signed the IndyCar agreement back in May, before the city's ill-fated Olympic bid crumbled under similar scrutiny. But until this week the mayor and his team were projecting an all-too-familiar 'move along - nothing to see here' attitude. Walsh and race organizers may yet be able to pull off this event, and assuming the deal is reworked to the benefit of the taxpayers that would indeed be a good thing. But we're sorry to say that when it comes to balancing the taxpayers' interests with the chance to play host to a big-time sporting event Walsh is 0-for-2. Strike three is not an option.",['ENGLISH'],337,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

90,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Local,Fentanyl OD data lagging - in Bay State,,MATT STOUT,"As the tide of fentanyl grows in Massachusetts to near nation-leading levels, state officials say they can't track how many fatal overdoses are actually tied to the powerful painkiller - even though other states do.","The information gap comes as federal officials said last week the Bay State saw the second-highest number of fentanyl drug seizures in all of the country last year, only behind Ohio. But officials in that state, as well as Maryland (fourth in fentanyl seizures), Florida (eighth) and neighboring New Hampshire (ninth) are all among those who have provided detailed data on fentanyl-related overdoses. 'Our coroners list all of the drugs attributed to that person's death on the death certificate,' said Melanie Amato, spokes-woman for the Ohio Department of Health, who explained that when fentanyl is included, officials put it toward their count of related deaths. Officials counted 514 alone in 2014 after finding  - just 92 the year before, according to the Centers for Disease  - Control and Prevention. Other states saw similar spikes, including in Maryland, where  - fentanyl-related deaths jumped from 58 in 2013 to 185 last year. Florida saw its numbers jump from 185 to 397, according to last week's CDC alert. Massachusetts officials have estimated that more than 1,200 people died of opiate overdoses in 2014, and preliminary data shows that another 680 died in the first six months of this year.  - Officials have repeatedly pointed to anecdotal cases where heroin is suspected of being laced with a deadly dose of fentanyl, which is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. State Department of Public Health officials, however, say they don't have an official tally. Why they don't is complicated. Public Health Commissioner Monica Bharel initially said yesterday that it's difficult to pick out fentanyl from heroin or other opiates in testing because they 'break down to the same end-product.' But medical professionals challenged her explanation.  Dr. Daniel Alford, an assistant dean at the Boston University School of Medicine, said because fentanyl is a synthetic drug, 'it will never turn a test positive for an opiate. ... Fentanyl is going to test out in a unique way.' Dr. Thomas Andrew, New Hampshire's chief medical  - examiner, said the Pennsylvania-based lab that performs the bulk of his state's toxicology reports will break down the 'individual elements, as opposed to a broad class of drugs.'  In New Hampshire, more than 140 fatal overdoses were related to fentanyl last year, or roughly 44 percent of all fatal over- - doses. Asked to clarify, Bharel sent a statement through a spokesman that said 'testing for opiates is a complex issue' and noted that it's the state's medical examiner's  - office that performs the toxicology tests and reports out the  - results. She added: 'We are constantly - looking to improve our data  - collection and reporting, includ- - ing for fentanyl and other  - synthetics.'",['ENGLISH'],491,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

91,"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,Basketball-Celtics,Slow start angers Celts,In need of quick fix after falling to 1-3,STEVE BULPETT,"INDIANAPOLIS - The Celtics have dropped three straight games after a season-opening victory over Philadelphia, and perspective dictates that shouldn't be cause for much alarm at this point. But the 'it's still early' line of reasoning was clearly wearing thin in their dressing room after last night's 100-98 loss to the Pacers. The Celts sounded like some angry talk-show callers after Avery Bradley nearly stole this one for them at the end. 'I don't know what it is, but we've got to figure it out sooner than later,' said Isaiah Thomas, who started for the injured Marcus Smart and went for a game-high 27 points. 'I'm tired of losing.","'Something's got to change. I don't know what it is, but this was not expected. We're not going to panic, but at the same time, changes need to be made and we need to, as players, take accountability and responsibility of these losses and fix it. 'I think we played solid, but solid isn't good enough. On the offensive end, we played pretty well. We just kept trading baskets. When you trade baskets in this league, you're not going to win a lot of games. We've just got to fix some things, and hopefully we can do that fast.' The Celts were down by five after Paul George's fifth 3-pointer of the game and a Jordan Hill jumper, but Bradley took care of that on the Celts' next two trips, nailing a trey and a 19-footer to tie the game with 1:05 left. George and Thomas missed jumpers on the ensuing possessions, and Bradley sent Monta Ellis to the line, where he hit two free throws with 13.7 on the clock. The Celts then worked the ball to Bradley, but his contested 3-pointer merely grazed the front of the rim. The clock drained on the rebound. The Celts didn't get what they wanted on the play. 'No, they were really physical and did a great job of knocking us off our cuts,' coach Brad Stevens said, 'and so we didn't catch it where we wanted to catch it with Isaiah. As a result, we were pushed too far out. We got a look and actually probably ended up having a chance to make a play there out of nothing a little bit. But they did a really good job defending.' The coach said he wasn't looking for a 3-pointer. 'We had a bunch of options with an action,' he said. 'We just never got it to the point where we could run what we wanted to run.' Bradley credited the Pacers. 'To be honest, they just played great defense,' he said. 'They got us out of the play. I tried to get a shot up there last minute, and unfortunately George Hill played great defense. He got his hand on it. I think it hit the front of the rim, so it probably would have went in if he didn't block it.' So ended a strange night on which the Celtics' best shot wasn't a shot. Jae Crowder tried to inbound the ball the length of the court with 1.1 seconds left in the first half, but his pass to Jared Sullinger instead went off the glass and through the strings, much to the delight of those charged with putting together wacky highlight packages. That may have been the last time the Celtics smiled. The winning team shot just 38.5 percent from the floor, but that didn't matter to the Pacers because they were able to track down 21 offensive rebounds and turn them into a whopping 24-11 edge in second-chance points. The more amazing number is that the Celtics lost by just two points. They reached deep in this one. At one point in the fourth quarter, they were running with a lineup of Thomas, Evan Turner, Lee, Jonas Jerebko and, making his first NBA appearance, R.J. Hunter. That group had some success, leading to a tight race to the finish. Way back at the start, Stevens changed three of the five names in the lineup, but he couldn't replace the first quarter trouble. After the initial quintet stumbled from the gate in the first three games, the coach was hoping a move to Amir Johnson and Sullinger - in place of Lee and Tyler Zeller - would create more flow. Alas, things were even worse  in the first period here. The starters went 5-for-13 from the floor, with a string of seven straight misses leading to an overall 5-for-19 start. The Celtics scored just five points in the quarter's last 6:45, two coming on a Turner drive with 3.9 seconds left that cut the Indiana lead to 23-16. That group was better in the second half, but it wasn't enough. 'I don't feel like we brought it in the first half, and I don't want to continue this bad habit,' said Bradley. 'I want us to break it as soon as possible, because these games come back and haunt us, especially these close ones. We don't want to look later in the season and say, 'Man, we should have had that one.' ' As for what the Celts can do, Thomas said, 'I don't know honestly. I'm not going to use the excuse that we're playing so many guys or different types of lineups. We're professionals. We've just got to figure it out. Some way, somehow, we've got to figure it out. The coaching staff has to figure it out, and we've just got to go from there. We've got to come together and win these games together. It's tough to win in this league, but there's no excuses. We're expected to do something. A lot of people expected to go to the playoffs, but as of right now, we need to fix some things. 'There were stretches where we looked like a really good team and stretches where we looked like we didn't know what we were doing.' While there are still 78 opportunities to be better, the Celtics aren't too pleased with the view from 1-3.",['ENGLISH'],899,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

92,"Newspaper, Newspapers",FEATURES,Lifestyle,Make a splash'Find a Way' to stay active as you age,Don't let preconceived age limits hold you back,DIANA NYAD - LOS ANGELES TIMES,"I was 64 when I became the first to swim the 110.86 miles from Cuba to Florida, something I failed at when I was 28. The truth is, I am a better athlete in my mid-60s than I was, even as a world champion, in my mid-20s. The cliche is that we reach our prime in middle age because we are mature; we have found patience and perspective. We recognize that our time is more and more valuable with each fleeting year. We tap into a well of experience and open-mindedness.","All of this is true, but I also believe we can retain our physical vitality into our middle and even older years. There is no doubt that I am breathing the life force of my prime physical self now, at age 66. I am more resilient. My immune system is a stronger fortress. I can summon a brute strength I never had back in the day. I was a thoroughbred then, more finely tuned but also somewhat fragile. These days I'm more of a Clydesdale, sturdy and stalwart. If you told me I'd be left stranded in the wilderness for many months and could choose at which age I would attempt to survive the ordeal, I'd pick this very age, 66. Yes, this is a one-way journey we're all traveling, and it has an endpoint. We have to get real. I can't pretend I'm not a whole lot closer to the end than ever before.  What I rail against is the blanket limitations put on us by ... whom? Who has done the irrefutable calculations that say we're too old to work in our professions? Who decrees the assigned ages for productivity and creativity and vitality? I accept the laws of the universe when it comes to aging, but I point-blank refuse to cower in the face of weak and faulty statistics, geared for the masses, that pay little respect to the will and potential of the individual. I was recently chatting with a couple. The husband happened to mention that he was 54. His wife corrected him to say he was really 55, as his birthday was coming up in two days. He was adamant, all kidding aside: At that moment, he was still 54. The ultimate irony is that the people most freaked out by the numbers, the wrinkles, the widening of the midsection, waste more of their precious time denying aging than in pursuit of living hard. Think of all the minutes we'll never get back, the minutes we spent arguing with some stranger that we were not yet 55 but had two more days to go at 54. This is the crux of it all: We rabidly pursue youth in the name of appearing young. Too many of us aren't exercising our bodies and carefully contemplating every morsel we put into our mouths so that we can retain our youthful dynamism. We think our value lies in what age we are perceived to be rather than in empirical measurements of how we're performing and what we're experiencing. We baby boomers are lucky. The concepts of middle age and old age are sliding upward. We are feeling feisty at 50 and 60 and 70. These days we can reinvent ourselves. We can embrace our 'second acts' and be more successful, more spirited, more equipped in all ways, big and small, than we were the first time around.
