Among her achievements is &quot;The Thanksgiving Play,&quot; now on stage (so to speak) at <a href=""https://www.wamtheatre.com/"" target=""_blank"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(22, 141, 217); text-decoration: none; line-height: inherit; background: transparent;"">WAM Theatre</a>, based in Lenox, Massachusetts.<br/><br/>In this pandemic year, the video went live last night and is up through the weekend.<br/><br/>&quot;The Thanksgiving Play&quot; is a satire about a group of white teachers writing an elementary school play that combines the myth of the first Thanksgiving and Native American Heritage Month, which is November.<br/><br/>These are people with good intentions that go bad. Take the character of Logan, played by Molly Parker Myers: She used a grant to hire an actress thinking — because of her headshot — she was Native American.<br/><br/>She is not.<br/><br/>“So we&#39;re four white people, making a culturally sensitive First Thanksgiving for Native American Heritage Month? Oh my Goddess,” Logan says in the play.<br/><br/>“Whatever! It&#39;s theater!&quot; quips the character of Alicia, played by Carissa Marie Dagenais. “We don’t need actual Native Americans to tell a Native American story. I mean, none of us are actually pilgrims, are we?”<br/><br/>Another character points out the pilgrims didn’t call themselves Pilgrims.<br/><br/>Not to be defeated in her reasoning, Alicia whips through a list of Disney characters.<br/><br/>“Is Lumiere a real candlestick?” she posits.<br/><br/>“Actually, he kind of was,” says Jaxton, played by Tom Truss.<br/><br/>The characters are self-conscious, liberal and pat themselves on the back for being so.<br/><br/>But this witty play — about making a play — is a comedy with a bigger message about centuries of near erasure of Native Americans.<br/><br/>WAM’s production of “The Thanksgiving Play” begins with something that connects the audience to the local indigenous community. FastHorse asks this to happen in all productions. WAM produced a &quot;land acknowledgement&quot; video to start the show, with Heather Bruegl from the <a href=""https://www.mohican.com/"" target=""_blank"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(22, 141, 217); text-decoration: none; line-height: inherit; background: transparent;"">Stockbridge-Munsee community.</a><br/><br/>“I&#39;m honored to be coming to you today from our reservation lands in northeast Wisconsin, which was created by the Treaty of 1856. Prior to that, our homelands were in the Mahicantuck River Valley area, which, you know as the Hudson River Valley, along with other areas of New York, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Vermont and Connecticut.”<br/><br/>The Stockbridge-Munsee Community is a Mohican tribe that is now largely in Wisconsin. The tribe was forced west and north by white people taking their land over centuries.<br/><br/>“I think it&#39;s a vital play to be put on right now because we&#39;re at this moment of racial reckoning as a country and as an arts industry,” said Talya Kingston, the director of the WAM production, who was able to speak with FastHorse several times while developing the show.<br/><br/>This is a play that will allow white people attempting to do anti-racism work to see themselves, Kingston said, particularly in the week before Thanksgiving.<br/><br/>“It hopefully will allow them to laugh at themselves,&quot; then stopped and corrected herself, &quot;<i>our</i>selves, I should say, not <i>them</i>selves. But it&#39;s also a very sharp satire that Larissa has written from really knowing people.”<br/><br/>Including some educators who turn to the internet to find curriculum.<br/><br/>In one scene, the character of Logan — the elementary school teacher responsible for organizing the Thanksgiving pageant — is browsing the internet for engaging activities for her students. She finds a counting song, sung to the tune of &quot;The Twelve Days of Christmas.&quot; The lyrics: <br/><br/><b>On the fifth day of Thanksgiving, the natives gave to me...</b><br/><b>five pair of moccasins</b><br/><b>four bows and arrows,</b><br/><b>three native headdresses,</b><br/><b>two turkey gobbles,</b><br/><b>and a pumpkin in a pumpkin patch.</b><br/><br/>...and so on. The script indicates that any &quot;curriculum&quot; FastHorse wrote into the play was found in actual teacher posts online.<br/><br/>At the end of the counting song, the audience hears a a voiced &quot;teachers note&quot; guiding others who might use this material.<br/><br/>“This song can do more than teach counting. I divide my students into Indians and Pilgrims, so the Indians can practice sharing,” the teacher says.<br/><br/>It is a cringeworthy moment, Kingston said, in an activist play, as she called it, being produced by an activist theater.<br/><br/>WAM, which stands for “where arts and activism meet,” made sure to hire a Native American illustrator for the virtual production, <a href=""https://randomartbykwilson.com/"" target=""_blank"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(22, 141, 217); text-decoration: none; line-height: inherit; background: transparent;"">Katari Wilson</a>, and to connect the production with the Mohican tribe.<br/><br/>Kingston, who is white, admits at times she saw herself and her colleagues in some of FastHorse’s dialogue. WAM, she said, is not done doing <i>its </i>work.<br/><br/>“I absolutely think that we need to work more with Indigenous directors and artists going forward,” Kingston said. “I think it&#39;s an appropriate play for a white director to direct. It&#39;s a play about whiteness and about white privilege.”<br/><br/>FastHorse wasn’t available to be interviewed for this story, <a href=""https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2019/11/26/thanksgiving-play-larissa-fasthorse"" target=""_blank"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(22, 141, 217); text-decoration: none; line-height: inherit; background: transparent;"">but she’s previously said </a>“The Thanksgiving Play” is her least favorite work, her most depressing success, even as she loves the play.<br/><br/>She wrote it, she&#39;s said, in response to the feedback she was getting about her other work. She was told those plays couldn&#39;t be produced for a wide audience, because there weren&#39;t enough indigenous actors to portray her characters.<br/><br/>That&#39;s just not true, said <a href=""https://www.umass.edu/theater/member/priscilla-page"" target=""_blank"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(22, 141, 217); text-decoration: none; line-height: inherit; background: transparent;"">Priscilla Page</a>, who is of Wiyot heritage and researches Native American theater.<br/><br/>“If you look at the last four decades of Native American theater, you will find plays do get produced and there are Native American actors who can and do act professionally,” Page said.<br/><br/>Page is also a dramaturge, a historian and a theater professor at UMass Amherst.

Article,In From The Cold: Martha’s Vineyard To Open Its First Dedicated Homeless Shelter,In From The Cold: Martha’s Vineyard To Open Its First Dedicated Homeless Shelter,"For the past five winters, three Martha’s Vineyard churches took turns sheltering the homeless on different nights of the week. But those pop-up shelters relied mostly on elder volunteers, and they closed abruptly in March because of COVID-19.<br/><br/>This fall, a committee went looking for a new location. What they found could change the island’s approach to homelessness.<br/><br/>The process wasn’t easy. In late October, with winter imminent, the Vineyard still had no shelter.<br/><br/>The Rev. Chip Seadale, an Episcopal priest, was part of the group looking for a new location. He checked out a possibility in Oak Bluffs: the Portuguese-American Club.<br/><br/>“It&#39;s basically a function hall,” he said as he walked the grounds. “I think it&#39;s going to serve our purposes well.”<br/><br/>Seadale hoped it would be the right place to open a single-location shelter, run at least partially by paid staff.<br/><br/>“The problem with having this in more than one site for this winter was we probably were not going to be able to recruit so many volunteers,” he said.<br/><br/>The club looked good, but when the committee studied the space more closely, they realized it wasn’t large enough to socially distance 13 homeless guests and two overnight staff.<br/><br/>They were once again up against a very Vineyard problem: real estate.<br/><br/>Money wasn’t the issue. Martha’s Vineyard Hospital pledged $150,000. And family foundations started coming forward — five so far — plus individual donors.<br/><br/>Hospital CEO Denise Schepici said the trouble finding a location has a lot to do with the stigma of homelessness.<br/><br/>“Absolutely,” she said. “When we think homeless, you know, ... we think, ‘Oh, God, these are people nobody wants in their backyard,’ right? They’re in your backyard. They&#39;re sleeping in your sheds. They&#39;re sleeping in cars outside … the woods.”<br/><br/>Before the rotating shelter system started five years ago, just about the only place for homeless people to go on cold nights was the hospital emergency room. Dr. Karen Casper remembers it well.<br/><br/>“We give people blankets,” she said. “We give people food. We give people what they need, and I don&#39;t think we thought twice about doing it. It was the right thing to do.”<br/><br/>So the island went from having no shelter, to a system in which the actual beds had to be moved between three different locations each week.<br/><br/>COVID-19 has pushed the community toward a more permanent solution, albeit only for the five coldest months of the year right now.<br/><br/>And still, after months of looking and offering to pay rent near $10,000 a month, no space seemed to be available.<br/><br/>Then, a breakthrough: The Vineyard Trust offered the basement of the Old Whaling Church.<br/><br/>“It’s in a wonderful location,” said Karen Tewhey, director of the homelessness prevention organization Harbor Homes. “It&#39;s on the bus line. It&#39;s in downtown Edgartown.”<br/><br/>She said the space is about 2,500 square feet — more than enough to meet COVID-19 guidelines.<br/><br/>“I think it&#39;s going to be comfortable, safe and a healthy environment for all of the individuals that may get to use it,” she said.<br/><br/>It will be an emergency shelter open to anyone, including people who don’t qualify for temporary housing in hotels because of behavioral history or an encounter with police.<br/><br/>With the new location, the committee is talking about adding hours, so guests can come in from the cold by 5 p.m. instead of 7, stay until 9 a.m., and come inside to warm up for two hours in the middle of the day.<br/><br/>Tewhey said they’re consulting with Martha’s Vineyard Hospital on COVID-19 safety.<br/><br/>“This is also a turning point for the island, because there&#39;s a recognition that shelter is needed,” she said.<br/><br/>The hope is to create a dedicated shelter — and a lasting change in how the Vineyard extends a hand to the unhoused.",Jennette Barnes,Tue Nov 24 15:48:23 EST 2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,Retail Behemoth Amazon May Be Coming To The Site of A Defunct Worcester Mall,Retail Behemoth Amazon May Be Coming To The Site of A Defunct Worcester Mall,"A site plan filed with the city of Worcester’s Planning Board suggests that an Amazon distribution center may soon be moving into a parcel of land along I-190, and close to I-290, that once housed the Greendale Mall.<br/><br/>The newest proposal filed this week calls for the demolition of the more than 300,000-square-foot mall, and the construction of a 121,212-square-foot warehouse and distribution center on the site. But while the application makes no mention of Amazon, as is often the case with submissions for Amazon properties, the permit application holds a clue that points toward the giant online retailer.<br/><br/>According to the <a href=""https://www.telegram.com/story/news/2020/11/25/application-hints-amazon-could-coming-greendale-mall-site/6424739002/"" target=""_blank"">Worcester Telegram</a>, the section outlining off-street parking mentions that “the proposed tenant of the new building is working to produce 10,000 electric vans by 2022 and 100,000 by 2030 and is working on a strategy to be net zero carbon across their business by 2040.&quot;<br/><br/>Amazon uses almost identical language in its <a href=""https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/transportation/introducing-amazons-first-custom-electric-delivery-vehicle"">Climate Pledge commitment</a>, which states that the company will be carbon neutral in 20 years. <br/><br/>Worcester City Manager Edward M. Augustus, Jr. said he can’t confirm who the tenant is, but he’s happy to see someone going into the site.<br/><br/>“Though no lease has been signed as of yet, we have been notified by the developer that they have marketed the site to several tenants, including large distribution centers,” he said. “While we don’t have the particular details as of yet, we look forward to the redevelopment of that site and the jobs that are created as a result.”<br/><br/>Amazon declined to comment on the permit application, but a spokesperson said in an email that “Amazon is a dynamic business and we are constantly exploring new locations. We weigh a variety of factors when deciding where to develop future sites to best serve customers.&quot;<br/><br/>Representatives of the Boston-based Finard Properties, which owns the now-defunct Greendale Mall, were not reachable for comment. The company purchased the property last December for $7.1 million. At the time, Chief Executive Officer Todd Finard called the site a “prime candidate for redevelopment” and said he envisioned transforming the property into “a modern and unique, mixed-use destination.”<br/><br/>Former Worcester Mayor Ray Mariano said he has mixed feelings about the prospect of an Amazon warehouse moving in. <br/><br/>“There’s no real housing in the area, there’s no one whose life is going to be disrupted by trucks coming in and out because it’s an interchange with two highways, so it’s the proper use,” Mariano said. <br/><br/>“Initially, my response would be that the job creation is an excellent opportunity,” he added. “They pay excellent wages and we have a lot of people in that area – immediate area – who would be excellent candidates for employment. So, the initial response would be that the job creation is something the city would be excited about.”<br/><br/>That said, Mariano holds out hope that the site could still become a mixed-use property, providing office space and much-needed housing for the city.<br/><br/>“Housing, which was part of the original proposal for the site, would’ve been an excellent usage for that area,” he said.

Article,'Buy Me Boston Volume 2': A Look At Clever Ads From The 1960s to 1980s,'Buy Me Boston Volume 2': A Look At Clever Ads From The 1960s to 1980s,"<i>Author Brian Coleman returns with the second volume of </i>Buy Me Boston<i>, a curated collection of local ads and flyers that takes longtime Boston residents back to life between the 1960’s and 1980’s. Coleman spoke to GBH Radio’s Henry Santoro about his archival project. The transcript below has been edited for clarity.</i><br/><br/><b>Henry Santoro: </b>Some of the many things that make Boston unique have been hiding in plain sight, and they&#39;ve been hiding for some time. They come in the form of old advertisements, everything from restaurants and hair salons to clothing stores and radio stations. There are flyers for bands that don&#39;t exist anymore, who are playing clubs that also don&#39;t exist anymore. Well, we can credit pop culture kingpin Brian Coleman for gathering up the crème de la crème of these local ads and flyers from the 1960’s through the 1980’s and putting them into books that he calls <i>Buy Me Boston</i>. Volume One came out a couple years ago to rave reviews, also by me — I gave it a rave review too, and now <i>Buy Me Boston</i> <i>Volume Two</i> is out and at just under 300 pages, this is a book that will take you down a rabbit hole you will thoroughly enjoy going down. Brian Coleman, welcome back to GBH and Henry in the Hub. <br/><br/><b>Brian Coleman:</b> Thank you very much. Great to be with you. <br/><br/><b>Henry Santoro: </b>Tell us how this original project came to be. <br/><br/><b>Brian Coleman: </b>I guess I would credit the original one with two different archives, two people. And that would be David Bieber, the renowned saver of all things who has an incredible archive out in Norwood, and Kay Bourne, who was the longtime arts writer for <i>The</i> <i>Bay State Banner</i>. And I had gotten to know both of them better, and started to realize what they had accomplished and what they had done by saving all this. And I think sometimes when you take so much time saving — which is actually the same thing with a lot of university archives — you don&#39;t do as much sharing because you&#39;re so busy gathering. And so I started to see myself as someone who could help with that sharing process. And then I guess I just fumbled into being a what I would call more of a curator than an author. <br/><br/><b>Henry Santoro: </b>What do you think these ads in these flyers and these band placards say about Boston during that time period of the sixties to the eighties? <br/><br/><b>Brian Coleman: </b>I mean, I guess the one thing, and it&#39;s not necessarily unique to Boston, but it&#39;s just kind of creativity. It&#39;s kind of — especially if we&#39;re talking sixties into the mid-seventies — there were no rules, necessarily, whether that was visually or kind of textually, the way you would kind of present things. That&#39;s kind of what I love about it. I mean, I think my favorite ads, if I had to point to one publication in one era, would be the late sixties’ <i>Boston After Dark</i> because they were meant to blend in with the reading of the newspaper itself, meaning you would kind of read everything. You would read the articles and you would read the ads. And the ads were things that you were meant to take time and look at. There were Boston Tea Party ads where you almost have to decipher what the text is. Like, wait, where is the show and what time is it?

Article,"18 Years After Station Nightclub Fire, Author Examines New Evidence","18 Years After Station Nightclub Fire, Author Examines New Evidence","A new book is shedding new light on an 18-year-old tragedy, suggesting that the 2003 Station nightclub fire in West Warwick RI may have been the fault of more than just the owners of the nightclub who were convicted along with the band manager who set off the pyrotechnics that killed 100 people and injured 230 others.<br/><br/>In an interview with GBH News, Scott James, the author of Trial By Fire reveals documents and evidence he investigated that suggest a host of people in official positions were culpable in the tragedy and got off scot free, after prosecutors refused/failed to hold any public trial. <br/> <br/> “This is a story about people being failed by the institutions that we believe are going to be there to protect us from a tragedy like this or in the aftermath help us.” James said “And that does not happen for the people who are the victims of this fire.”<br/> <br/> The Station nightclub was a run-down roadhouse in the old New England mill town. The fire on February 20, 2003, destroyed the club - and remains the 4th deadliest nightclub fire in U.S. history.<br/> <br/> The tragedy happened during a set of the hard rock band, Great White. Within seconds of the band taking the stage, what began as a raucous good time, became a terrifying scene. Band manager Daniel Biechele set off pyrotechnics inside the club. <br/> <br/> The fireworks ignited highly flammable and toxic soundproofing foam along the walls, and ceiling. There were no sprinklers. <br/><br/>“Look, when those fireworks were let off, people in the club initially thought it was part of the show,” James said. “They thought it was a special effect.”<br/><br/>James conducted the first interview with club owners Jeffrey and Michael Derderian, and combed through documents from U.S. Attorney Patrick Lynch’s office that pointed to other entities’ actions that possibly contributed to the fire including the West Warwick Fire inspector who approved the foam and added audience capacity, and executives at the soundproofing foam company.<br/><br/>During his investigation, James learned the prosecutors&#39; office conducted mock trials to test their case.<br/> <br/> “And in each of the three mock trials, the defendants, the nightclub owners, the Derdarians, were not convicted,” James said. “When I learned this, I realized, OK, wait a minute. From what I read in the newspaper and seen on TV, this is an open and shut case.” <br/><br/>James says he wrote his book because he was troubled by the rush to judgement against the two brothers who owned the club, Jeffrey, and Michael Derderian.<br/> <br/> “The justice system, that justice failed in this case because a lot of people, a lot of other people, besides those who were accused, were culpable and they were never indicted and they were never pursued.”<br/> <br/> James tries to tackle the question of whether this was an accident or a crime and points to a statement made condemning the Derderians while the tragedy was unfolding.<br/> <br/> “The local police chief, while the incident is happening, gives an interview to the Associated Press,” James said. “He says that the nightclub owners, these two brothers, Michael and Jeffrey Derderian, quote, ‘most definitely will be indicted’”<br/> <br/>Robin Petrarca was inside the club when the fire started. She escaped through an exit by the bar, but nine of her friends perished. <br/> <br/>“Sure, there was a rush to judgment, because when any form of a tragedy happens, I think that people need to find something to focus on who to blame if somebody&#39;s fault,” she said. <br/> <br/>GBH News did the first broadcast interview with WPRI-TV photographer Brian Butler, who was videotaping inside the club for a news story on public venue safety. Butler he was vilified after the fire and accused of not helping others escape the fire.<br/><br/>“You can look back and judge and you can look back and try to twist it in any way you want,” he said. “But what happened, happened the way it happened. And I can&#39;t change what I did.”<br/><br/>Butler said his instincts took over as soon as he saw the fire climb the walls through his viewfinder and he headed for the exit. <br/><br/>But at the doors, there was bottleneck of people pushing forward to get out and Butler was squeezed up against a woman Infront of him.<br/><br/>“She said, ‘Oh, I can&#39;t breathe, I can&#39;t breathe!’ I think I was pushing on her a little too hard, maybe she was getting crushed,” Butler said. “So I backed off and I said, ‘Relax, relax, we&#39;ll get out of here.’ And then the smoke alarm went off over my head. So the first thing I told myself was, ‘Don&#39;t panic.’” <br/><br/>Butler fled through the front door and says he tried to help others and did push out a panel on the exterior wall. Years later, Butler met a man who told him he escaped through it. It gives him some solace, but the horror of that night stays with him, along with an enormous amount of guilt.<br/><br/>WPRI-TV and the station’s then-owners LIN TV made an out-of-court settlement of $30 million dollars as a result of a claim that Butler was obstructing escape and not sufficiently helping people exit.<br/><br/> Jody King, a Rhode Island Quahogger grew up with the Derderians. His brother Tracy was a bouncer at the club and didn&#39;t make it out. And to this day doesn’t blame them for his brother’s death. <br/> <br/> “It was an accident,” King said. ”Nobody got up in the morning and said it&#39;s going to be a good day for one hundred to die, no one.”<br/><br/>There was an investigation of the fire, and in 2003 a grand jury indicted Great White&#39;s manager manager Dan Biechele - who lit the pyrotechnics - and the Derderian brothers on 200 counts of involuntary manslaughter. <br/>But a criminal or civil trial was never held. And no one had a chance to testify and share what they knew about events that led to the fire. <br/> <br/> In 2006, Biechele pleaded guilty and the Derderians pleaded no contest. Biechele and Michael Derderian were sentenced to serve 4 years in jail and Jeffrey received a suspended sentence and 500 hours of community service. <br/> <br/> At his sentencing Jeff Derderian apologized to the families. <br/> <br/> “I tried like so many other people that night to do all I could, but the fire moved so fast. I was scared and I wished I did a better job.”<br/> <br/> Jeff Derderian issued a statement to GBH News saying Scott James’ book is factually accurate.<br/> <br/> The National Institute of Fire and Safety Training uses the fire video taken by Brian Butler for training purposes. Butler says it confirms how quickly a fire can get out of control. <br/> <br/> “Seventy-two seconds to get out the door,” Butler said. “Seventy-two seconds. And in ninety it was full of the toxic black smoke.”<br/> <br/>Survivors and families of victims received a $176 million dollar settlement. None of the others contacted would comment.<br/><br/>In addition to LIN TV, several other companies including American Foam Corporation, the State of Rhode Island and the town of West Warwick also paid millions of dollars in the settlement.<br/><br/>Survivor Robin Petrarca said all these years later, she holds dear the simple things in life.<br/><br/>“It truly makes you appreciate every day more,” she said. “And I think that that&#39;s the one thing that I know life is precious. And in the blink of an eye, things can change.” <br/><br/>In 2017, The Station Fire Memorial Park opened on the same property where the fire took place.<br/><br/><b><i>Disclosure: </i></b><i>Jeff Derderian and Marilyn Schairer worked together at WPRI-TV in East Providence at the time of the fire and previously at ABC6 News where author Scott James, a three-time Emmy Award winning journalist was News Director and their boss.</i>",00000176-7302-de44-a77e-771288a60000,Fri Dec 18 16:30:06 EST 2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,Beyond COVID-19: The 9 Other Massachusetts Stories That Made Headlines In 2020,Beyond COVID-19: The 9 Other Massachusetts Stories That Made Headlines In 2020,"Massachusetts’ biggest story of 2020 involved something so tiny it required an electron microscope to view.<br/><br/>The coronavirus pandemic hit the Bay State hard, killing nearly 12,000 — the nation&#39;s ninth-highest death toll — and ravaging communities of color and long-term care facilities. Nearly 80 veterans died of COVID-19 at the Holyoke Soldiers&#39; Home, where investigators said “utterly baffling” decisions allowed the virus to spread unchecked.<br/><br/>But Massachusetts also played a pivotal role in the global race for a vaccine. Studies showed a vaccine developed by Cambridge-based Moderna Inc. offered strong protection against the virus, and the company began shipping it out after gaining emergency approval from the Food and Drug Administration.<br/><br/>Here are the other top stories that grabbed headlines and attention in 2020:<br/><br/>1. College Admissions Scandal<br/><br/>Federal prosecutions of parents who paid bribes to get their children into competitive U.S. colleges and universities were a top story in 2019, and this past year, two of the most prominent defendants were brought to justice. “Full House” actress Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, both were sentenced to prison time — appearing before a federal judge in Boston via video link because of the pandemic.<br/><br/>2. Kennedy Out; Warren Falls Short<br/><br/>U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren&#39;s failed bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, after considerable momentum early in the campaign cycle, dominated politics in Massachusetts. So did U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy III, a grandson of Robert F. Kennedy, who gambled — and lost — big by betting he could win the Democratic primary. Sen. Edward Markey, a progressive, prevailed, and Kennedy became the first in his storied political dynasty to lose a race for Congress in Massachusetts.<br/><br/>3. Harvard Cleared Of Bias<br/><br/>A federal appeals court ruled that Harvard doesn&#39;t discriminate against Asian American applicants. The decision offered relief to other colleges that consider race in admissions, but also set the stage for a potential review by an increasingly conservative U.S. Supreme Court. The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston rejected claims from an anti-affirmative action group that accused the Ivy League University of imposing a “racial penalty” on Asian Americans.<br/><br/>4. Tsarnaev&#39;s Death Sentence Tossed<br/><br/>A federal appeals court threw out Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev’s death sentence, saying the judge who oversaw the case did not adequately screen jurors for potential biases. The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered a new penalty-phase trial on whether the 27-year-old Tsarnaev should be executed for the 2013 attack that killed three people and wounded more than 260 others. The Justice Department asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case.<br/><br/>5. High Court History<br/><br/>Justice Kimberly Budd made history as she was sworn in as the chief justice of Massachusetts’ highest court. Budd, 54, is the first Black woman to serve as chief justice of the Supreme Judicial Court, which traces its history to the late 17th century. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker nominated her to succeed Chief Justice Ralph Gants, an acclaimed jurist who died in September.<br/><br/>6. Bye Bye Brady<br/><br/>Nobody knew it at the time, but on Jan. 4, Tom Brady played his last game as a Patriot at Gillette Stadium. The six-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback&#39;s storied run in New England ended with a thud and a 20-13 loss to the Tennessee Titans. Two and a half months later, Brady embarked on what he called a “new football journey” and signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, where he was joined by former Patriots star Rob Gronkowski.<br/><br/>7. The Mayflower&#39;s 400th<br/><br/>The state marked the 400th anniversary of the 1620 Pilgrim landing, but unconventionally, and not just because of coronavirus restrictions. Yearlong events emphasized the history and experience of the Indigenous people who, at their own peril, helped the white European settlers survive. Members of the Wampanoag tribe and the descendants of those who sailed from England on the Mayflower — mindful of 2020&#39;s nationwide reckoning with entrenched racism — were determined to openly and truthfully revisit the Pilgrims&#39; complicated legacy.<br/><br/>8. Ex-Nissan CEO&#39;s Escape<br/><br/>A father and son from Massachusetts allegedly helped spirit former Nissan Motor Co. CEO Carlos Ghosn out of Japan while he was awaiting trial. The U.S. State Department agreed to turn over Michael Taylor, a U.S. Army Special Forces veteran, and his son, Peter Taylor. A federal judge intervened to block the men&#39;s immediate removal while she reviewed an emergency petition filed by their lawyers. The Taylors are charged with helping Ghosn flee the country in 2019 with the former Nissan boss tucked away in a box on a private jet.<br/><br/>9. eBay Harassment<br/><br/>Five former employees of eBay Inc. pleaded guilty to charges stemming from their alleged involvement in a cyberstalking campaign. Federal prosecutors said the scheme included having live spiders and other disturbing deliveries sent to a Massachusetts couple who had published an online newsletter critical of the online auction site. Two other employees also were charged. Investigators said the victims were targeted after their newsletter published an article about a lawsuit filed by eBay that accused Amazon of poaching its sellers. San Jose, California-based eBay fired the employees.<br/>",William J. Kole | Associated Press,Mon Dec 28 13:03:40 EST 2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Article,Fear Of Deportation Prompts Undocumented Immigrants To Resist COVID-19 Vaccine ,Fear Of Deportation Prompts Undocumented Immigrants To Resist COVID-19 Vaccine ,"<b><i>Updated Jan. 7, 2020, at 8:21 p.m.</i></b><br/><br/>Immigrants across Massachusetts have resisted getting the COVID-19 vaccine out of fear of deportation or others legal consequences, according to lawyers, activists and community leaders.<br/><br/>“We have been fielding phone calls from individuals who are concerned that they will be deported if they get a vaccine,” Iván Espinoza-Madrigal, of Lawyers for Civil Rights, told GBH News. “We have been advising individuals and families that they absolutely must make themselves available for testing and vaccination and that these activities will not trigger immigration consequences, but the harm has already been done. The misconceptions exist.” <br/><br/>It would be illegal for medical officials to share information with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But such concerns are still likely to hurt a public vaccination campaign, Espinoza-Madrigal says, which could compromise the wider population’s ability to reach herd immunity.<br/><br/>“(It&#39;s) not because immigrants are trying to be difficult but because the Trump administration has created such tremendous fear and insecurity in immigrant communities that the trust has been broken,” Espinoza-Madrigal said. “It&#39;s going to take a significant effort from public health officials and local governments to fill that trust gap so that immigrants can come forth for vaccination.” <br/><br/>In January of last year, the Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration could enact a “public charge” rule against documented immigrants who use federal resources, allowing the government to block their applications for permanent residency, also known as a green card. That&#39;s caused many immigrants to resist accepting CARES Act benefits or signing up for federally-funded COVID-19 tests or vaccines, according to Amy Grunder, director of legislative affairs at the MIRA Coalition. <br/><br/>“People are afraid,” Grunder told GBH News. “They think that if there&#39;s some possibility of securing a path to citizenship, they don&#39;t want this to get in the way.”<br/><br/>Last February, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services excluded COVID-19 testing and treatment from the public charge rule, encouraging &quot;all those, including aliens, with symptoms that resemble coronavirus ... to seek necessary medical treatment or preventive services.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Such treatment or preventive services will not negatively affect any alien as part of a future public charge analysis,&quot; <a target=""_blank"" class=""c-link"" data-stringify-link=""https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/green-card-processes-and-procedures/public-charge"" delay=""150"" data-sk=""tooltip_parent"" href=""https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/green-card-processes-and-procedures/public-charge"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" style=""box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(var(--sk_highlight,18,100,163),1); text-decoration: none; font-family: Slack-Lato, appleLogo, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(34, 37, 41);"">the update</a> reads.<br/><br/>Immigrants served by the MIRA coalition have also expressed fears that information shared at a vaccination site may be leaked to ICE and may lead to a deportation, even though medical privacy laws would prevent such information sharing, Grunder said. <br/><br/>“Over the last four years, immigrants have had a justifiable fear that any interaction with federal officials, particularly ICE, could be a disaster for themselves and their families,” Grunder said. “Because of that, because of fears of family separation, they become unwilling to seek access to other kinds of institutions as well as well; people are afraid to contact law enforcement, people are afraid to go to court for a restraining order, people are afraid to get care in hospitals and people are afraid to get other kinds of of medical assistance as well.” <br/><br/>Ensuring that undocumented immigrants feel safe in getting vaccinated will significantly slow the spread of the virus, according to Helena DaSilva Hughes, the executive director at the Immigrants Assistance Center, which serves a population of roughly 12,000 immigrants per year in New Bedford. <br/><br/>“It has to be free, simple and no questions asked,” DaSilva Hughes told GBH News. “It also has to be members of their community who they trust. They have to take the vaccine and show that it’s safe.” <br/><br/>Dasilva Hughes says many immigrants, particularly those who work in the city’s more than 45 fish “houses,” factories and processing centers, were reluctant to get tested for COVID-19 until Gov. Charlie Baker implemented the Stop the Spread testing sites. <br/><br/>“Stop the Spread worked quite beautifully in New England because it was free and no questions asked,” DaSilva Hughes said. “We saw a lot of testing being done, and what I am hoping is that the same system used for Stop the Spread will be utilized when the vaccine gets here for the general population.” <br/><br/>Since the beginning of the pandemic, DaSilva Hughes has been on an information-sharing campaign — hosting a local community-access television show in Portuguese, working with local religious and community leaders to quell misinformation regarding testing and the vaccine and communicating with her own clients the importance of utilizing federal resources. <br/><br/>“We know that there&#39;s a lack of trust within the immigrant population. They don&#39;t trust too many people,” DaSilva Hughes said. “We know that they trust the churches and they trust us, because we&#39;ve been around for 50 years and we provide services to them. We represent them, we look like them and they trust us, which is very important.” <br/><br/>DaSilva Hughes said she was skeptical about the vaccine at one point herself — until she heard a doctor from the community explain what the vaccine was and how it worked.<br/><br/>“By the time he finished explaining in the program about the vaccine, I was ready to take it,&quot; she said. &quot;It depends who&#39;s giving the message. We, as the leaders of the community, need to show that we trust it and so it’s okay for them to trust it, too.”<br/><br/><i>Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that the public rule charge could determine that undocumented immigrants are ineligible for citizenship. The public rule charge only affects permanent residency, also known as a green card. The article also stated that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services suspended the public charge rule last February.

Article,Capitol Violence Sparks A Social Media Reckoning With Trump,Capitol Violence Sparks A Social Media Reckoning With Trump,"All it took for social-media giants Twitter and Facebook to even temporarily bar President Donald Trump from addressing their vast audiences was a violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, fueled by years of false statements, conspiracy theories and violent rhetoric from the president.<br/><br/>On Wednesday, in an unprecedented step, <a href=""https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1346970430062485505"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; text-decoration: none; background-color: transparent; font-size: inherit; cursor: pointer; color: rgb(28, 167, 218); font-family: &quot;AP Serif&quot;; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;"">the two companies temporarily suspended Trump</a> from posting to their platforms after a mob of his supporters stormed the house of Congress. It was the most aggressive action either company has yet taken against Trump, who more than a decade ago embraced the immediacy and scale of Twitter to rally loyalists, castigate enemies and spread false rumors.<br/><br/>Twitter locked Trump out of his account for 12 hours and said that future violations could result in a permanent suspension. The company required the removal of three of Trump&#39;s tweets, including a short video in which he urged those supporters to “go home” while also repeating falsehoods about the integrity of the presidential election. Trump&#39;s account deleted those posts, Twitter said; had they remained, Twitter had threatened to extend his suspension.<br/><br/>Facebook and Instagram, which Facebook owns, followed up in the evening, announcing that Trump wouldn&#39;t be able to post for 24 hours following two violations of its policies. The White House did not immediately offer a response to the actions.<br/><br/>While some cheered the platforms&#39; actions, experts noted that the companies&#39; actions follow years of hemming and hawing on Trump and his supporters spreading dangerous misinformation and encouraging violence that have contributed to Wednesday&#39;s violence.<br/><br/>Jennifer Grygiel, a Syracuse University communications professor and an expert on social media, said Wednesday’s events in Washington, D.C. are a direct result of Trump’s use of social media to spread propaganda and disinformation, and that the platforms should bear some responsibility for their inaction.<br/><br/>“This is what happens,” Grygiel said. “We didn’t just see a breach at the Capitol. Social media platforms have been breached by the president repeatedly. This is disinformation. This was a coup attempt in the United States.”<br/><br/>Grygiel said the platform’s decision to remove the video — and Twitter’s suspension — are too little, too late.<br/><br/>“They’re creeping along towards firmer action,” Grygiel said, calling Trump “Exhibit A” for the need for greater regulation of social media. “Social media is complicit in this because he has repeatedly used social media to incite violence. It’s a culmination of years of propaganda and abuse of media by the president of the United States.&quot;<br/><br/>Trump posted the video more than two hours after <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/congress-confirm-joe-biden-78104aea082995bbd7412a6e6cd13818"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; text-decoration: none; background-color: transparent; font-size: inherit; cursor: pointer; color: rgb(28, 167, 218); font-family: &quot;AP Serif&quot;; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;"">protesters entered the Capitol</a>, interrupting lawmakers meeting in an extraordinary joint session to confirm the Electoral College results and President-elect Joe Biden’s victory.<br/><br/>So far, YouTube has not taken similar action to muzzle Trump, although it said it also removed Trump&#39;s video. But that video remained available as of Wednesday afternoon.<br/><br/>Guy Rosen, Facebook’s vice president of integrity, said on Twitter Wednesday that the video was removed because it “contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence.”<br/><br/>“This is an emergency situation and we are taking appropriate emergency measures, including removing President Trump’s video,” Rosen said.<br/><br/>Twitter initially left the video up but blocked people from being able to retweet it or comment on it. Only later in the day did the platform delete it entirely.<br/><br/>Trump opened his video saying, “I know your pain. I know your hurt. But you have to go home now.”<br/><br/>After repeating false claims about voter fraud affecting the election, Trump went on to say: “We can’t play into the hands of these people. We have to have peace. So go home. We love you. You’re very special.”<br/><br/>Republican lawmakers and previous administration officials had begged Trump to give a statement to his supporters to quell the violence. He posted his video as authorities struggled to take control of a chaotic situation at the Capitol that led to the evacuation of lawmakers and the death of at least one person.<br/><br/>Trump has harnessed social media — especially Twitter — as a potent tool for spreading misinformation about the election. Wednesday&#39;s riot only increased calls to ban Trump from the platform.<br/><br/>“The President has promoted sedition and incited violence,&quot; Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive officer of the Anti-Defamation League said in a statement. “More than anything, what is happening right now at the Capitol is a direct result of the fear and disinformation that has been spewed consistently from the Oval Office.&quot;<br/><br/>In a statement Thursday morning, Trump said there would be an “orderly transition on January 20th” and acknowledged defeat in the election for the first time. His aides posted the statement on Twitter because his account remained suspended.<br/>",Barbara Ortutay and David Klepper | Associated Press,Thu Jan 07 06:33:54 EST 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Article,"Activists Fear 'Fascist Uprising,' Call For Community Action","Activists Fear 'Fascist Uprising,' Call For Community Action","More than 100 protesters gathered outside the Massachusetts State House on Thursday to oppose Wednesday&#39;s violence in Washington, D.C., and call for community action against what many described as a rising tide of &quot;fascism&quot; in the United States.<br/><br/>“If they want a civil war, we are the party for socialism and liberation — and we say we don&#39;t need a civil war, we need a class war,” Dorchester-based activist Nino Brown told the crowd. “We need to get rid of not just Trump but the followers of fascism, because America was always a far right country.”<br/><br/>Massachusetts activists from local organizations including Refuse Fascism and Boston Socialist Alternative have vowed to continue protesting every day until President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated. <br/><br/>Toya Chester, an organizer with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 103, a labor union, urged the crowd to continue organizing long after Biden is in office. <br/><br/>“Trump is just a symptom and a symbol of what goes on in your society every day,” Chester told the crowd. “It&#39;s clear that these far-right-wing forces are more organized than ever, and that&#39;s why they need to be stopped.” <br/><br/>Following remarks from Trump that the 2020 presidential election was “stolen from us” on Wednesday, thousands of pro-Trump extremists stormed the Capitol as part of a “Stop the Steal” demonstration, falsely claiming that Trump, who lost both the Electoral College and the popular vote, was the true winner. <br/><br/>“I don’t know if anybody in the crowd has illusions in Biden, but I sure don’t like that the Democrats aren’t equipped to handle Trump or the far right,” Chester said, “They&#39;ve had plenty of opportunities, and they have completely failed. We cannot wait and see if they&#39;re going to stand up for us. We have to do it ourselves.”<bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1610075045734,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1610075045734,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000176-dff2-dd07-a17e-fffedf390001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000176-dff2-d4ee-a5fe-fff7c4150000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000176-dff2-d4ee-a5fe-fff7c3d70000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">DSC_2881.jpg</bsp-image><br/>Before meeting at the state house, a separate protest led by local organizers from Refuse Fascism, a movement formed in response to Trump’s election, held a moment of silence at the Holocaust memorial in the North End. <br/><br/>“People have to understand there&#39;s a certain development of history, and people need to understand that history,” Stan Lawrence, an organizer for Refuse Fascism, told GBH News. “They need to look at things like the Holocaust — which was, for younger people, a while back — and realize that it was real. Millions and millions of people died because the German people did not act in a way that could have prevented that from happening. We have those lessons to learn from, and we need to act on them.” <br/><br/>For activist Scott Gilbert, those lessons are personal. Gilbert carries a photo in his wallet of a young Anne Frank sitting beside Gabrielle Dorothy Kahn — Gilbert&#39;s mother. <br/><br/>“I carry it with me because it kind of brings it home and makes it real,” Gilbert said. “That&#39;s what happened in the Capitol, and that’s what’s happening now, if we don’t stop it.” <br/><br/>Gilbert, a 67-year-old Somerville resident, wants to see a national movement to “move the goalposts” of the political spectrum left after four years of a Trump presidency. <br/><br/>“It&#39;s going to take a lot of work, and people have to sacrifice. But part of that is taking responsibility and acting,” Gilbert said. “And as people act, we can change this. It&#39;s not a foregone conclusion. I remember living in 1965, during the war in Vietnam, and I grew up with that. I have the advantage of seeing that kind of change can actually happen. Change is very real and very possible. But people have to act to make it happen.” <br/><br/>The crowd marched from the State House to the steps of Boston City Hall, ending with speakers like Blythe Serrano, an 18-year-old UMass student and activist who called on the crowd with a similar message. <br/><br/>“What is the solution to all of this violence, racism and xenophobia?” Serrano asked the crowd. “A grassroots, multiracial, multiethnic movement of students and working people. We need to be organizing in our schools and workplaces. We need to be out in the streets. We need to be on strike every day.”",Tori Bedford,Thu Jan 07 22:40:56 EST 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They mortally wounded another officer with a blunt weapon and body-slammed a third over a railing into the crowd.<br/><br/>“Hang Mike Pence!&quot; the insurrectionists chanted as they pressed inside, beating police with pipes. They demanded House Speaker Nancy Pelosi&#39;s whereabouts, too. They hunted any and all lawmakers: “Where are they?” Outside, makeshift gallows stood, complete with sturdy wooden steps and the noose. Guns and pipe bombs had been stashed in the vicinity.<br/><br/>Only days later is the extent of the danger from one of the darkest episodes in American democracy coming into focus. The sinister nature of the assault has become evident, betraying the crowd as a force determined to occupy the inner sanctums of Congress and run down leaders — Trump’s vice president and the Democratic House speaker among them.<br/><br/>This was not just a collection of Trump supporters with MAGA bling caught up in a wave.<br/><br/>That revelation came in real time to Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., who briefly took over proceedings in the House chamber as the mob closed in Wednesday and the speaker, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, was spirited to safer quarters moments before everything went haywire.<br/><br/>“I saw this crowd of people banging on that glass screaming,” McGovern told The Associated Press on Sunday. “Looking at their faces, it occurred to me, these aren’t protesters. These are people who want to do harm.”<br/><br/>“What I saw in front of me,&quot; he said, “was basically home-grown fascism, out of control.&quot;<br/><br/>Pelosi said Sunday “the evidence is that it was a well-planned, organized group with leadership and guidance and direction. And the direction was to go get people.” She did not elaborate on that point in a ”60 Minutes&quot; interview on CBS.<br/><br/>The scenes of rage, violence and agony are so vast that the whole of it may still be beyond comprehension. But with countless smartphone videos emerging from the scene, much of it from gloating insurrectionists themselves, and more lawmakers recounting the chaos that was around them, contours of the uprising are increasingly coming into relief.<br/><br/>___<br/><br/>THE STAGING<br/><br/>The mob got explicit marching orders from Trump and still more encouragement from the president&#39;s men.<br/><br/>“Fight like hell,” Trump exhorted his partisans at the staging rally. “Let’s have trial by combat,” implored his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, whose attempt to throw out election results in trial by courtroom failed. It&#39;s time to “start taking down names and kicking ass,” said Republican Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama.<br/><br/>Criminals pardoned by Trump, among them Roger Stone and Michael Flynn, came forward at rallies on the eve of the attack to tell the crowds they were fighting a battle between good and evil and they were on the side of good. On Capitol Hill, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri gave a clenched-fist salute to the hordes outside the Capitol as he pulled up to press his challenge of the election results.<br/><br/>The crowd was pumped. Until a little after 2 p.m., Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was at the helm for the final minutes of decorum in partnership with Pence, who was serving his ceremonial role presiding over the process.<br/><br/>Both men had backed Trump&#39;s agenda and excused or ignored his provocations for four years, but now had no mechanism or will to subvert the election won by Biden. That placed them high among the insurrectionists&#39; targets, no different in the minds of the mob than the “socialists.”<br/><br/>“If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral,&quot; McConnell told his chamber, not long before things spiraled out of control in what lawmakers call the “People’s House.&quot;<br/><br/>___<br/><br/>THE ASSAULT<br/><br/>Thousands had swarmed the Capitol. They charged into police and metal barricades outside the building, shoving and hitting officers in their way. The assault quickly pushed through the vastly outnumbered police line; officers ran down one man and pummeled him.<br/><br/>In the melee outside, near the structure built for Joe Biden’s inauguration on Jan. 20, a man threw a red fire extinguisher at the helmeted head of a police officer. Then he picked up a bullhorn and threw it at officers, too.<br/><br/>The identity of the officer could not immediately be confirmed. But Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who was wounded in the chaos, died the next night; officials say he had been hit in the head with a fire extinguisher.<br/><br/>Shortly after 2 p.m., Capitol Police sent an alert telling workers in a House office building to head to underground transportation tunnels that criss-cross the complex. Minutes later, Pence was taken from the Senate chamber to a secret location and police announced the lockdown of the Capitol. “You may move throughout the building(s) but stay away from exterior windows and doors,” said the email blast. “If you are outside, seek cover.”<br/><br/>At 2:15 p.m., the Senate recessed its Electoral College debate and a voice was heard over the chamber&#39;s audio system: “The protesters are in the building.” The doors of the House chamber were barricaded and lawmakers inside it were told they may need to duck under their chairs or relocate to cloakrooms off the House floor because the mob has breached the Capitol Rotunda.<br/><br/>Even before the mob reached sealed doors of the House chamber, Capitol Police pulled Pelosi away from the podium, she told “60 Minutes.”<br/><br/>“I said, ‘No, I want to be here,’”she said. “And they said, ‘Well, no, you have to leave.’ I said, ‘No, I’m not leaving.&#39; They said, ‘No, you must leave.’” So she did.<br/><br/>At 2:44 p.m., as lawmakers inside the House chamber prepared to be evacuated, a gunshot was heard from right outside, in the Speaker&#39;s Lobby on the other side of the barricaded doors. That&#39;s when Ashli Babbit, wearing a Trump flag like a cape, was shot to death on camera as insurrectionists railed, her blood pooling on the white marble floor.<br/><br/>The Air Force veteran from California had climbed through a broken window into the Speaker’s Lobby before a police officer&#39;s gunshot felled her.<br/><br/>Back in the House chamber, a woman in the balcony was seen and heard screaming. Why she was doing that only became clear later when video circulated. She was screaming a prayer.<br/><br/>Within about 10 minutes of the shooting, House lawmakers and staff members who had been cowering during the onslaught, terror etched into their faces, had been taken from the chamber and gallery to a secure room. The mob broke into Pelosi&#39;s offices while members of her staff hid in one of the rooms of her suite.<br/><br/>“The staff went under the table barricaded the door, turned out the lights, and were silent in the dark,” she said. “Under the table for two and a half hours.”<br/><br/>On the Senate side, Capitol Police had circled the chamber and ordered all staff and reporters and any nearby senators into the chamber and locked it down. At one point about 200 people were inside; an officer armed with what appeared to be a semi-automatic weapon stood between McConnell and the Democratic leader, Sen. Chuck Schumer.<br/><br/>Authorities then ordered an evacuation and rushed everyone inside to a secure location, the Senate parliamentary staff scooping up the boxes holding the Electoral Collage certificates.<br/><br/>Although the Capitol&#39;s attackers had been sent with Trump&#39;s exhortation to fight, they appeared in some cases to be surprised that they had actually made it in.<br/><br/>When they breached the abandoned Senate chamber, they milled around, rummaged through papers, sat at desks and took videos and pictures. One of them climbed to the dais and yelled, “Trump won that election!” Two others were photographed carrying flex cuffs typically used for mass arrests.<br/><br/>But outside the chamber, the mob&#39;s hunt was still on for lawmakers. “Where are they?&quot; people could be heard yelling.<br/><br/>That question could have also applied to reinforcements — where were they?<br/><br/>At about 5:30 p.m., once the National Guard had arrived to supplement the overwhelmed Capitol Police force, a full-on effort began to get the attackers out.<br/><br/>Heavily armed officers brought in as reinforcements started using tear gas in a coordinated fashion to get people moving toward the door, then combed the halls for stragglers. As darkness fell, they pushed the mob farther out onto the plaza and lawn, using officers in riot gear in full shields and clouds of tear gas, flash-bangs and percussion grenades.<br/><br/>At 7:23 p.m., officials announced that people hunkered down in two nearby congressional office buildings could leave “if anyone must.”<br/><br/>Within the hour, the Senate had resumed its work and the House followed, returning the People&#39;s House to the control of the people&#39;s representatives. Lawmakers affirmed Biden’s election victory early the next morning, shell-shocked by the catastrophic failure of security.<br/><br/>Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Ca., told AP on Sunday it was as if Capitol Police “were naked” against the attackers. “It turns out it was the worst kind of non-security anybody could ever imagine.”<br/><br/>Said McGovern: “I was in such disbelief this could possibly happen. These domestic terrorists were in the People’s House, desecrating the People’s House, destroying the People’s House.”<br/><br/><br/><i>Associated Press writers Dustin Weaver in Washington and Michael Casey in Concord, New Hampshire, contributed to this report.

Article,Baker Will Send 500 National Guard To D.C. For Inauguration,Baker Will Send 500 National Guard To D.C. For Inauguration,"Massachusetts will deploy up to 500 National Guard personnel to Washington, D.C., to protect the capital city during the days leading up to President-elect Joe Biden&#39;s inauguration, Gov. Charlie Baker announced on Thursday.<br/><br/>The Executive Office of Public Safety and Security said in a statement the deployment will begin in the next few days. The governor also activated another 500 guardsmen to protect Massachusetts &quot;out of an abundance of caution&quot; and to support local law enforcement over the next week, though &quot;the Administration is not aware of any specific threats to Massachusetts at this time,&quot; the statement added.<br/><br/>The announcement that Massachusetts troops will be deployed this week came during a wide ranging press conference in which the governor also addressed the climate change bill that recently passed the legislature, discussed a new grant program to help small business weather the economic downturn brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and answered questions about his role in the future of the Republican party.<br/><br/>Baker was asked if he intends to take on a larger national role to advocate for more moderation within the GOP as his party rebuilds after President Donald Trump leaves office next week.<br/><br/>&quot;If I can be helpful in a larger conversation about what I think of is the right way to play this so-called game, I&#39;m happy to do that. But I don&#39;t want anybody to walk away thinking that I would ever use this position to leverage something else,&quot; Baker said, reiterating that he intends to serve out his full term ending in 2023.<br/><br/>More immediately, Baker is contending with a climate change bill to drastically reduce the state&#39;s carbon emissions to &quot;net zero&quot; by 2050, meaning the state would switch to enough clean energy sources to cancel out green house gas emissions over the next three decades. The bill sets pathways for several industrial sectors, from housing and transportation to manufacturing and retail, to cut energy use, introduce clean fuels and electrify systems that currently burn natural gas and other carbon-emitting gases.<br/><br/>Baker said Thursday he&#39;s concerned higher environmental standards in the state building code, as proposed in the bill, would raise the cost of building construction and hobble his effort to combat the housing crisis. Baker said aspects of the bill lawmakers passed at the end of their two-year session &quot;literally may just stop in its tracks any housing development in the Commonwealth.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;While we support many elements of that bill and have worked collaboratively with the folks in the Legislature on numerous climate initiatives, which is part of the reason why we&#39;re a national leader on this stuff, we&#39;ve got to build more housing that&#39;s less expensive, not less housing that&#39;s more expensive,&quot; Baker said.<br/><br/>The legislation will expire if Baker doesn&#39;t take action on it. Senate President Karen Spilka and House Speaker Ron Mariano have vowed to refile the bill, send it back to Baker&#39;s desk and override his veto if necessary.<br/><br/>&quot;I think there is a desire and a necessity to continue to move forward the bill that we passed at the end of the session last, last session, last week, &quot; House Ways and Means Chairman Aaron Michlewitz told GBH News.<br/><br/>Baker was visiting Ristorante Saraceno, a restaurant in Michlewitz&#39;s North End district, to announce another round of grants for small businesses suffering during the pandemic. The grant program will offer $78.5 million in direct support to retailers, indoor entertainment venues, eateries and other businesses that have lost revenue over the past year. <br/><br/>Baker said the grants can be used to pay rent, utility bills, mortgages, staff payroll and to replace supplies businesses can no longer use.<br/><br/>&quot;We know how important it is to get small businesses up and running and to help them work their way through this last turn of the pandemic and to make sure that by the time we get to the spring, they&#39;re still with us,&quot; Baker said.<br/><br/>The grant program will offer $78.5 million in direct support to retailers, indoor entertainment venues, eateries and other businesses hit hard by the pandemic. Baker said the grants can be used to pay rent, utility bills, mortgages, staff payroll and to replace supplies businesses can no longer use.<br/><br/>To date, the grant program has given out $195 million to over 4,100 small businesses. The grants are part of the $668 million COVID-19 Small Business Grant Program administered by the quasi-public financing agency Massachusetts Growth Capital Corporation.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>&quot;We will be sending guard personnel to Washington, D.C. as part of the force that they&#39;re putting together for the inaugural activities,&quot; Baker said Thursday.<br/><br/>A spokesman for the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security wrote in a statement the deployment will begin in the next few days. The statement said Gov. Baker approved the request by the federal government and National Guard Bureau to back up the D.C. National Guard.<br/><br/>&quot;This has been a lot of back and forth over the past 48 hours between between the guard here, the guard in D.C. and in some of our colleagues in local and state law enforcement here,&quot; Baker said before the deployment was formally announced.<br/><br/>Baker also activated another 500 guardsmen to protect Massachusetts &quot;out of an abundance of caution&quot; and to support local law enforcement over the next week, according to the spokesman.<br/><br/>&quot;The Administration is not aware of any specific threats to Massachusetts at this time and continues to work with partner agencies to maintain the multi-layered security plans in place to protect residents and centers of government,&quot; the statement said.<br/><br/>On Beacon Hill, House and Senate lawmakers will have to refile a bill to drastically reduce the state&#39;s carbon emissions unless Baker has a change of heart over the legislation that will expire without his signature at the end of the day Thursday.<br/><br/>Baker said Thursday he&#39;s concerned higher environmental standards in the state building code, as proposed in the bill, would raise the cost of building construction and hobble his effort to combat the housing crisis.

Article,Vice President Harris: A New Chapter Opens In US Politics,Vice President Harris: A New Chapter Opens In US Politics,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris broke the barrier Wednesday that has kept men at the top ranks of American power for more than two centuries when she took the oath to hold the nation&#39;s second-highest office.<br/><br/>Harris was sworn in as the first female vice president — and the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to hold the position — in front of the U.S. Capitol by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor.<br/><br/>The moment was steeped in history and significance in more ways than one. She was escorted to the podium by Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman, the officer who single-handedly took on a mob of Trump supporters as they tried to breach the Senate floor during the Capitol insurrection that sought to overturn the election results. Harris was wearing clothes from two young, emerging Black designers — a deep purple dress and coat.<br/><br/>After taking the oath of office, a beaming Harris hugged her husband, Douglas Emhoff, and gave President Joe Biden a first bump.<br/><br/>Her rise is historic in any context, another moment when a stubborn boundary falls away, expanding the idea of what&#39;s possible in American politics. But it&#39;s particularly meaningful because Harris is taking office at a moment of deep consequence, with Americans grappling over the role of institutional racism and confronting a pandemic that has disproportionately devastated Black and brown communities.<br/><br/>Those close to Harris say she&#39;ll bring an important — and often missing — perspective in the debates on how to overcome the many hurdles facing the new administration.<br/><br/>“In many folks&#39; lifetimes, we experienced a segregated United States,&quot; said Lateefah Simon, a civil rights advocate and longtime Harris friend and mentee. “You will now have a Black woman who will walk into the White House not as a guest but as a second in command of the free world.&quot;<br/><br/>Harris — the child of immigrants, a stepmother of two and the wife of a Jewish man — “carries an intersectional story of so many Americans who are never seen and heard.&quot;<br/><br/>Harris, 56, moves into the vice presidency just four years after she first came to Washington as a senator from California, where she&#39;d served as attorney general and as San Francisco&#39;s district attorney. She had expected to work with a White House run by Hillary Clinton, but President Donald Trump&#39;s victory quickly scrambled the nation&#39;s capital and set the stage for the rise of a new class of Democratic stars.<br/><br/>After Harris&#39; own presidential bid fizzled, her rise continued when Biden chose her as his running mate last August. Harris had been a close friend of Beau Biden, the elder son of Joe Biden and a former Delaware attorney general who died in 2015 of cancer.<br/><br/>The inauguration activities included nods to her history-making role and her personal story.<br/><br/>Harris used two Bibles to take the oath, one that belonged to Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, the late civil rights icon whom Harris often cites as inspiration, and Regina Shelton, who helped raise Harris during her childhood in the San Francisco Bay Area. The drumline from Harris&#39; alma mater, Howard University, joined the presidential escort.<br/><br/>To mark the occasion, the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, the nation’s oldest sorority for Black women, which Harris joined at Howard University, declared Wednesday as Soror Kamala D. Harris Day.<br/><br/>“This event will certainly be a momentous occasion that will go down in the annals of our archives as one of the greatest days the founders’ of Alpha Kappa Alpha could have envisioned,” said Dr. Glenda Glover, the sorority’s international president and chief executive office.<br/><br/>She&#39;ll address the nation later in front of the Lincoln Memorial, a symbolic choice as the nation endures one of its most divided stretches since the Civil War.<br/><br/>Biden, in his inaugural address, reflected on the 1913 march for women&#39;s suffrage the day before President Woodrow Wilson&#39;s inauguration, during which some marchers were heckled and attacked.<br/><br/>“Today, we mark the swearing in of the first woman in American history elected to national office, Vice President Kamala Harris. Don&#39;t tell me things can&#39;t change,&quot; Biden said.<br/><br/>Harris has often reflected on her rise through politics by recalling the lessons of her mother, who taught her to take on a larger cause and push through adversity.<br/><br/>“I was raised to not hear ‘no.’ Let me be clear about it. So it wasn’t like, “Oh, the possibilities are immense. Whatever you want to do, you can do,&#39;&quot; she recalled during a “CBS Sunday Morning” interview that aired Sunday. “No, I was raised to understand many people will tell you, ‘It is impossible,’ but don’t listen.&#39;&quot;<br/><br/>Harris&#39; swearing-in holds more symbolic weight than that of any vice president in modern times.<br/><br/>She will expand the definition of who gets to hold power in American politics, said Martha S. Jones, a professor of history at Johns Hopkins University and the author of “Vanguard: How Black Women Broke Barriers, Won the Vote, and Insisted on Equality for All.&quot;<br/><br/>People who want to understand Harris and connect with her will have to learn what it means to graduate from a historically Black college and university rather than an Ivy League school. They will have to understand Harris&#39; traditions, like the Hindu celebration of Diwali, Jones said.<br/><br/>“Folks are going to have to adapt to her rather than her adapting to them,” Jones said.<br/><br/>Her election to the vice presidency should be just the beginning of putting Black women in leadership positions, Jones said, particularly after the role Black women played in organizing and turning out voters in the November election.<br/><br/>“We will all learn what happens to the kind of capacities and insights of Black women in politics when those capacities and insights are permitted to lead,” Jones said.<br/><br/><i>Ronayne reported from Sacramento, Calif.</i>",Kathleen Ronayne and Alexandra Jaffe | Associated Press,Wed Jan 20 12:52:29 EST 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,'Just Move On': Republicans Grapple With Post-Trump Future,'Just Move On': Republicans Grapple With Post-Trump Future,"For the first time in more than a decade, Republicans are waking up to a Washington where Democrats control the White House and Congress, adjusting to an era of diminished power, deep uncertainty and internal feuding.<br/><br/>The shift to minority status is always difficult, prompting debates over who is to blame for losing the last election. But the process is especially intense as Republicans confront profound questions about what the party stands for <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/ad718c0048c341d0044c4709fb23c8dd"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; text-decoration: none; background-color: transparent; font-size: inherit; cursor: pointer; color: rgb(28, 167, 218); font-family: &quot;AP Serif&quot;; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;"">without Donald Trump in charge</a>.<br/><br/>Over the past four years, the GOP&#39;s values were inexorably tied to the whims of a president who regularly undermined democratic institutions and traded the party&#39;s long-standing commitment to fiscal discipline, strong foreign policy and the rule of law for a brash and inconsistent populism. The party now faces a decision about whether to keep moving in that direction, as many of Trump&#39;s most loyal supporters demand, or chart a new course.<br/><br/>Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, one of the few Republican elected officials who regularly condemned Trumpism, evoked President Ronald Reagan in calling this moment “a time for choosing.”<br/><br/>“We have to decide if we’re going to continue heading down the direction of Donald Trump or if we’re going to return to our roots,” Hogan, a potential 2024 White House contender, said in an interview.<br/><br/>“The party would be much better off if they were to purge themselves of Donald Trump,” he added. “But I don’t think there’s any hope of him completely going away.”<br/><br/>Whether the party moves on may come down to what Republicans such as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz do next.<br/><br/>Cruz spent weeks parroting <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-trump-bogus-election-claims-3d34646b34316d2f96f9ae5a267a3303"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; text-decoration: none; background-color: transparent; font-size: inherit; cursor: pointer; color: rgb(28, 167, 218); font-family: &quot;AP Serif&quot;; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;"">Trump&#39;s baseless claims of election fraud</a>, which helped incite <a href=""https://apnews.com/hub/capitol-siege"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; text-decoration: none; background-color: transparent; font-size: inherit; cursor: pointer; color: rgb(28, 167, 218); font-family: &quot;AP Serif&quot;; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;"">the deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol</a>. Republican elections officials in several battleground states that President Joe Biden carried have said the election was fair. Trump’s claims were roundly rejected in the courts, including by judges appointed by Trump.<br/><br/>Cruz on Wednesday acknowledged Biden&#39;s victory but refused, when pressed, to describe it as legitimate.<br/><br/>“He won the election. He is the president. I just came from his inauguration,” Cruz said in an interview.<br/><br/>Looking forward, Cruz said Trump would remain a significant part of the political conversation, but that the Republican Party should move away from divisive “language and tone and rhetoric” that alienated suburban voters, particularly women, in recent elections.<br/><br/>“President Trump surely will continue to make his views known, and they’ll continue to have a real impact, but I think the country going forward wants policies that work, and I think as a party, we need to do a better job winning hearts and minds,” said Cruz, who is also considering a White House run.<br/><br/>In the wake of the Capitol riot Jan. 6, a small but notable faction of high-profile Republicans is taking a stronger stance against Trump or seeking distance from him.<br/><br/>The Senate’s top Republican, Mitch McConnell, said on the eve of the inauguration that the pro-Trump mob that stormed the Capitol was “provoked by the president.” Even Mike Pence, Trump&#39;s vice president and long considered his most devoted cheerleader, skipped Trump’s departure ceremony to attend Biden’s inauguration.<br/><br/>Trump has retreated to his South Florida club, where he has retained a small group of former White House aides who will work out of a two-story guest house on the Mar-a-Lago grounds. In addition to advisers in Washington, Trump will have access to a well-funded political action committee, the Save America PAC, that is likely to inherit tens of millions of dollars in donations that flooded his campaign coffers after his election loss.<br/><br/>Those close to Trump believe he will lay low in the immediate future as he focuses on his upcoming impeachment trial for inciting the riot. After that, he is expected to reemerge, likely granting media interviews and finding a new home on social media after losing his powerful Twitter bullhorn.<br/><br/>While his plans are just taking shape, Trump is expected to remain politically active, including trying to exact revenge by backing primary challenges against Republicans he believed scorned him in his final days. He continues to leave the door open to another presidential run in 2024. Some friends believe he might even flirt with running as a third-party candidate, which would badly splinter an already fractured GOP.<br/><br/>Trump issued an ominous vow as he left the White House for the last time as president: “We will be back in some form.&quot;<br/><br/>Many in the GOP’s die-hard base continue to promote conspiracy theories, embrace white nationalism and, above all, revere Trump’s voice as gospel.<br/><br/>Trump loyalists in states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wyoming expressed outrage and disappointment in the 10 Republicans who voted with Democrats to <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/trump-impeachment-vote-capitol-siege-0a6f2a348a6e43f27d5e1dc486027860"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; text-decoration: none; background-color: transparent; font-size: inherit; cursor: pointer; color: rgb(28, 167, 218); font-family: &quot;AP Serif&quot;; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;"">impeach Trump</a> last week. One of them, Michigan Rep. Pete Meijer, said he bought body armor to protect himself from a wave of threats from Trump supporters.<br/><br/>In Wyoming, state GOP Chairman Frank Eathorne raised the possibility of secession this week and criticized Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, another Republican who backed Trump&#39;s impeachment.<br/><br/>“The Republican National Committee views President Trump as our party leader into the future. ... The (state party) agrees,” Eathorne said, noting that Trump “represents the timeless principles” that the state and national GOP stand for.<br/><br/>Trump left office with a 34% approval rating, according to Gallup — the lowest of his presidency — but the overwhelming majority of Republicans, 82%, approved of his job performance. Even as some try to move on, Trump&#39;s continued popularity with the GOP&#39;s base ensures he will remain a political force.<br/><br/>Despite the GOP&#39;s many challenges, they&#39;re within reach of retaking one or both chambers of Congress in next year&#39;s midterm elections. Since the 2006 midterms, the party in the White House has lost on average 37 House seats. Currently, Democrats hold a 10-seat House majority and they’re tied with Republicans in the Senate.<br/><br/>Hogan, the Maryland governor, said that the GOP may be at one of its lowest points ever, but noted that Reagan reclaimed the White House for Republicans just six years after President Richard Nixon was forced to resign in disgrace.<br/><br/>“Obviously, (Trump) still has got a lock on a pretty good chunk of the Republican base, but there are an awful lot of people that were afraid to speak out for four years — unlike me —who are now starting to speak out,&quot; Hogan said.<br/><br/>Still, there are plenty of hurdles ahead. Primary challenges could leave the party with congressional nominees next year who are even further to the right, potentially imperiling the GOP&#39;s grip on races they might otherwise win.<br/><br/>More immediately, Senate Republicans, including McConnell, are wrestling with whether to convict Trump of high crimes and misdemeanors as outlined in last week&#39;s House impeachment. The Senate could ultimately vote to ban Trump from ever holding office again.<br/><br/>“I hope that Republicans won’t participate in this petty, vindictive, final attack directed at President Trump,” Cruz said. “We should just move on.”<br/><br/><i>Associated Press writers Jill Colvin in West Palm Beach, Florida, and Mead Gruver in Cheyenne, Wyoming, contributed to this report.</i>",Steve Peoples | Associated Press,Thu Jan 21 11:56:48 EST 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I normally don’t sleep that way, but it makes sense if you are waking up in pain.”<br/><br/>Beauregard also has to take 21 pills a day, watch what she eats and check her weight and blood pressure constantly. <br/><br/>She thought this lifestyle might be nearing its end: Her doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital told her she’d get a transplant in three to four years. It’s been more than four. <br/><br/>“You’re not in the marathon for 26 miles — maybe it will be 35 miles and then you get to 30 miles and maybe it will be 50 miles, just keep running,” she said. <br/><br/>Under the current policy, donor kidneys stay within <a href=""https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/members/regions/"" target=""_blank"">11 local regions</a> around the country. But the new policy will allocate kidneys up to 250 nautical miles from a donor hospital, which will place New York City in the New England donor area. <br/><br/>Since allocation is heavily based on how long a patient <a href=""https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/learn/about-transplantation/how-organ-allocation-works/"" target=""_blank"">has been waiting</a> and New York has a lot more people who’ve waited much longer for a kidney, medical experts predict that New York City patients will likely scoop up most available donor kidneys in this region. <br/><br/>Many transplant doctors in Boston expect to have to tell patients like Beauregard that the wait will be longer. Melissa Parente, executive director of surgery at Tufts Medical Center, said a test simulation applying the new policy to local organs showed that will likely be the case.<br/><br/>“Many, many, many of them [organs] were leaving for New York, New Jersey. And so patients that are at organ transplant centers in New England were much further down the list than we would normally see them,” she said.<br/><br/>Parente thinks policymakers overlooked some major geographic challenges.<br/><br/>“It’s a bit of a uniformed policy, although the country is not uniform,” she said. “So New England is surrounded by the ocean, which makes us a little bit different than somewhere in the midwest. The 250 nautical miles if you are in the middle of the country means that you truly do get 250 nautical miles. But obviously, for us, we are not getting donors out of the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.”<br/><br/>With the global pandemic already slowing things down, Beauregard thinks that adding a new policy in the midst of all this that will likely add wait time is frustrating.<br/><br/>&quot;People that are in a situation like me, and they have other medical issues too, how long can they bear that?” she said.<br/><br/>But many have argued for years that the current system is unfair. The availability of donor organs in the 11 regions varies widely depending on how many patients suffer from kidney disease, how many are on the transplant list and how many donor organs are recovered.<br/><br/>The United Network for Organ Sharing, the nonprofit organization that manages national organ distribution, is hoping this new policy will address these <a href=""https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/governance/public-comment/eliminate-the-use-of-dsa-and-region-in-kidney-allocation-policy/"" target=""_blank"">geographic inequities</a>. <br/><br/>“In the current system, we have artificial boundaries constructed that have led to an imbalance of organs across the country,&quot; said Dr. Vince Casingal, who chairs the group’s kidney committee. &quot;This unfairness is seen based on how long someone waits, potentially just down the road from someone else.&quot;<br/><br/>The goal is that over the next few years, wait times across the country will be the same.<br/><br/>There are 57 government contracted Organ Procurement Organizations who are tasked with recovering donated organs and pairing them with patients. Under this new policy, some OPOs will benefit from it and others will suffer like the one in New England. <br/><br/>“We want to serve the patients that are waiting, wherever they are,” said Alexandra Glazier, CEO of the New England Donor Services, the OPO that serves Massachusetts. “So we try to take a nationwide view of allocation policy and recognize that change is needed and can be painful. Hopefully the end result is of value to patients everywhere.”<br/><br/>But others worry that under this new policy, this goal won’t ever be achieved because the non-profit agencies that procure organs are all very different. The one in New York City, for example, has nearly lost its contract for poor performance numerous times. <br/><br/>If OPOs aren’t all performing the same, it’s like a school project where one group does 90% of the work, another does 10% and the underperforming group gets the “A,” said Dr. Jay Fishman, the associate director of the transplant center at Massachusetts General Hospital.<br/><br/>“I have friends and colleagues in New York,&quot; Fishman said. &quot;What they are saying is that I don’t have enough organs for my patients. And they are right. Organs are supposed to be a national resource. But to make it fair, everyone has to work equally well.”<br/><br/>Until these inequities in productivity are fixed, not much will change, said Greg Segal, who co-founded the advocacy group Organize after watching his dad wait five years for a heart transplant. <br/><br/>“The underlying structural problem is that OPOs are so grossly inefficient that we have been unnecessarily constraining the supply and then getting in fist fights about who should access that supply,” Segal said. “OPO reform is going to address the overall problem, and that’s where I wish policymakers would spend more of their time.”<br/><br/>Many also think expanding the geographic area for kidney distribution will add even more logistical issues to an already extremely complicated process, especially during a global pandemic, possibly resulting in more lost organs.<br/><br/>Everyone agrees, though, that with 13 people dying every day waiting for a kidney, there isn’t an easy solution to allocation. Changing distribution doesn’t add any organs to the nation’s severe shortage. <br/><br/>Julianne Beauregard knows this statistic firsthand. She has lost several family members to kidney disease. She worries that the new policy will only make matters worse.<br/><br/>“You really don’t know what can occur in six months, a year, two years extra,&quot; she said. &quot;For a lot of people, they unfortunately won’t make it. That’s a horrible feeling to have just so that you can make it, in theory, more equitable for people down the road.”<br/><br/>An ongoing lawsuit seeks to postpone the new policy until the pandemic is over.",Paige Sutherland,Thu Feb 04 05:00:14 EST 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Offers Shorter Sentences To Inmates In Exchange For COVID-19 Shot,"<b><i>UPDATE: Gov. Charlie Baker has rescinded this program because it &quot;is not consistent with the administration’s policies regarding reduced prison terms,&quot; according to Executive Office of Public Safety and Security spokesperson Jake Wark.</i></b><br/><br/>Hoping to increase the number of incarcerated people vaccinated against COVID-19, the state Department of Corrections is offering a deal: One week’s reduced sentence in exchange for getting vaccinated. <br/><br/>The offer was outlined in a Jan. 28 letter from Commissioner Carol Mici to all DOC prisoners, a copy of which was obtained by GBH News. <br/><br/>A Department of Corrections spokesperson confirmed the letter&#39;s authenticity. <br/><br/>“While we are working together to stifle this virus through “herd immunity,” we are not there yet,” Mici wrote. <br/><br/>Massachusetts is one of eight states that offered the vaccine early in its process to incarnated people. The roll-out began in the prison system mid-January. So far about 3,500 of 6,800 incarcerated people have received their first dose of the vaccine, according to Mici.<br/><br/>Known as “Earned Good Time,” <a class=""Hyperlink SCXW155042055 BCX0"" href=""https://www.mass.gov/info-details/mass-general-laws-c127-ss-129d#section-129d-"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; user-select: text; -webkit-user-drag: none; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; cursor: text; text-decoration: none; color: inherit;"">state law</a> allows prisoners to get sentences deductions by completing a range of tasks, including work and education. <br/><br/>And they now can earn 7.5 days by completing what is referred to in the letter as the “Vaccine Rehabilitation Program.” <br/><br/>“I have determined that receiving the vaccine is significantly valuable to rehabilitation and will therefore be offering Earned Good Time,&quot; Mici wrote. <br/><br/>Inmates must receive two doses of the vaccine and attest, in writing, that they have read and watched educational information about the vaccine to qualify for the program. <br/><br/>A DOC spokesperson said education materials were created with cultural competency in mind and included a recorded video conference with <a class=""Hyperlink SCXW155042055 BCX0"" href=""https://roxburypresbyterianchurch.org/our-pastor/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; user-select: text; -webkit-user-drag: none; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; cursor: text; text-decoration: none; color: inherit;"">Rev. Liz Walker</a>, of Roxbury Presbyterian Church, Harvard Divinity Schools’ Rev. Gloria White Hammond, and infectious disease specialist Dr. Anthony Fauci. <br/><br/>The video conference “specifically addresses potential sources of skepticism that people may have about the vaccine and the medical industry,” the spokesperson said. <br/><br/>The DOC also partnered with Commonwealth Medicine, and colloborated with formerly incarcerated persons, advocates, and health care providers on a series of videos about the vaccine, the spokesperson added. The series is available in English, with open captioned versions in Spanish and Portuguese, according to the spokesperson. <br/><br/>Jessie Rossman, a staff attorney with the ACLU of Massachusetts, said they are cautiously optimistic about the program. <br/><br/>“To the extent that the Department of Correction wants to encourage individuals who are incarcerated in their facilities to get the vaccine, positive reinforcement and positive incentivization is the way to do it,” she said. <br/><br/>Elizabeth Matos, executive director of Prisoners’ Legal Services, said taking the vaccine is a personal medical decision and raised concerns the policy could be “more coercive than necessary.” <br/><br/>“Of course we want conditions to improve and want people to be safe, but we don&#39;t think that incarcerated people should be stripped of their agency to choose, which other people are able to do who are not incarcerated,” Matos said. <br/><br/>Additionally, she said the program penalizes those who have a &quot;contraindications,” such as an allergic reaction, and need to decline the vaccine. <br/><br/>The <a class=""Hyperlink SCXW155042055 BCX0"" href=""https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; user-select: text; -webkit-user-drag: none; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; cursor: text; text-decoration: none; color: inherit;"">CDC warns against</a> receiving a second dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines if a patient had a severe reaction to their first dose. <br/><br/>Matos suggested the state should consider awarding the 7.5 day credit to any incarcerated individuals who complete the education requirement. <br/>",Carrie Saldo,Wed Feb 03 10:29:00 EST 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,"George P. Shultz, Longtime Reagan Secretary Of State, Dies At 100","George P. Shultz, Longtime Reagan Secretary Of State, Dies At 100","Former Secretary of State George P. Shultz, a titan of American academia, business and diplomacy who spent most of the 1980s trying to improve Cold War relations with the Soviet Union and forging a course for peace in the Middle East, has died. He was 100.<br/><br/>Schultz died Saturday at his home on the campus of Stanford University, where he was a distinguished fellow at the Hoover Institution, a think tank, and professor emeritus at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business.<br/><br/>The Hoover Institution announced Schultz’s death on Sunday. A cause of death was not provided.<br/><br/>A lifelong Republican, Shultz held three major Cabinet positions in GOP administrations during a lengthy career of public service.<br/><br/>He was labor secretary, treasury secretary and director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Richard M. Nixon before spending more than six years as President Ronald Reagan’s secretary of state.<br/><br/>Schultz was the longest serving secretary of state since World War II and had been the oldest surviving former Cabinet member of any administration.<br/><br/>Condoleezza Rice, also a former secretary of state and current director of the Hoover Institution, praised Schultz as a “great American statesman” and a “true patriot.”<br/><br/>&quot;He will be remembered in history as a man who made the world a better place,” she said in statement.<br/><br/>Shultz had largely stayed out of politics since his retirement, but had been an advocate for an increased focus on climate change. He marked his 100th birthday in December by extolling the virtues of trust and bipartisanship in politics and other endeavors in a piece he wrote for The Washington Post.<br/><br/>Coming amid the acrimony that followed the November presidential election, Shultz’s call for decency and respect for opposing views struck many as an appeal for the country to shun the political vitriol of the Trump years.<br/><br/>“Trust is the coin of the realm,” Shultz wrote. “When trust was in the room, whatever room that was -- the family room, the schoolroom, the locker room, the office room, the government room or the military room -- good things happened. When trust was not in the room, good things did not happen. Everything else is details.”<br/><br/>Over his lifetime, Shultz succeeded in the worlds of academia, public service and corporate America, and was widely respected by his peers from both political parties.<br/><br/>After the October 1983 bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut that killed 241 soldiers, Shultz worked tirelessly to end Lebanon’s brutal civil war in the 1980s. He spent countless hours of shuttle diplomacy between Mideast capitals trying to secure the withdrawal of Israeli forces there.<br/><br/>The experience led him to believe that stability in the region could only be assured with a settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and he set about on an ambitious but ultimately unsuccessful mission to bring the parties to the negotiating table.<br/><br/>Although Shultz fell short of his goal to put the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel on a course to a peace agreement, he shaped the path for future administrations’ Mideast efforts by legitimizing the Palestinians as a people with valid aspirations and a valid stake in determining their future.<br/><br/>As the nation’s chief diplomat, Shultz negotiated the first-ever treaty to reduce the size of the Soviet Union’s ground-based nuclear arsenals despite fierce objections from Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to Reagan’s “Strategic Defense Initiative” or Star Wars.<br/><br/>The 1987 Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty was a historic attempt to begin to reverse the nuclear arms race, a goal he never abandoned in private life.<br/><br/>“Now that we know so much about these weapons and their power,” Shultz said in an interview in 2008, “they’re almost weapons that we wouldn’t use, so I think we would be better off without them.”<br/><br/>Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, reflecting in his memoirs on the “highly analytic, calm and unselfish Shultz,” paid Shultz an exceptional compliment in his diary: “If I could choose one American to whom I would entrust the nation’s fate in a crisis, it would be George Shultz.”<br/><br/>George Pratt Shultz was born Dec. 13, 1920, in New York City and raised in Englewood, New Jersey. He studied economics and public and international affairs at Princeton University, graduating in 1942. His affinity for Princeton prompted him to have the school’s mascot, a tiger, tattooed on his posterior, a fact confirmed to reporters decades later by his wife aboard a plane taking them to China.<br/><br/>At Shultz’s 90th birthday party, his successor as secretary of state, James Baker, joked that he would do anything for Shultz “except kiss the tiger.” After Princeton, Shultz joined the Marine Corps and rose to the rank of captain as an artillery officer during World War II.<br/><br/>He earned a Ph.D. in economics at MIT in 1949 and taught at MIT and at the University of Chicago, where he was dean of the business school. His administration experience included a stint as a senior staff economist with President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s Council of Economic Advisers and as Nixon’s OMB director.<br/><br/>Shultz was president of the construction and engineering company Bechtel Group from 1975-1982 and taught part-time at Stanford University before joining the Reagan administration in 1982, replacing Alexander Haig, who resigned after frequent clashes with other members of the administration.<br/><br/>A rare public disagreement between Reagan and Shultz came in 1985 when the president ordered thousands of government employees with access to highly classified information to take a “lie detector” test as a way to plug leaks of information. Shultz told reporters, “The minute in this government that I am not trusted is the day that I leave.” The administration soon backed off the demand.<br/><br/>A year later, Shultz submitted to a government-wide drug test considered far more reliable.<br/><br/>A more serious disagreement was over the secret arms sales to Iran in 1985 in hopes of securing the release of American hostages held in Lebanon by Hezbollah militants. Although Shultz objected, Reagan went ahead with the deal and millions of dollars from Iran went to right-wing Contra guerrillas in Nicaragua. The ensuing Iran-Contra scandal swamped the administration, to Shultz’s dismay.<br/><br/>In 1986 testimony to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, he lamented that “nothing ever gets settled in this town. It’s not like running a company or even a university. It’s a seething debating society in which the debate never stops, in which people never give up, including me, and that’s the atmosphere in which you administer.″<br/><br/>After Reagan left office, Shultz returned to Bechtel, having been the longest serving secretary of state since Cordell Hull under President Franklin D. Roosevelt.<br/><br/>He retired from Bechtel’s board in 2006 and returned to Stanford and the Hoover Institution.<br/><br/>In 2000, he became an early supporter of the presidential candidacy of George W. Bush, whose father had been vice president while Shultz was secretary of state. Schultz served as an informal adviser to the campaign.<br/><br/>Shultz remained an ardent arms control advocate in his later years but retained an iconoclastic streak, speaking out against several mainstream Republican policy positions. He created some controversy by calling the war on recreational drugs, championed by Reagan, a failure and raised eyebrows by decrying the longstanding U.S. embargo on Cuba as “insane.”<br/><br/>He was also a prominent proponent of efforts to fight the effects of climate change, warning that ignoring the risks was suicidal.<br/><br/>A pragmatist, Shultz, along with former GOP Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, made headlines during the 2016 presidential campaign when he declined to endorse Republican nominee Donald Trump after being quoted as saying “God help us” when asked about the possibility of Trump in the White House.<br/><br/>Shultz was married to Helena “Obie” O’Brien, an Army nurse he met in the Pacific in World War II, and they had five children. After her death, in 1995, he married Charlotte Maillard, San Francisco’s protocol chief, in 1997.<br/><br/>Shultz was awarded the nation’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 1989.<br/><br/>Survivors include his wife, five children, 11 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.<br/><br/>Funeral arrangements were not immediately announced.<br/><br/><i>Longtime AP Diplomatic Writer Barry Schweid, who died in 2015, contributed to this report.</i>",Matthew Lee | Associated Press,Sun Feb 07 13:53:40 EST 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,"Ropeless Fishing Shows Promise, But There’s a Catch: Financial, Safety, Technology Challenges","Ropeless Fishing Shows Promise, But There’s a Catch: Financial, Safety, Technology Challenges","The lobster industry could be getting a new sound. <br/><br/>On a cold January morning, a lobster trap sitting on a table at a manufacturing facility in Wareham is rhythmically beeping. Two final beeps have a special meaning.<br/><br/>“So that&#39;s the release confirmation,” explained Rob Morris, who sells acoustic release systems for the underwater technology company EdgeTech.<br/><br/>With this technology, lobstermen can send the acoustic signal from a phone app to a trap on the ocean floor. The signal triggers an airbag, with a line attached, to launch up to the surface, allowing the traps to be hauled in. These “ropeless” systems do away with the high number of vertical lines that run from buoys on the surface down to traps on the ocean floor.<br/><br/>Looking at this table, Morris sees the future of the fishery – and many conservationists share that hope. Ropeless fishing eliminates vertical lines in the water column that are blamed for around half of all reported North Atlantic right whale deaths.<br/><br/>But experts say the transition to ropeless is moving too slowly. By the time working gear can get into the boats of thousands of lobstermen across New England, it may be too late to save critically endangered right whales.<br/><br/>It’s being held up by technical, regulatory, and financial factors. <br/><br/>“If you talk to fishermen about ropeless fishing, one of the first questions out of their mouth is, ‘What is this going to cost?,’” said Mark Baumgartner, a marine ecologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and vice chair of the Ropeless Consortium. “To me, it&#39;s a 100 percent legitimate question. If this gear is going to be prohibitively expensive to them, adopting ropeless is essentially closing the fishery.”<br/><br/>Current EdgeTech systems could cost anywhere from $7,500 for one line of traps to $70,000 for a boat’s total gear conversion, according to Morris. Economies of scale are expected bring that down, but even so, it’s out of reach for nearly all fishermen.<br/><br/>Government funding will be essential, said Erica Fuller, a senior attorney with the Conservation Law Foundation.<br/><br/>“Our hope is that in the Biden administration, the urgency of right whales will translate to urgency in getting some of this funding available,” she said.<br/><br/>With funding, scientists and engineers can also resolve technical issues more quickly, particularly around gear marking.<br/><br/>“The gear location marking part of this is the ‘rate-limiting step,’” Baumgartner said. “It’s the thing that&#39;s keeping us from moving forward to some kind of commercial adoption.”<br/><br/>Gear marking apps do the job that buoys once did: they’re a visual cue so fishermen know where traps are located on the seafloor.<br/><br/>Currently, each of the handful of ropeless gear manufacturers uses its own app to mark the location of traps, and their apps don’t talk to one another. If there isn’t a shared system for viewing gear, lobstermen could unknowingly entangle their traps in other fishermen’s gear.<br/><br/>It’s a big sticking point for critics: ropeless technology will not be safe until gear marking is figured out.<br/><br/>“The technology is just like … we’re at the model T today, and people expect us to be at the Tesla tomorrow,” said Beth Casoni, executive director of the Massachusetts Lobstermen’s Association.<br/><br/>The association doesn’t support ropeless technology, at least not until a shared database that will allow fishermen to see traps on the seafloor is created. Manufacturers say they’re working on it. But, Casoni said, there’s still a long way to go to find out whether ropeless technology is viable for mass adoption.<br/><br/>“We need a large-scale, scientific, unbiased feasibility study on the whole thing,” Casoni said. “We need to put five boats out in a big square, fishing ropeless, mobile gear, and see what really happens.”<br/><br/>In Massachusetts, efforts are under way. The state recently announced a 12-month ropeless feasibility study to assess how well ropeless technology works, how to manage enforcement, and how it impacts marine life and the $600 million New England lobster industry.<br/><br/>But Casoni emphasized the hidden hurdle of ropeless technology: if lobstermen perceive that ropeless gear is dangerous, unreliable, or economically impractical, they won’t be willing to use it during closures, let alone during the rest of the year.<br/><br/>Conservationists like Mark Baumgartner are keenly aware of what could happen if these challenges aren’t overcome, and soon.<br/><br/>“The dual problems of the extinction of the right whale and incredibly difficult times – if not the extinction – of the trap fishing industry could be addressed simultaneously with a single solution,” he said, drumming the table to punctuate each word. “If we can get ropeless right.”<br/><br/>Experts say it will take at least five years to know whether ropeless is the answer, and in those five years, the thing that will make a difference is how bad we want it.",Eve Zuckoff,Fri Feb 12 05:00:00 EST 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,Director Of Fitchburg Area's Only Shelter Is Accused Of Assaulting Homeless Clients  ,Director Of Fitchburg Area's Only Shelter Is Accused Of Assaulting Homeless Clients  ,"Advocates for the homeless in the Fitchburg area say there is a problem at Our Father’s House, the region&#39;s only year-round overnight shelter: The director may be preying on the people who go there for help.<br/><br/>At a recent meeting of the Fitchburg Human Rights Commission, several advocates accused Kevin MacLean — the shelter’s director of homelessness  — of physically and sexually assaulting clients. <br/><br/>Tara Rivera, business development officer at Recovery Centers of America, told the commission homeless people in the region are being “violated and threatened and berated and mistreated.” <br/><br/>“If I came to you as a Fitchburg resident, someone that&#39;s gainfully employed and a homeowner in the city and told you half of what I&#39;ve heard from our homeless population has happened at the hands of Kevin, he would be in handcuffs,” said Rivera. <br/><br/>The Fitchburg Police Department is now investigating the allegations and asking anyone with information to contact the department. <br/><br/>But advocates said they’ve appealed to local police, as well as Our Father’s House leadership, and state and federal authorities for at least two years. Those concerns were largely dismissed as hearsay, advocates said, because none of the homeless victims wanted to come forward on their own. Instead the complaints were relayed through case workers or caregivers.<br/><br/>MacLean declined interview requests from GBH News. He referred all questions to Our Father’s House Executive Director Judith Nest-Pasierb, who defended MacLean. <br/><br/>“Certainly, he wants to help people and help homeless people as well,” she said.  <br/><br/>In an interview with GBH News this month, Nest-Pasierb said she had no prior knowledge of the allegations made by advocates. But weeks earlier, in a<a href=""https://www.scribd.com/document/495756486/Addendum-from-Our-Father-s-House-1-18-21?secret_password=nC3Mt7MTS3BDavSdeFx2"" target=""_blank""> Jan. 18 email</a> to the Human Rights Commission obtained by GBH News, she confirmed those allegations had been investigated, and dismissed.<br/><br/>“In this particular case, all accusations were both independently and officially investigated without merit,” Nest-Pasierb wrote. <br/><br/>Asked in the follow-up interview whether MacLean should be placed on leave during the police investigation, Nest-Pasierb said “in our country we&#39;re innocent until proven guilty, period.” <br/><br/>Approximately two years ago, advocates said, they met with Nest-Pasierb who dismissed their concerns. <br/><br/>Susan Buchholz, the coordinator of the Joint Coalition on Health, a grassroots public health and social justice organization, told the commission she has heard the complaints against MacLean from clients, some of which stem back five or six years. <br/><br/>“Tara and I and others and psychological professionals have been working on this for so long and have heard women tell explicitly how they were assaulted,” Buchholz said.<br/><br/>Yvonne Andrews, a mental health provider in Fitchburg, told the commission clients have said that MacLean wields his authority to get “sexual favors” from homeless individuals. <br/><br/>They “feel like they can&#39;t do anything to stand up to Kevin because he&#39;s the only gig in town,” she said. “And he also holds the powerful control factor that makes people feel like no matter where they go, that they will be banned from whatever help they can possibly get.”<br/><br/>Our Father’s House launched an internal investigation about two years ago, according to advocates. <br/><br/>But Jacqueline Buckley, Community Health Connections chief operating officer, told the commission the investigation was “thoroughly pointless.” <br/><br/>“It was not conducted in an objective fashion. And I heard that from people who were interviewed and people that volunteered to be interviewed that were not contacted,” Buckley said. <br/><br/>Asked if that investigation took place, Nest-Pasierb said she couldn’t answer. <br/><br/>“I would highlight an employee&#39;s confidentiality. I would never do that to anyone, any employee,” she said. <br/><br/>Advocates shared email threads confirming their outreach to state and federal agencies and elected leaders. Spokespeople for both the United States Attorney for the district of Massachusetts and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development declined to comment when asked if the agencies had investigated. <br/><br/><b>Investigation underway</b><br/><br/>Fitchburg Police Chief Ernest Martineau said Sgt. Christopher Bellofatto is leading the department&#39;s investigation into the allegations raised in January and encouraged members of the public to reach out. <br/><br/>“If they were a victim of something by Mr. MacLean, they should come bring it to our attention,” Martineau told GBH News. “And I assure you, it will be investigated to the fullest that that we can investigate it.” <br/><br/>Martineau went on to say that Our Father’s House has been a “great partner.”<br/><br/>“It&#39;s not fair to, just with a brush stroke, call Our Father&#39;s House something that they aren&#39;t,&quot; Martineau said. &quot;They&#39;ve been an institution in this city for 40 plus years. I consider them the subject matter experts to homelessness issues.” <br/><br/>Two people said they were turned away by Fitchburg police in July 2018 when they asked to file assault charges against MacLean. <br/>“My son and I did that three years ago and got nowhere,” said Kathleen Couture. “Nowhere.” <br/><br/>Martineau told GBH News the department has no record of Couture, or her son Christopher Cattel Jr., asking to press charges. <br/><br/>Documents provided by Nest-Pasierb to GBH News confirm that there was a physical altercation between MacLean and Cattel. <br/><br/>The two men have different accounts of the skirmish. <br/><br/>Cattel said MacLean assaulted him, inside the shelter, after he questioned staff about his prescription medication. Cattel maintains medication was stolen from him. <br/><br/>“Kevin ran and hit me right in the side of my hip and knocked me on the stairs,” said Cattel, 42, who has had multiple hip replacement surgeries and occasionally walks with a cane. <br/><br/>He added that MacLean ordered a staff member to sit on him until Fitchburg police arrived. <br/><br/>“I believe Kevin&#39;s intent was to hurt me because I was not bowing down to him,” said Cattel. “I was not letting him try and intimidate me and that&#39;s what he thought he was going to be able to do.”  <br/><br/>Cattel said he wasn’t intimidated or seriously injured, although he did have bruising and low back pain following the alleged incident. <br/><br/>In a July 10, 2018 report emailed to Nest-Pasierb, MacLean said Cattel assaulted him after he was told to leave the shelter for “misuse of medication.” <br/><br/>MacLean said Cattel shoved and tried to punch him, but MacLean used “restraint-training” to defend himself. <br/><br/>“I basically put him into a power half-nelson and wrapped my other hand around his head and forced him down to the floor and eventually into the bottom of the second-floor staircase going up,” MacLean wrote. <br/><br/>He asked employee Brian Pelletier to assist with the restraint by holding Cattel’s legs. Maclean asked another staff member to call police and report that he’d been assaulted. <br/><br/>While Cattel was pinned, MacLean said Cattel was “very combative” and tried to bite him. <br/><br/>“I told him if he bit my arm, he may never be able to eat again,” MacLean wrote. <br/><br/>MacLean wrote that police asked if he wanted to press assault charges against Cattel. He declined, and instead asked the police to issue a no trespass order, which can prohibit an individual from entering a property.<br/><br/>Three other staff members signed a statement that said MacLean restrained Cattel because Cattel had been “physically violant [sic] toward staff.” <br/><br/>In an interview with GBH News, Nest-Pasierb said she didn&#39;t recall Cattel or the incident. <br/><br/>“As executive director I oversee the agency. So, I&#39;m not working face to face with clients,” Nest-Pasierb said. “But I can tell you that as a grievance policy, as grievances come to my attention, I never had a grievance from [Cattel] before and was not aware of this before.&quot; <br/><br/>Nest-Pasierb confirmed Our Father’s House uses video surveillance, which she said is limited to common areas of the shelter and “archived for a certain length of time.” <br/><br/>A request to review footage from July 10, 2018 went unanswered by Nest-Pasierb. <br/><br/><b>‘I knew my life was about to change’ </b><br/><br/>MacLean was inspired to work with the homeless years ago while on assignment for a New Hampshire newspaper, <a href=""http://http://www.shelterfromthestormnh.org/Sheltergrams/2017_Sheltergrams/Sheltergram_Dec%202017_Layout%201.pdf"">according to a 2017 newsletter</a> piece he wrote. <br/><br/>“After spending four days, and writing an award-winning article, I knew my life was about to change and would include helping the homeless,” he wrote. “Nine months later I resigned from the paper and spent the next year volunteering at the St. Francis Inn Soup Kitchen, in the Badlands of Philly, as a member of the Franciscan Volunteer Ministry.” <br/><br/>MacLean joined Our Father’s House in March 2010. There, he’s responsible for street outreach and running the emergency shelter, according to his LinkedIn page. <br/><br/>Numerous local newspaper accounts have highlighted MacLean’s work. <br/><br/>One article said he keeps a fund at an area coffee shop so that homeless people in need can use it to buy a warm beverage. Other stories detail MacLean’s work distributing supplies, like blankets, food and toiletries, encouraging use of the emergency shelter, and offering homeless individuals rental assistance. <br/><br/>When working on the streets, Nest-Pasierb said MacLean takes precautions “for his protection and accountability.” For the past two years, MacLean has been accompanied by a police liaison when conducting street outreach in Fitchburg. And he also wears a body camera and has a dashboard camera inside his vehicle, she said. <br/><br/>Nest-Pasierb did not respond to a subsequent question about when and why MacLean began taking video surveillance of his work. In addition to his work for Our Father’s House, MacLean is a case manager and life coach for a New Hampshire-based homeless shelter, and a &quot;criminal investigator” with RCB &amp; Associates, based in Lowell, according to his LinkedIn page. <br/><br/><b>A private meeting </b><br/><br/>Allegations against MacLean were made public at the January Human Rights Commission meeting; the commission followed up during its February meeting. <br/><br/>Neither MacLean nor Nest-Pasierb attended the commission’s meetings. But Nest-Pasierb and Our Father’s House Board President, and former State Sen. Robert Antonioni met privately at least once with commissioners, according to the commission’s <a href=""https://www.scribd.com/document/495756485/2-8-21-Meeting?secret_password=ZMd0m6BQL4NiWyQ0vI3W"" target=""_blank"">Feb. 8 notes</a> obtained by GBH News. <br/><br/>The notes indicate the meeting centered on the allegations against MacLean.<br/><br/>At the public meeting on Feb. 9, the commission voted unanimously to await the results of the police investigation before taking any action. <br/><br/>“He’s innocent until proven guilty, not guilty until proven innocent,” said commission member Cheryl Maguy-Stewart. “But what needs to happen is that people need to come forward so they have people to talk to. It can&#39;t be hearsay.”",Carrie Saldo,Wed Feb 24 05:00:15 EST 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Article,"'I Am Starting To Panic': Family And Medical Leave Recipients In Mass. Face Delayed Payments, Uncertainty ","'I Am Starting To Panic': Family And Medical Leave Recipients In Mass. Face Delayed Payments, Uncertainty ","Filipe Zamborlini and his wife were thrilled about becoming parents, but they weren’t sure exactly how they’d manage child care for their soon-to-arrive daughter. <br/><br/>“My wife and I had some really hard conversations, talking about who would quit their jobs to be able to take care of her,” Zamborlini said. <br/><br/>Both of them work for homeless shelters in the Boston area and have college debt. So, Zamborlini knew quitting his job to be a stay-at-home dad might mean selling the house they’d bought in Salem just three years ago.<br/><br/>But, he said, it turned out that their daughter Clara was born at the perfect time. <br/><br/>Starting on Jan. 1, 2021, most workers in Massachusetts have been able to access paid family and medical leave. This means that Zamborlini was able to avoid leaving his job and continue getting paid as he took care of his newborn. By passing the law, Massachusetts joined a small number of states — and a large number of countries — that offer people time to care for a loved one or deal with their own medical situation while paying <a href=""https://calculator.digital.mass.gov/pfml/yourbenefits/"" target=""_blank"">a portion</a> of their income. <br/><br/>However, the law’s rollout has had ups and downs. One major challenge, GBH News has learned, is that some people have not been receiving their payments from the state, or their checks have arrived many weeks late. <br/><br/>The Department of Family and Medical Leave&#39;s <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/MassPFML"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> page is littered with unhappy Massachusetts residents fretting about overdue bills and fearing losing their homes as they wait for payments from the state. <br/><br/>“Praying this week I receive payment,” wrote Kristin Cameron on the Facebook page, including that she had been waiting several weeks already. “I have 3 kiddos and our mortgage as well as other bills are going to be past due and we need groceries.

Much of their time together is spent listening to music from Brazil and speaking Zamborlini’s native language, Portuguese. <br/><br/>“It&#39;s just amazing to be able to share everything that I know with her,” he said. “It&#39;s just truly phenomenal.”<br/><br/>Zamborlini, who helped petition for the law’s passage, was eager to apply for leave and impressed with the application process. He said the online application was shockingly easy, something you could complete in five minutes. <br/><br/>“This is good government 101, how to properly roll out a really simple user-friendly application,” he said. “The state should be bragging about this left and right.”<br/><br/>The state contracted with a company, called Nava, which specifically focuses on making sure that getting government benefits isn’t too onerous or burdensome. <br/><br/>Most workers in Massachusetts are able to apply for up to 26 weeks of paid leave in a given year for family or medical reasons. For bonding with a new child, parents are able to receive 12 weeks of leave. The state’s program is distinct from the federally mandated benefits under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA). <br/><br/><b>Late payments from the state</b><br/><br/>The Massachusetts law is funded through a tax on employees and many employers that went into effect in October 2019. But that tax was implemented only after a lot of scrambling and a <a href=""https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2019/06/11/state-leaders-agree-three-month-delay-for-paid-leave-taxes/onk0GHhTzpLqnjq3TkQtEP/story.html"" target=""_blank"">three-month delay,</a> which gave businesses more time to prepare. Now, as workers have begun receiving benefits — from a pool they’ve paid into for 15 months — there is more scrambling, as the state struggles to make timely payments. <br/><br/>Zamborlini started his leave on Jan. 4 and waited patiently for the <a href="" https://www.mass.gov/info-details/paid-family-and-medical-leave-pfml-benefits-guide"" target=""_blank"">7-day waiting period</a> to pass before he would be paid. But as the end of the month approached, he had still not received any money. With bills coming due, he started calling the Department of Family and Medical Leave’s call center.<br/><br/>He said he often got the same response, “‘You should be getting a check in the mail next week.’ Nothing. Call back. All right, where is the check? Where&#39;s the money at?’ ‘Coming next week.’ Nothing. Call back again. ‘Coming next week.’ Nothing. Call back again. ‘It&#39;s coming next week.’”<br/><br/>As this routine of being promised imminent payment continued, Zamborlini said, late fees were piling up and he was forced to pull money out of savings. Eventually, he received payment on Feb. 16, more than six weeks after going on leave.<br/><br/>“Six or seven weeks defeats the purpose of it,” said State Rep. Ken Gordon of Bedford, who sponsored the initial legislation. <br/><br/>The late payments came as news to Gordon, who said the whole idea behind the law was to let families — regardless of how much money they have — be with a newborn, a sick relative or recover themselves from an illness without having to worry about money.<br/><br/>“The population that I really had in mind were those that couldn&#39;t afford to take unpaid leave,” he said. <br/><br/>However, Gordon added, he is hopeful that this is simply the state working out the kinks as a new system gets up and running.<br/><br/>The state’s Department of Family and Medical Leave declined numerous requests for an on-the-record interview and did not answer questions about how many people have been affected by the slow payments. <br/><br/>However, in the Feb. 18 virtual town hall, Acosta said the state had received a “very high” number of claimants since the year started, and that was contributing to the delays. She said people can help speed things along by filling out applications completely and providing color copies of the right documents.<br/><br/>“And unfortunately, failure to do any of these will result in a longer processing time,” she said.<br/><br/>In an email, a spokesperson for the Department of Family and Medical Leave said they are adding more employees to the call center to improve customer service and, as of mid-February, the majority of some 3,400 claimants had been paid. The spokesperson did not say how long the claimants had to wait before being paid.<br/><br/>Zamborlini said he worries about families that are living paycheck to paycheck. <br/><br/>“We had to tap into our savings a little bit,&quot; he said. &quot;But what if we had no savings?”",Gabrielle Emanuel,Mon Mar 01 10:11:31 EST 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two years later, Scouts BSA is recognizing its first class of female Eagle Scouts, the highest rank in scouting. Only 8% of scouts ever earn the distinction. <br/><br/>Megan Horling, 17, earned her badge, pin and certificate Tuesday night during a virtual troop Eagle Court of Honor ceremony as part of Belmont’s Spirit of Adventure Council.<br/><br/>Art Kinzinger, scout master of the Council’s Troop 304-G, said Megan was determined and got right to work as soon as she joined. <br/><br/>“She was 15 and just a few months shy of 16. And in scouting, you have to complete all of your work and submit your eagle application before your 18th birthday,” he said.<br/><br/>Horling said the opportunity to be one of the first to attain the Eagle Scout rank is a trailblazing moment.<br/><br/>“It’s a pretty big deal,&quot; he said. &quot;In my opinion it&#39;s not a perfect system yet, and there’s always room for growth.

Article,Cape & Islands Seasonal Businesses Watch And Worry As Worker Visas Remain Uncertain,Cape & Islands Seasonal Businesses Watch And Worry As Worker Visas Remain Uncertain,"With spring less than two weeks away, seasonal businesses on the Cape and Islands are in limbo, wondering if they’ll be able to get enough help for summer.<br/><br/>Cape and Islands businesses rely heavily on two visa programs — J-1, for college students, and H-2B, for other workers, many of whom return year after year. Early this year, Former President Donald Trump extended a freeze on foreign workers entering the U.S. on temporary work visas through March 31. He cited continued weakness in the U.S. labor market due to the coronavirus pandemic.<br/><br/>At Murdick’s Fudge on Martha’s Vineyard, summer visitors watch the crew pour the molten confection onto a slab of marble and work it to just the right consistency. That takes skill, and general manager Mike McCourt doesn’t know whether his most experienced workers will make it here this summer to do the work.<br/><br/>“I have three fudge makers that are in Jamaica, and it&#39;s a process that can take up to a year and a half to train,” he said.<br/><br/>His cafe manager also lives in Jamaica.<br/><br/>Although Trump’s visa ban is about to expire, which solves the problem for J-1 students and some of the H-2Bs, federal law caps the number of H-2B visas each year. And with the cap, Murdick’s Fudge could be out of luck.<br/><br/>“They have this lottery system,” McCourt said, “and if you don&#39;t get in A or B, you&#39;re pretty much on the outside looking in, unless they add to the cap. And we got picked C.”<br/><br/>There’s a chance the cap could be raised — but in the meantime, it’s wait and worry.<br/><br/>“It&#39;s a little unfair that your business is basically put in a gamble situation, and you have to cross your fingers and... a lot of sleepless nights, to say the least,” he said.<br/><br/>Nancy Gardella, Executive Director of the Martha’s Vineyard Chamber of Commerce, said despite the former president&#39;s claims, it’s a misconception that Americans could — or would — take those jobs.<br/><br/>“Ultimately, the truth — the hard, cold truth — is we don&#39;t have the available workforce on Martha&#39;s Vineyard to fill the 2,000-3,000 jobs that become available,” she said. “We simply don’t.”<br/><br/>She said American college students aren&#39;t available in the months they’re needed most. Many go back to school in mid-August, far too early for a tourist season that stretches into October.<br/><br/>Gardella said the most plentiful jobs, in hospitality and landscaping, are unattractive to retirees and sometimes not legally open to high school students.<br/><br/>“No one is clamoring to take those jobs,” she said.<br/><br/>Nor could most people afford to live on the Vineyard for what the summer help earns. Many seasonal employers have to offer housing to make it feasible for workers to come. A combination of federal and state rules, and prevailing wages, means entry-level pay at Murdick’s is about $14 an hour for H-2B workers.<br/><br/>Congressman Bill Keating’s office said Congress has authorized the Secretary of Homeland Security to raise this year’s cap on H-2B visas from 66,000 to 116,000.<br/><br/>Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas was just sworn in February 2nd, and to date, he has not acted.<br/><br/>Keating has advised businesses not to wait in making their plans for the summer.<br/><br/>“As we open up more and more, we want to make sure ... they have the full complement of people necessary to indeed open up,” he said.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, speculation about a post-vaccine travel boom on the Cape and Islands is just warming up, and seasonal businesses are watching and hoping.<br/><br/>&quot;We are anticipating — hoping — for strong seasonal demand in travel, and all the amenities and services that guests use while on Cape Cod,&quot; said Wendy Northcross, CEO of the Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce.",Jennette Barnes,Thu Mar 11 05:00:54 EST 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,Japan Society Of Boston Marks Ten Years Since Deadly Earthquake And Tsunami,Japan Society Of Boston Marks Ten Years Since Deadly Earthquake And Tsunami,"The Japan Society of Boston is among several groups holding events Thursday to mark the 10th anniversary of the strongest earthquake ever to hit Japan on March 11, 2011. The 9.0 magnitude earthquake was followed by a tsunami and a nuclear plant meltdown; at least 16,000 people lost their lives and thousands were displaced as the entire Tohuku region was devastated.<br/><br/>“People really, genuinely were concerned about our families and friends,” said Yuko Handa, Executive Director of the Japan Society of Boston.<br/><br/>Handa said Boston has a strong relationship with Japan through its sister city Kyoto, and after the disaster the Japanese refer to as 3/11, Bostonians stepped in to assist people.<br/><br/>“I really, really remember how people in the local neighborhoods where a lot of the Japanese people lived came to help in fundraising and donations,” Handa said.<br/><br/>The earthquake triggered a massive tsunami that flooded more than 200 miles of coastland and forced the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people. It also triggered a nuclear emergency.<br/><br/>Every year since 2013, Timothy Nagaoka, a Japanese language teacher in the Boston Public Schools, schedules a remembrance of the earthquake anniversary in downtown Boston with origami artwork he calls,<a href=""http://www.cranesonthesquare.com/"" target=""_blank""> &quot;Cranes on the Square&quot; at Copley Square.</a><br/><br/>“We fold paper cranes to pay tribute to the people who lost their lives and are suffering in Northeast Japan,” Nagaoka said.<br/><br/>There is a Japanese tradition Nagaoka said, that when you make 1,000 paper cranes it brings good fortune and sometimes a wish can be granted. In prior years, with the help of passersby, Nagaoka would fold and display 1,000 colorful cranes.<br/><br/>But because of the pandemic, this year&#39;s display that was held last weekend at Copley Square featured 10 large white origami cranes and one giant six-foot-tall crane with a wingspan of 10 feet, that Nagaoka folded himself.<br/><br/>Handa said the Japan Society of Boston will release two special messages on 3/11 from members who lived far away from the disaster but were impacted by it.<br/><br/>“They have a message to say there were things that they learned,&quot; Handa said, in particular &quot;the resilience of the Japanese people and the way they have been rebuilding the cities and towns.”<br/><br/>Harvard and MIT also have  commemorative events scheduled Thursday.<br/>",00000178-1e9d-db99-a17b-3edf3f0b0000,Wed Mar 10 20:44:06 EST 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many families are experiencing burnout, whether it’s with remote schoolwork, house work or work-work. And while kids are set to return to school in April for in-person learning across Massachusetts — perhaps offering some reprieve for beleaguered parents — it doesn&#39;t mean everyone&#39;s fear and anxiety will go away overnight. GBH News checked in with child psychologist Dr. Melinda Macht-Greenberg for advice on how to prepare kids for the next phase of reopening. The questions — asked by our audience members — and answers below have been edited for clarity. <br/><br/><b>1. How can I get my kid ready for the transition back to full-time, in-person learning?</b><br/><br/>It’s going to take a while to change and to get used to school routines. And any change raises anxiety. We all get used to things, everything becomes familiar, that’s part of our resilience package. So making a change again is going to feel unnatural again, and it’s going to take a while to be able to get back into those habits. So I think one thing that can be really valuable is to start now. If we know that schools are going to be reopening in that first or second week of April, people [can] start now with getting back into school routines, whether that’s setting alarms, or having breakfast, picking out school clothes. Whatever works for your family, whatever was your pre-COVID [routine]. <br/><br/>As for schools, expectations are going to have to change. Schools should evaluate what curriculum have they covered and what they haven’t covered. They need to evaluate also where kids are at, not only academically but also socially and emotionally. Because kids are not returning without the emotionality of what this past year has been. We also know when kids have anxiety, it’s harder to learn and take in information. Figure out where that matches up with curriculum. What we don’t want to do is double up and cram more information into these last few months of schools in order to make sure that kids are going to be ready for next year, because I think that will be completely overwhelmng for kids. And right now many, many, many kids are emotionally vulnerable. <br/><br/><b>2. A family member died from COVID. My daughter is 6 and is still asking questions. How can I be honest with her without scaring her?</b><br/><br/>Talk with kids in a developmentally appropriate way and in an honest way — so whatever your family beliefs are, or religious or cultural beliefes with people passing. The important thing is to talk with kids about what your family beliefs are. I think it’s very important to understand that the idea of death for a 6-year-old doesn’t necessarily mean the same thing [as it does for an adult]. And we need to ask our kids, what do you think happens? What are your ideas? How does this feel for you? We may have assumptions as adults that they have a very different view than they might have. And 6-year-olds are very creative and have tremendous imaginations. So if we ask kids, what are you thinking, what are you feeling, then we can help them make sense of the world.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1615476421653,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-dc28-dd0e-abfa-fc3bb6e60000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1615476421653,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-dc28-dd0e-abfa-fc3bb6e60000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;See More&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000171-9dec-d780-a77d-9fee76330003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000178-02b3-dd2a-a3fb-d7f755990003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000177-81eb-d411-a977-f9ef9b8c0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000178-21e3-db79-a379-79ffb5890005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000178-21e3-db79-a379-79ffb50d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/><b>3. Are there any specific strategies for reeling kids back in from screen time limits that have gone out the window, specifically for boys and video games?</b><br/><br/>I think as kids go back to school, that will automatically start to change, because the amount of screen time will diminish, and kids will have more opportunities for socialization as activities resume. Like so many things, it will have to be a gradual change, so I would not recommend saying, &#39;as of tomorrow, we’re going back to pre-COVID screen limits.&#39; I think it’s something to talk about openly with kids and make a plan together, especially for teenagers, because teenagers do so much better when they’re involved as being part of the decision-making and are much more likely to push back if they feel like it’s some rule coming at them rather than a process that they’re engaged in. So talk to them and ask, &#39;how do we manage this now? What makes sense and how can we work on it and build a plan together?&#39;<br/><br/><b>4.</b> <b>My daughter has been remote for a year so she has a fear she won’t have any friends going back. I think it’s because she hasn’t seen them in person for so long. I tell her everyone is in the same boat. Do you have any other reassurance?</b><br/><br/>I think that this is a huge issue, and that anxiety is very typical and something for schools to be mindful of. One thing you might want to try to do is engage with some of the social contacts your child had before. If virtual is the way to do it, or outside if it feels safe, I think it will rekindle the feeling of connection and remind your child of the sense of, this is what it feels like to have a friend and what it feels like to be with somebody. And I think it’s a feeling that kids are really missing and lacking right now. You may want to start with a couple play dates outside of school so when they go into school, it’s much easier to enter into a situation with a buddy.<br/><br/><b>5. How is it best to communicate with employers that child care, especially for children under 5, has gotten harder to obtain? Day cares have longer waislists. My husband and I haven’t had child care for a year and a nanny doesn’t feel safe to us yet.</b><br/><br/>One thing that I hope will come out of this terrible time is that there is much more understanding by employers of the need for more work and family balance. There should be conversations about the gradual change and reintegration of people back into buildings. But I think if there’s an openness of conversation and people are agreeing to work together, that together will actually get them through this. I think what gets harder, when people don’t have that kind of opportunity, that their work is not the kind of place where they can have that kind of conversation, then it’s going to be much more challenging. Unfortunately, we often see the burden falls on the parents. I think there are tremendous opportunities and working from an off-site location is now something that a lot of employers have seen that people can do with success. It allows people flexibility. And flexibility for any business is an opportunity for growth, so I hope that people embrace that. <br/><br/><b>6. My son, who was going to be a freshman in college, had to stay home. I loved having him for another year even if it’s for a crummy reason. Do you see any silver linings? And do you think it helps to look for the positives?</b><br/><br/>One of those things is family time for many people, certainly not everybody, but some of those bonds and connections have really strengthened and grown, and I think that is really positive. We have come to appreciate so many things around us. One of the things that has been helpful, too, is outreach and connection for people who are struggling. I think that will be another silver lining that I hope we can continue. Another thing is, kids have learned about flexibility in a different way. They have learned to go with the flow a bit. They see that they’re going to manage okay. Once this has all passed, that skill that we have to be flexible, that kids are learning to manage and be creative problem solvers, I think that will be beneficial for the future.<br/><br/><i>See more about parenting in a pandemic on NOVA&#39;s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUGun42L72u8wVd0WjuZJ6g"" target=""_blank"">Parentalogic </a>series</i>",Cristina Quinn,Thu Mar 11 10:27:11 EST 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,Some New Parents In Mass. Are Eligible To Take Parental Leave Twice. But They Might Not Know About It,Some New Parents In Mass. Are Eligible To Take Parental Leave Twice. But They Might Not Know About It,"Ann-Elizabeth Young can hear her five-month-old daughter babbling in the next room as she works remotely for a Boston-area shelter. But it won’t be that way for long. At the end of the month, Young will be taking a second maternity leave — and focusing full-time on her daughter. <br/><br/>Young — and other Massachusetts workers who had children in 2020 — have won something of a parental leave lottery. <br/><br/>The state is <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2021/03/01/i-am-starting-to-panic-family-and-medical-leave-recipients-in-mass-face-delayed-payments-uncertainty"" target=""_blank"">rolling out a new law </a>that guarantees most employees in Massachusetts paid family and medical leave. Starting Jan. 1, new parents became eligible for three months of paid leave any time within the first year of their child&#39;s life. Going forward, the state leave — called &quot;bonding leave&quot; — will typically run at the same time as the three-month leave guaranteed to new parents by the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). <br/><br/>But for those like Young who became parents in 2020 and took leave then, the new state law lets them take leave again, as long as they take it before their child turns one. And though the three-month leave guaranteed by FMLA is unpaid, the state will pay new parents a portion of their income. The benefit is funded through a tax on employers and employees. <br/><br/>Young was shocked, and delighted, to learn that she would be able to take a total of six months of leave to be with her daughter.<br/><br/>&quot;This is huge,&quot; Young said. &quot;This is more time than I&#39;d ever dreamed that I would have. And I am so grateful for that.&quot;<br/><br/>But Young said she learned about this second maternity leave by word of mouth, and if an aquaintance hadn&#39;t told her husband about it, she may never have known that she is eligible. And she had to tell her employer, who was also shocked. <br/><br/>The state has not actively advertised the launch of the <a href=""https://www.mass.gov/how-to/how-to-apply-for-paid-family-and-medical-leave-pfml"" target=""_blank"">online application</a> or done significant outreach explaining to new parents that they may be eligible for more leave. In several social media groups, Massachusetts parents have lamented the lack of publicity around the law&#39;s rollout and tried to help one another understand its intricacies. Parents in these groups say in many cases, pediatricians and OBGYNs have also not been aware of the new benefits. The Massachusetts Department of Family and Medical Leave declined an interview request to explain why it hasn&#39;t done more to spread the word. <br/><br/>“I think we could collectively do more to get the word out,” said Rep. Ken Gordon (D - 21st Middlesex), who sponsored the legislation. <br/><br/>From the early stages of drafting the law, he said, legislators were concerned people would not know they had access to paid leave. <br/><br/>“So, written right into the law is an obligation of the employers to post notices that this benefit is available,” he said.  <br/><br/>However, Gordon said the parents eligible for the double maternity leave is not the population he was focused on when pushing to make sure this law became a reality. <br/><br/>“The population that I really had in mind were those that couldn&#39;t afford to take the unpaid leave,” he said. <br/><br/>He wanted to ensure those who had kids in 2020 but hadn’t been able to afford to take the federal unpaid leave could now have leave time to bond with their children. <br/><br/>At a virtual town hall last month, the state’s Department of Family and Medical Leave confirmed the one-off double maternity leave opportunity. Department representatives pointed out that in the future, under the new law, birth mothers are eligible for two separate leaves anyways.<br/><br/>“If you&#39;re the birth parent, you can apply for both medical and bonding leave. In those situations, we ask that you apply for a medical leave first,&quot; Greg Norfleet, the deputy director of operations at the Department of Family and Medical Leave, said at the virtual town hall.<br/><br/>If a doctor certifies that a pregnant woman has a “serious medical condition,” she can take up to 14 weeks of medical leave while pregnant or after delivery. In addition, any time in the first year of their child’s life, she can take 12 weeks of bonding leave. If a woman takes both medical and bonding leave, she could have up to 26 weeks — or half a year — of paid leave. <br/><br/>If the law had been in effect in 2020, Young likely would have qualified to take paid medical leave to recover from her emergency c-section before taking paid bonding leave. <br/><br/>Christopher Geehern, the executive vice president of Associated Industries of Massachusetts, a group representing more than 3,000 employers, said this can be hard for companies.<br/><br/>“I think the biggest challenge for employers with paid family and medical leave really hasn&#39;t been the cost. It&#39;s been the logistics of replacing people who are on leave,” Geehern said.<br/><br/>So far, he said, they haven’t seen too many cases of people taking leave twice, but reconfiguring a plant or office or restaurant to accommodate it is not easy.<br/><br/>“I don&#39;t think it&#39;s been a showstopper for any company, but [paid leave] certainly has added to their kind of administrative burdens,” he said.<br/><br/>Young said that not knowing about the benefit earlier means it&#39;s been a scramble to get everything at work organized before her leave starts at the end of the month. But, she said, her employer has been accommodating and supportive, which she knows might not be the case for everyone.<br/><br/>“I can see some employers not responding to that particularly well,&quot; Young said, adding that putting the burden on employees to educate their employers about the law &quot;puts a lot of undue stress on families.”",Gabrielle Emanuel,Mon Mar 15 16:09:27 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Article,It's Her Time: Female Entrepreneurship In Massachusetts is Skyrocketing,It's Her Time: Female Entrepreneurship In Massachusetts is Skyrocketing,"The climate for women-driven entrepreneurship is improving in Massachusetts, but women could benefit from a statewide &quot;entrepreneurial hub&quot; that would allow more women to collaborate and share resources.<br/><br/>That recommendation is one of several included in a report released Monday. The Women’s Entrepreneur Initiative (WEI) Study concludes that for them to continue to make gains, women business owners need better access to resources, financing, expertise and networking.<br/><br/>“What we found from a comprehensive literature review was that women are the fastest growing, highest performing and most economically underutilized subsegment of entrepreneurs,” said Constance Gamache of Deloitte Consulting, one of the lead analysts of the study.<br/><br/>Women represent 45 percent of all American business owners, according to data collected for the report, and that number continues to grow.<br/><br/>“Women-owned businesses in the latter half of the past decade grew at more than two-fold the rate of all other businesses, and if you slice this data even further,” Gamache said, “women of color-owned businesses have grown fourfold.”<br/><br/>The advancements come despite significant funding challenges. Women who founded businesses or own businesses received less than half the investment capital as businesses founded by men, the report reads. In terms of return on investment, the women generated 78 cents per investment dollar, while men generated only 31 cents.<br/><br/>“This growth and performance,&quot; Gamache said, ”has resulted in $1.9 trillion in national revenue over the years 2014 and 2019.”<br/><br/>Cory Thomas, the chairman and CEO of Rapid Seven and the NAACP Social Justice Committee, said he welcomes the research because it helps show where there are constraints and biases that effect women in business.<br/><br/>“Gender, race and economic disparities are all interrelated,&quot; Thomas said. &quot;And reports like this with a focus on action will help us transform the entrepreneur, our economy and our society.”<br/><br/>The report is titled, <a href=""https://633a9a3b-a223-4c7d-b77d-ce154f6a2f3c.filesusr.com/ugd/5c57db_967eae924efd40d8b269aa8d1248fd3f.pdf"" target=""_blank"">It’s Her Time: Women Entrepreneurship in Massachusetts.”</a> It&#39;s a collaboration of the Boston Mayor&#39;s Office of Women&#39;s Advancement and the Massachusetts Competitive Partnership, and Deloitte Consulting LLP.<br/><br/>At a virtual event where the report was released Monday, several successful entrepreneurs spoke about their experiences as women business owners.<br/><br/>Dr. Sangeeta Bhatia, the Dorothy Wilson professor of bioengineering at MIT said mentoring and finance are two key focus areas.<br/><br/>“Access to mentors can show you kind of a roadmap for how to start a company, but not just who to call,&quot; Bhatia said, &quot;[but] how to have access to the venture capitalist and who to put on your board.” <br/><br/>Dr. Daphne Koller, a professor of computer science and a MacArthur Fellow at Stanford University, said there are still a lot of impediments to the path forward for young girls in the areas of STEM and entrepreneurship, including the lack of a network.<br/><br/>“It’s really important when building a company,” Koller said, “to have the people that you know who could connect you to the right kind of other people, and especially in the world that we live in today where talent is such a scarce commodity.”<br/><br/>Researchers did an extensive review of existing literature around women entrepreneurs, surveyed 102 women entrepreneurs in Massachusetts, and held 13 in-depth interviews with women entrepreneurs.",00000178-5b08-d0b9-abfc-fb083bd90000,Mon Mar 22 15:59:20 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,Unprecedented Unemployment Fraud Leads To Tax Worries For Victims,Unprecedented Unemployment Fraud Leads To Tax Worries For Victims,"This tax season is bringing more bad news for some victims of unemployment fraud. State officials are notifying some residents that they could face tax bills for unemployment benefits they never received.<br/><br/>Last spring, Eileen and Chris Barnacoat of West Townsend discovered that someone had stolen Chris’ identity and was fraudulently collecting unemployment payments. It took months to sort out. But last month, the state notified the couple to say Chris could be taxed by the IRS on the stolen benefits.<br/><br/>“My first thought was, ‘Oh, no, we&#39;re going to be in trouble with the IRS because we didn&#39;t do this’,” Chris Barnacoat said.<br/><br/>The Massachusetts Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development wrote to the couple to say they owed taxes on more than $8,000. The couple previously had notified the state they were victims of fraud. But with the new notice, they were thrown back into the frustrating and confusing process of defending themselves.<br/><br/>“You know, not only would you have to be proving to Massachusetts that you didn&#39;t receive the money, but then you&#39;d have to be proving to the Internal Revenue Service that you didn&#39;t receive the money,” Eileen Barnacoat said.<br/> <br/>State officials estimate that Massachusetts paid out nearly $690 million in unemployment payments that were either confirmed fraudulent or potentially fraudulent between last April and January 2021. During that same time period, more than <a href=""https://www.mass.gov/news/update-nationwide-unemployment-scam-targets-massachusetts-claimants-0"" target=""_blank"">150,000 Massachusetts residents</a> reported to the state that their personal information was stolen as part of unemployment frauds. It’s not known exactly how many victims, like the Barnacoats, could unexpectedly face taxes because of that fraud. But tax experts are advising clients to get ahead of any tax problems. <br/> <br/>Christopher Pulick, CPA and tax partner at Kevin P. Martin Associates of Braintree, said he knows of at least a dozen fraud victims who potentially face taxes because of it.<br/> <br/>&quot;We&#39;ve been telling some of our clients to file with the IRS to let them know about fraud,” he said.<br/> <br/>The state has a form that victims can request and fill out called a<a href=""https://www.mass.gov/forms/unemployment-fraud-reporting-form"" target=""_blank""> corrected 1099G form</a> thatis sent to the IRS and the state, Pulick said, so victims won’t be required to pay taxes on the stolen benefits. <br/> <br/>The Barnacoats took that step, and they say their tax issue is resolved. But they are still upset they had to deal with the fraud at all.<br/><br/>“[Massachusetts] and all the other states don&#39;t seem to have a really adequate system for being able to identify people that make claims,” Chris Barnacoat said.<br/> <br/>In response to an inquiry about the high volume of illegitimate claims, the Massachusetts Department of Labor and workforce Development issued a statement to GBH News that states the department has “added protections to the process, including enhanced identity verification and authentication measures.” <br/>State officials estimate they have recovered just about one-third of the nearly $690 million paid out to fraud scams.<br/>",00000178-6077-d89e-a7ff-ef7f7de80000,Wed Mar 24 12:49:24 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,Duxbury Fires Football Coach After Anti-Semitic Play Calls,Duxbury Fires Football Coach After Anti-Semitic Play Calls,"A Massachusetts high school fired its successful football coach and hired an outside consultant Wednesday to assist an investigation into reports that the team used anti-Semitic language, including a mention of Auschwitz, in its on-field play calling during a recent game.<br/><br/>“The outrage is real, warranted, and we hear it,&quot; Duxbury High School&#39;s administration said in an emailed statement. “The fact that members of our school community used such offensive language, including anti-Semitic language, is horrifying and disappointing.&quot;<br/><br/>In response, the school has “severed ties&quot; with head coach Dave Maimaron and canceled this Friday&#39;s game against Hingham, said the statement, signed by four members of the administration, including district Superintendent John Antonucci.<br/><br/>The district has also hired Edward Mitnick of Just Training Solutions LLC to assist in the investigation. Mitnick is an attorney and investigator with 30 years&#39; experience in such matters.<br/><br/>“We know from many conversations, emails, and online posts that many people want action now, and we appreciate that sentiment. However, we are still in the middle of an active investigation and it is important that we get accurate information and facts in this case,&quot; the statement said.<br/><br/>The announcement came the day after Robert Trestan, president of the New England Anti-Defamation League, called for an independent investigation. Trestan said he was told by Antonucci that the words “rabbi&quot; and &quot;dreidel&quot; were also used in Duxbury&#39;s March 12 game against Plymouth North. Plymouth school officials alerted Duxbury about the matter.<br/><br/>“It’s deeply hurtful to the Jewish community to learn that the plays somehow connect to the Holocaust and Judaism,” Trestan said. “This is a really serious situation. There are indications of a systemic failure both on and off the field.”<br/><br/>The insensitive words were not directed at the opposing team or at a particular player, Antonucci said.<br/><br/>Maimaron, a special needs teacher at the school, had released a statement this week in which he apologized.<br/><br/>“On behalf of the staff and players of the Duxbury High School football team, I want to extend my apology for the insensitive, crass and inappropriate language used in the game on March 12th,” he said. He called the language “careless, unnecessary and most importantly hurtful on its face — inexcusable.”<br/><br/>Massachusetts high school football is being played in the spring this year because the coronavirus pandemic caused postponement of the fall season.<br/><br/>Duxbury in recent years has been one of the state&#39;s most successful teams, with five state championships since 2005. The affluent coastal community about 30 miles south of Boston has nearly 16,000 residents, according to the Census Bureau.<br/>",Associated Press,Wed Mar 24 15:58:09 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Article,Duxbury Residents Tell Select Board That Anti-Semitism Must Be Addressed ,Duxbury Residents Tell Select Board That Anti-Semitism Must Be Addressed ,"A number of Duxbury residents told their Board of Selectmen at a meeting Monday night that anti-Semitism has been an ongoing problem in their community. The comments came as an independent investigation continues into the use of anti-Semitic language on the field by the high school football team.<br/><br/>Long-time Duxbury High School coach Dave Maimaron, who apologized last week for what he called “insensitive, crass and inappropriate language” by his team, was fired on March 24.<br/><br/>“I think it&#39;s well known that this was not an isolated incident,” said Karen Wong, who described herself as a Jewish woman married to an Asian-American. Wong is a member of Duxbury For All, a local group focused on diversity, equity and inclusion.<br/><br/>“It&#39;s my understanding this has been going on for years, maybe almost 10 years,” Wong said. “And in the last week, a week plus, I have fielded an unbelievable number of phone calls, emails, text messages from people in the Jewish community who are hurting.”<br/><br/>Duxbury For All previously sent a letter to the Board of Selectmen saying that the football team used terms including &quot;Auschwitz,&quot; &quot;gas chamber,&quot; &quot;Hitler&quot; and &quot;Holocaust&quot; to call plays at a game on March 12.<br/><br/>On Monday, football players and their families were informed that three games scheduled for later this week have been postponed to allow the team to attend the first of two mandatory diversity, equity and inclusion workshops.<br/><br/>That letter to players, from Duxbury High School Principal Jim Donovan and Athletic Director Thom Holdgate, said the program “will focus on the Holocaust, not just as a historical event but as a lived experience that continues to impact families every day.”<br/><br/>During Monday&#39;s Select Board meeting, school committee chair Kellie Bresnehan said she and her fellow committee members “have had the entire range of emotions, as you can imagine — from horror, shock, disappointment, disgust, sadness.”<br/><br/>“We obviously are committed to going forward and working with the community,” Bresnehan told the select board. “And we recognize that a lot of education can come through the schools, but it is a community effort.&quot; She added that they can&#39;t control what happens at home: &quot;We don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on there and what&#39;s talked about and what&#39;s discussed.”<br/><br/>Wong encouraged community members to attend an online event Thursday sponsored by Congregation Shirat and supported by Duxbury for All and Duxbury No Place for Hate. It’s listed as being for “Jewish neighbors and all those who are hurting from the recent revelations about the anti-Semitic and racist terms used by the Duxbury High School football team, to come together in a safe space to share their deep grief.”<br/><br/><i>This story has been updated to clarify that Congregation Shirat is sponsoring the online event Thursday.</i>",Mark Herz,Mon Mar 29 22:18:47 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Article,"Fishermen, Feeling Blamed for Right Whale Entanglements, Say #ShowUsTheRope","Fishermen, Feeling Blamed for Right Whale Entanglements, Say #ShowUsTheRope","Conservationists say that every North Atlantic right whale counts, as the population has fallen to around 360. But one entangled right whale found in Cape Cod Bay—named Snow Cone—has triggered an outcry of frustration from fishermen, who say they’re being unfairly blamed for the decline of the critically endangered species.<br/><br/>The uproar started with a Facebook <a class=""Link"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/coastalstudies"" target=""_blank"" style=""background-repeat: no-repeat; box-sizing: border-box; background-color: transparent; touch-action: manipulation; color: var(--linkColor); text-decoration: none;"">post</a>.<br/><br/>On Wednesday, March 10, a team from Provincetown’s Center for Coastal Studies freed Snow Cone from 300 feet of rope. Though some rope remained, possibly embedded in her jaw, the team felt they gave her a fighting chance to shed the rest on her own.<br/><br/>“We’re going to keep an eye on her, and help her out if she needs more,” said Scott Landry, who oversees disentanglement efforts. “We think we did our best by her.”<br/><br/>Shortly after, the center described the team’s success on its Facebook page, and used a photo from an aerial survey that shows the whale and the telltale rope from 1,000 feet in the air.<br/><br/>“So, I remember seeing this,” said Nick Muto, who’s been catching lobsters out of Chatham for the last 20 years. “They posted something, you know: &#39;Right whale number 3560; Snow Cone; 16-year-old breeding female; partially disentangled.&#39;”<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1617183762973,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000163-adcb-d8e6-a177-bffbef630000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1617183762973,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000163-adcb-d8e6-a177-bffbef630000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;Get More Of The Story&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000167-fc69-d25a-a37f-fff912c40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000016c-6426-d0de-ab6c-65efad750003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000178-02bc-db7a-a7fb-b6fc6d280003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000178-87a8-dbb7-a7ff-8feae07b002a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000178-87a8-dbb7-a7ff-8feadffc0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/><br/>Right away, Muto noticed that the Facebook post said the retrieved rope likely came from a fishery, but there was no close-up picture.<br/><br/>“So my hashtag, #ShowUsTheRope, is me trying to lay it right on the Center for Coastal Studies,” he said. “I’m saying, ‘Hey, involve us in the process. Show us the rope. Let us weigh in on what&#39;s going on.’”<br/><br/>Nearly 85 percent of right whales bear scars of entanglement. But some fishermen say they’re being cast as villains, as little is publicly known about the specific rope being pulled off of whales. Fishermen say the color, diameter, and specific markings on rope or buoys can act almost like fingerprints to identify the source either geographically, or in some cases, down to an individual fisherman.<br/><br/>“There&#39;s fishing gear up and down the coast. Some of it can be towline; some of it can be discarded line; some of it can be from the recreational sector,” Muto said. “It&#39;s just automatically labeled as fishing gear and we&#39;re the ones that pay the price.”<br/><br/>The center did make clear: the rope in this case probably didn’t come from Cape Cod Bay, because Snow Cone’s injuries look months old, and right whales haven’t been in local waters that long.<br/><br/>Also, the rescue group isn’t collecting evidence. That job belongs to federal analysts and law enforcement groups, who have to be able to study the gear first before releasing photos.<br/><br/>“Law enforcement will open up an investigation into it. Until the investigation is closed, we don&#39;t release a lot of information,” said Colleen Coogan, a wildlife protection official for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).<br/><br/>National Oceanic And Atmospheric AdministrationNOAA provided this photo offering a look inside the warehouse in Rhode Island, where gear pulled off of whales is stored and analyzed.Law enforcement teams and gear analysts, including several fishermen, examine retrieved gear in a warehouse in Rhode Island, where members of the public can request a tour, she said. Those tours have been canceled in the last year because of COVID-19 restrictions.<br/><br/>But fishermen say the whole process is flawed: pictures of the gear aren’t posted online. Rather, the federal fisheries service produces a report that includes descriptions of gear, without any photos.

He was only half joking. “I want to see proof,” he said.<br/><br/>The near impossibility of seeing this proof is especially frustrating, he said, because the stakes are growing more dire. To protect the whales, Massachusetts regulators have required the state’s 800 lobstermen to use special rope that breaks more easily under pressure from whales, and they’ve closed the lobster fishery in nearly all state waters from February to May.<br/><br/>Fishermen, who describe a deeply mistrustful relationship with conservation groups and federal officials, want to know how the regulations are justified by the evidence.<br/><br/>“That is the million-dollar question,” Coogan said. “So we&#39;re authorizing a fishery that we cannot state with confidence is not contributing to the serious injuries and mortalities, and we&#39;re not allowed to do that. That’s what the laws say.”<br/><br/>Ninety-three percent of ropes that run from surface to seafloor in Northeast waters—the ones that are most likely to entangle whales—come from the lobster and Jonah crab fisheries, Coogan added. And if officials wait to know for sure that these fishermen’s gear is to blame for the majority of entanglements, the already dwindling population will just continue to decline.<br/><br/>“We don&#39;t have the time to wait till we have all the data,” Coogan said.<br/><br/>For their part, many fishermen say they understand that the whales need to be protected, but they don’t feel like they should be expected to take everything on faith. They said they’re being regulated nearly out of existence, and can’t even see photos that might prove they’re to blame.<br/><br/>It only leaves Richardson with less trust, and more questions.<br/><br/>“Why,” Richardson asked, “why, why wouldn’t you want to try and prove your point? You say it&#39;s a fishing rope, but you&#39;re not going to show us any pictures of what you found?”<br/><br/>To put it simply, the fishermen say: “Show us the rope.”",Eve Zuckoff,Tue Mar 30 17:56:00 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,The Loss Of Little Becker College Could Have Big Impact On Leicester,The Loss Of Little Becker College Could Have Big Impact On Leicester,"When Becker College closes its doors in just a few months, the town of Leicester is going to lose its biggest employer and its most famous landmark. The College is located in the center of the city: The town common is the campus, and the campus is the town common.<br/><br/>For nearby businesses, the loss poses an immediate concern.<br/><br/>With its announcement last week, Becker joins a list of 20 other Massachusetts schools that shut down within the past five years, eight of which were mergers or acquisitions, according to the Department of Higher Education.<br/><br/>“Unfortunately, Becker’s impending closure is devastating to the community,” Leicester Town Administrator David Generoux said. “We have a number of small businesses that do cater to the Becker faculty and students.”<br/><br/>Becker College, which dates back to 1784, is home to about 1,700 students and 300 employees. Its Leicester campus of red and white brick buildings stretches 44 acres and includes six dormitories, where most students stay even with the additional Worcester campus a few miles down the road. The football field adjacent to the campus was renovated in 2008, and new turf was installed just two years ago.<br/><br/>Generoux said that there are businesses in the area that have made a good living thanks to the student population.<br/><br/>“Having that population leave the town is definitely devastating to them,” Generoux said. “We’re concerned that it’s going to be problematic for them to continue on without having that group to sell items to. We definitely have concerns.”<br/><br/>Before the pandemic, when classes were in session, stores just a few hundred feet from campus like Carmen’s Shears and Clippers, saw a lot of student traffic, especially from the college’s sports teams.<br/><br/>“They don’t know the area that well and they don’t have cars,” said Carmen Clark, the salon’s owner. “So they come here to get their haircuts and whatever they need done for grooming.”<br/><br/>“It does affect the majority of the people around here, like Cumberland Farms, the diner, the restaurants down the street, because it’s just around this area,” Clark said. “I just did a haircut with a gentleman who was from Louisiana … He didn’t want to go down to Worcester because he doesn’t know the area.”<br/><br/>The pandemic has made trouble for a lot of the businesses in town, and now the loss of Becker adds to the damage. <br/><br/>“I think the whole corona ended the Becker kids coming here, most of them anyway,” said Melissa Liljegren, a waitress at Farmhouse Diner, which is next to Clark’s salon. “I do have a small little following of the Becker football team and a couple people. I am going to miss my Becker girls that come in here for our stuffed cheesecake French toast.”<br/><br/>Liljegren now predicts that the diner’s coming year will be no better than business during the pandemic.<br/><br/>“A lot of people haven’t been coming out like usual,” she said.<br/><br/>Generoux added that Becker leaving might affect overall property value within the town.<br/><br/>“I think in the short term, everything will be affected in town,” Generoux said. “The businesses will feel it. There will be vacant housing in town.”<br/><br/>Generoux is hoping the campus can economically serve the needs of the community in another way, however it is transformed.<br/><br/>“Becker has maintained a very beautiful and historic campus,” Generoux said. “We are hopeful that in the end that property will be redeveloped into something else that will also be able to serve the needs of the business in the community...Hopefully in the coming months, we’ll have more information and we’ll have an idea of what is going to be done going forward.”<br/><br/>Clark University and Worcester Polytech Institute have said they will take in Becker students, and Clark University says it plans to use some of Becker’s facilities to continue the school’s highly-regarded digital game design program. But that would be housed on the Worcester campus, not in Leicester.<br/><br/><i>Monica Sager is an intern in the GBH News Worcester Bureau</i>",Monica Sager,Mon Apr 05 21:40:06 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His new book, </i>The Climate Diet: 50 Simple Ways to Trim Your Carbon Footprint, <i>gives readers simple ways to make their everyday lives more environmentally friendly. GBH Radio’s Henry Santoro talked to Greenberg about his book and lifelong dedication to sustainability. The transcript below has been edited for clarity. </i><br/><br/><b>Henry Santoro:</b> Paul Greenberg is a best selling author. He&#39;s a journalist, a renowned expert in seafood, health, technology and climate change, and his books on sustainability and seafood have received widespread acclaim. His TED talk about the fish that we overeat has over 1.6 million views to date. And he once spent a year eating seafood for breakfast, lunch and dinner, which was documented in the Frontline documentary, <i>The Fish on My Plate</i>. His new book is called <i>The Climate Diet: 50 Simple Ways to Trim Your Carbon Footprint</i>. And it&#39;s a pleasure to welcome Paul Greenberg to GBH and Henry in The Hub. Good morning, Paul.<br/><br/><b>Paul Greenberg:</b> Hey, Henry, how are you?<br/><br/><b>Santoro:</b> You are a Connecticut kid. You grew up near the water. You did a lot of fishing.

But I literally saw the transformation of my hometown before my eyes, and I saw the way that wastefulness in general devoured nature. The biggest thing that I learned from that growing up is that nature is finite. We, by our greed and expansiveness, make sometimes irreparable incursions into nature.<br/><br/> <b>Santoro: </b>This book is about being environmentally sound. It&#39;s about reducing your carbon footprint. It sounds to me, Paul, like this encompasses everything that you already do.<br/> <br/><b>Greenberg: </b>Yes and no. I’ve looked at climate for a long time, but I don&#39;t pretend to be an expert in all the different areas that I cover. You know, what I did with this book was to speak to 50 or 60 people that I thought were really the experts in their field. So I did learn a lot about changing my lifestyle.<br/><br/> <b>Santoro:</b> Your past books focus on eating locally sourced food—it’s something that seems easier to do these days. Does the climate diet address any of these subjects?<br/><br/><b>Greenberg: </b>Eating locally isn&#39;t always the best choice. If it&#39;s the middle of winter and you&#39;re going to a farmer&#39;s market that might be selling hot house grown green? Hmm, not so great. Frankly, the biggest problem Americans have when it comes to climate is driving. If you&#39;ve just driven 20 miles to buy a single head of broccoli from your local farmer&#39;s market, you&#39;ve really nuked all your good smugness by burning all that gasoline in the process. Look, I&#39;m all for farmer&#39;s markets. I&#39;m all for local produce. But let&#39;s do it wisely within the context of the carbon budget that we need to set for ourselves.<br/><br/><b>Santoro:</b> What does <i>The Climate Diet</i> say about seafood?<br/><br/><b>Greenberg:</b> Certain seafoods are actually pretty low-carbon, the main reason being that seafood, a lot of times, is wild. How much carbon that comes from a wild fish is largely dependent on how the fish is caught. As you mentioned, I&#39;ve been all over the map in terms of my diet. I ate only fish for a year, then I was vegan for a year. Now I&#39;m back to what I call a “pesca-terranean” diet, which is mostly vegan, but the animal protein that I do eat is coming from just a select few fish and shellfish. The most consumed seafood in America remains shrimp and shrimp remains to be just about the highest-carbon choice you can make from the sea. So if we could trade our shrimp cocktails for some oysters on the half-shell, we&#39;d be doing a pretty good carbon trade.<br/><br/><b>Santoro:</b> One important part of the fight against climate change is climate justice. How does your book address that issue and why is climate justice so important?<br/><br/><b>Greenberg:</b> You know, this is an all-hands-on-deck moment. If we&#39;re unfairly penalizing people of color and people that are economically disadvantaged, we&#39;re basically keeping them out of the climate fight. In the last section of the book, which is called “Fighting and Winning,” one of my rules is that you have to fight racial injustice at the same time that you&#39;re fighting climate injustice.<br/><br/><b>Santoro: </b>Paul Greenberg is the author of <i>The Climate Diet: 50 Simple Ways to Trim Your Carbon Footprint</i>. The book is available everywhere.<br/><br/><i>GBH News Intern Lucy Barnum assisted with production of this interview.</i>",00000178-d6f9-dbb7-a7ff-defbcf540000,Fri Apr 16 16:52:37 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Article,MCAS Graduation Requirement Waived For Class Of 2022,MCAS Graduation Requirement Waived For Class Of 2022,"This year&#39;s high school junior class will not need to take or pass the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) tests in order to graduate, the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education decided on Tuesday.<br/><br/>The move is one of a series of pandemic-influenced shifts the state has made within its standardized testing program since COVID-19 first shuttered school buildings last spring.<br/><br/>Students are typically required to pass 10th grade English and math MCAS exams in order demonstrate competency in the two subjects and graduate. Last year&#39;s 10th graders, the class of 2022, did not have an opportunity to take those tests last spring because education officials obtained a federal waiver and legislative approval to cancel the spring 2020 MCAS administration in the early days of remote learning.<br/><br/>Juniors will still be able to take the test in the spring and next fall to pursue scholarship opportunities, but the board voted to modify graduation requirements for the class of 2022 to allow those students to demonstrate competency in math and English by completing a relevant course instead of earning a passing MCAS score.<br/><br/>The change, which board member Matt Hills described as a &quot;very narrow, tailored approach&quot; affecting one class and one component of the exams, cleared the board unanimously.<br/><br/>&quot;I think we&#39;re as far as we need to go, and I hope this is the end of the modifications to MCAS,&quot; Hills said.<br/><br/>Darlene Lombos, the board&#39;s labor representative, and Jasper Coughlin, its student representative, both said they&#39;d like to have additional conversations about MCAS testing.<br/><br/>&quot;During this year when it&#39;s really easy for students to feel cold and to feel that there aren&#39;t people at higher levels looking out for them, I think this is exactly the type of thing that shows students that we&#39;re caring about them,&quot; said Coughlin, a Billerica Memorial High School student.<br/><br/>The pandemic&#39;s disruptions to schooling have renewed debates about the role of standardized testing, with teachers unions and some lawmakers calling for the MCAS to be canceled this year, and the Baker administration describing the exams as a key tool for gauging where students may have fallen behind while learning remotely.<br/><br/>Ed Lambert, executive director of the Massachusetts Business Alliance for Education, wrote to the board on Tuesday voicing a position that members of the class of 2022 should still be required to take the MCAS even if they are not required to earn a certain score to demonstrate competency.<br/><br/>Lambert said that past years&#39; passing rates suggest 85 percent or more students would achieve what would normally be considered a passing grade, and crossing that threshold would allow them &quot;to know their diploma is of equal weight to those of previous classes of graduates.&quot;<br/><br/>For other students, Lambert said, their scores would provide information that could be used &quot;to create an Educational Proficiency Plan for their final year of school designed to assist them in meeting the essential standards prior to graduation.&quot;<br/><br/>Board member Martin West suggested that schools encourage students to take the test, both for a chance to qualify for scholarships and to &quot;learn about where they stand, relative to the expectations that we as a board have laid out for them.&quot;<br/><br/>The board also voted to solicit public comment on Commissioner Jeff Riley&#39;s proposed amendments to admissions regulations for vocational-technical schools. A final vote is expected in June after the comment period.<br/><br/>Among other changes, Riley&#39;s proposal would give the schools flexibility to set their own admissions policies &quot;that promote equitable access,&quot; and would remove the requirement that grades, attendance, discipline record and counselor recommendation be used as admissions criteria.<br/><br/>Riley&#39;s plan also would require each vocational school and program to annually submit its admissions policy to the state by Aug. 15 and would bar the use of selective criteria that disproportionately exclude members of protected classes, unless the criteria is &quot;validated as essential to participation&quot; and alternatives are unavailable.<br/><br/>Two Chelsea High School students, Aya Faiz and Emily Menjivar, told the board that criteria like grades, attendance, disciplinary records and recommendations can create barriers for students of color, who can face bias at school.<br/><br/>Faiz said she is &quot;extremely cautious&quot; about her behavior at school after getting suspended for two days in middle school for using a curse word. She said she saw her white peers instead get punished with detentions for cursing, and that Black and brown students are often viewed as &quot;more adultified&quot; in schools and therefore receive harsher discipline.<br/><br/>&quot;We are handed higher expectations despite usually being from schools that have less resources and we are punished more severely for not meeting them,&quot; she said.<br/><br/>Menjivar and Faiz are members of the Vocational Education Justice Coalition, which supports moving to lottery-based admissions.<br/><br/>Riley&#39;s amendments seek to make clear that the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education can order changes to a school&#39;s admission policy in cases of non-compliance, and those changes &quot;may include requiring a lottery,&quot; according to a memo <a href=""https://www.statehousenews.com/content/docs/2021/04-15_VocTechAdmissionsMemo.pdf"" style=""color: rgb(0, 106, 199); text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-skip-ink: none;"">outlining the proposal</a>.<br/><br/>Another coalition member, Dan French of Citizens for Public Schools, urged the board to have updated rules for vocational school admissions in place by July so that school policies would be submitted for review this August, before the school year begins.<br/><br/>&quot;We don&#39;t need another year of a discriminatory and exclusionary state policy in place,&quot; he said.<br/><br/>French said the new proposal does not go far enough because it gives each school &quot;too much latitude&quot; to interpret what criteria is allowable.<br/><br/>Board member Michael Moriarty called Riley&#39;s recommendations a &quot;stronger approach than simply imposing lotteries across all schools.&quot; He said lotteries amount to &quot;a solution that addresses access&quot; but have &quot;absolutely no eye on outcome.&quot;",Katie Lannan,Tue Apr 20 17:30:48 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,Asian Republicans Charge Massachusetts GOP With Discrimination,Asian Republicans Charge Massachusetts GOP With Discrimination,"A battle over control of the state Republican party has led to claims that its leader has discriminated against Asian American voters trying to fill a vacant political position. <br/><br/>In a letter to national party officials, more than two dozen Vietnamese-American Republicans alleged that Massachusetts Republican Party Chairman Jim Lyons led a &quot;callous and underhanded scheme to discriminate&quot; against Asian-American voters trying to reorganize ward committees in order to fill two open seats representing Dorchester and South Boston on the Republican State Committee, the 82-member panel that governs the party&#39;s activities.<br/><br/>&quot;Chairman Lyons is demanding that, in order to reorganize, all of our members must &#39;prove&#39; their identities through carefully coordinated, back-to-back Zoom meetings under the MassGOP&#39;s watchful eye,&quot; the letter said, going on to say that many in the Vietnamese GOP community are elderly, do not have access to a computer or face language barriers.<br/><br/>Lyons told GBH News that new ward committees organized in anticipation of a special caucus to fill the two state committee seats, including wards in Dorchester&#39;s Veitnamese neighborhoods, were formed incorrectly. He rejects claims that he has discriminated against Asian Americans.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1619200033325,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000163-adcb-d8e6-a177-bffbef630000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1619200033325,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000163-adcb-d8e6-a177-bffbef630000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;Get More Of The Story&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000175-4c36-d94e-a9f7-ccb729050003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000174-b2bc-d401-ab76-fabdc0c40003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-377f-d887-adfb-77ff69d80000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000178-ffd1-d2db-af7a-ffd9e6870017&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000178-ffd1-d2db-af7a-ffd9e5fe0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/><br/>&quot;My focus is just the opposite: to increase the number of Asian Americans in our party,&quot; Lyons told GBH News. &quot;And that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re trying to do,&quot; <br/><br/>The winners of the two open seats could help tip the balance in a fight over control of the Republican Party in Massachusetts as it anticipates a contentious 2022 nominating convention.<br/><br/>Multiple state GOP committee members said that conservatives aligned with Lyons could use their majority on the state committee to increase the threshold of support a candidate needs to access the party&#39;s primary ballot for governor. During Gov. Charlie Baker&#39;s last run in 2018, the percentage of convention support needed for ballot access was 15%, but a rules change by conservatives could increase that threshold in 2022.<br/><br/>That could potentially force Baker, a moderate, out of the running for his own party&#39;s nomination.<br/><br/>In a March 29 letter to members of the newly established ward committee, Lyons wrote that &quot;a formal review of the formation of wards 6, 7, 13, 15, 16 and 17 were found to have been formed incorrectly for a variety of reasons, invaliding them, including and not limited to failure to notify the regional chair, individuals living in the wrong district, unenrolled individuals, individuals registered as Democrats and individuals submitting inconsistent signatures.&quot;<br/><br/>Peabody Republican state committee woman Jaclyn Corriveau, a second generation Chinese and Vietnamese American, questioned the ethics behind Lyons&#39; decision to reject the newly organized Boston wards and said that similar bylaws were waived in her race.<br/><br/>&quot;These are predominantly Asian American and predominantly Vietnamese American neighborhoods and wards.&quot; Corriveau told GBH News. &quot;It raises some questions. And as an Asian American, it definitely raises some questions with me.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We are not changing any rules for the caucus,&quot; Lyons said in response to Corriveau. &quot;The same rules in place for Peabody will be in place when we hold the caucus for the first Suffolk district.&quot;<br/><br/>There are only two candidates formally running for the two open state committee spots. Jeanna Tamas and Timothy Smyth, both of South Boston, are running as a ticket and support Baker.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#39;s one of the reasons why we believe [Lyons is] trying to dissolve the wards right now — so that he has more time before he announces our special caucus for our election,&quot; Tamas said. &quot;Because I think he&#39;s definitely looking for two other candidates to run against us.&quot;<br/><br/>Tamas and Smyth told GBH News that Lyons was supportive of their run until the pair expressed support for keeping Baker and other moderate elected officials on the party&#39;s governing board. After that conversation and falling out, Smyth said, Lyons reviewed the newly reorganized boards and called for the Zoom meetings.<br/><br/>&quot;With the convention coming up, the goal of some people in this party, including the chairman, I believe, is to keep Gov. Baker off of the primary ballot to clear the way for Geoff Diehl,&quot; Corriveau said.",Mike Deehan,Thu Apr 22 18:33:29 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their connection saves the day.<br/><br/>This brief moment local radio captured on a 1993 LP was at the front of mind as I listened to an entirely different album released some 18 years later: <i><a href=""https://www.ecmrecords.com/shop/1603290520/uneasy-vijay-iyer-linda-may-han-oh-tyshawn-sorey"" target=""_blank"">Uneasy</a></i>, the pandemic drop from pianist Vijay Iyer. Or rather, it’s Vijay Iyer <i>plus</i> bassist Linda May Han Oh <i>plus</i> percussionist Tyshawn Sorey — each of these musicians shares in the labor equally and is credited as such. Individually, the members of this trio harness the vibrations of their sound machines with the deftest of touches and command a great deal of respect from the artistic community; as leaders they seem more then well-equipped to take on even the most grueling musical challenges. But here they combine their forces and form their own Voltron.<br/><br/>They operate in similar orbits — for starters, Iyer and Sorey are both Genius Grant recipients.

Sorey and I never crossed paths as closely, but I was confused for him twice in three days by <i>the same woman</i> at <i>two</i> different venues (she wasn’t too keen on my observation that all Black people, in fact, do not look alike).

Article,"With A Drone And Patience, Scientists Track Endangered Right Whale In Cape Cod Bay","With A Drone And Patience, Scientists Track Endangered Right Whale In Cape Cod Bay","On a recent cool, windy day, a team of scientists aboard a weathered 55-foot sailboat motored across Cape Cod Bay toward Provincetown, where dozens of North Atlantic right whales had been spotted days earlier.<br/><br/>“A bunch of whales were seen on a line between the mouth of Barnstable Harbor to Wood End off Provincetown. So we’re going to head that way,” said team leader Michael Moore, a veterinarian and scientist with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI).<br/><br/>The goal of Moore’s years-long research is to evaluate whether North Atlantic right whales are growing in healthy ways. The whales are nearing the end of a three-month period during which nearly half the population of approximately 360 can be spotted in Cape Cod Bay.<br/><br/>It’s a unique opportunity for researchers to take stock of the critically endangered species.<br/><br/>“Today I’m hoping to find some whales and get some drone photographs of them to measure them, figure out how fat and long they are, and see how that compares to the last time we saw them,” he said.<br/><br/>To Moore, it’s a mistake to gauge the health of this species based on population numbers alone. More than 80 percent of the survivors bear scars of entanglement in rope and fishing gear, but little is known about how the trauma impacts their ability to repopulate.<br/><br/>“All the news and the noise right now is, ‘Whose rope killed this whale?’” Moore said. “It&#39;s not just about killing whales. It&#39;s also about the health of the animals that are still alive and their ability to get pregnant or not. And that&#39;s a much more subtle, more nuanced question.”<br/><br/>The least-invasive way to measure a right whale, he added, is to use a drone rigged with a specialized camera that can hover over the whales. It can also help researchers know which particular whale they’re looking at.<br/><br/>“Right whales are beautifully equipped for drone work in terms of identification,” he said. “They wear their identity on their heads in the form of callosities,” which are massive calluses that are unique to each individual whale. “So every time we take a photograph, we know who it is.”<br/><br/>Researchers maintain a catalog of these whale images to keep track of who&#39;s who: which whales are alive, where are they moving, and whether they have new scars.<br/><br/>But on this day, after five hours on the water, more than 30 miles travelled, and a redirection back towards waters just north of Plymouth, Moore’s team had still not seen a single whale.<br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1619623228740,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-dc2f-d0a5-a176-fe6fe6080000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1619623228740,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-dc2f-d0a5-a176-fe6fe6080000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000179-1910-d8d9-ad7d-999c29fa0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000179-1910-d2db-af7b-7d18167b0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000179-1910-d2db-af7b-7d1816490000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">Amy Knowlton Searches for Whales</bsp-image><br/>Then, Amy Knowlton, a senior scientist with the New England Aquarium, caught sight of a fluke, emerging triumphantly out of the water.<br/><br/>“Oh, there it is!” she called out.<br/><br/>But the massive whale was 300 meters away and diving for five to 12 minutes at a time. It took another two-and-a-half hours – and many tense moments of searching – before the team could get close enough and the whale stopped diving. Finally, they got so close, they could hear the whoosh of misty air and vapor puffing out of its blowhole.<br/><br/>“His mouth was open there,” Knowlton said, as the shutter of her camera whirred.<br/><br/>Recognizing the limited window for data collection, Michael Moore readied himself on the deck with the drone. The sky was beginning to darken, and he knew he would have just this final chance to capture the essential data.<br/><br/>He and fellow WHOI scientist Carolyn Miller stood at the bow. Wearing a white helmet, she held the foot-long drone above her head and Moore launched it out of her hands, 200 feet into the pale blue sky. She sat down, watching an iPad and directing Moore as he piloted the drone.<br/><br/>“Forward, and right, and right,” she called. “Forward, forward, forward, forward, right, right, right, right.”<br/><br/>The two were in sync as the drone camera flew directly above the whale.<br/><br/>“These are great shots,” Miller said.<br/><br/>On the screen, the shiny, blue-black whale, with its mouth open, fed on a reddish plankton called copepods. At one point, it turned on its side, revealing its belly, as it began to change directions.<br/><br/>As the sun began to set, the team got the shot that would allow for clear measurements and a solid ID for the whale: a 13-year-old juvenile male familiar to researchers.<br/><br/>His name is Garlic, and he’s known to have been entangled at least three times: in 2009, 2015, and again in 2018. All have left indelible scars.<br/><br/>“Let&#39;s go home. Thanks, guys,” Moore said to the crew, “We got some data!”<br/><br/>“You got it,” Knowlton said.<br/><br/>“Thank goodness,” Miller echoed.<br/><br/>“After all that,” Moore laughed, “we got some data.”<br/><br/>By day’s end, tired but satisfied, the researchers had spent 11 hours on the water. Armed with fresh information about Garlic – a whale that represents the potential future of the dwindling species, and also the threats it faces – they planned to get some rest and return to the bay the next morning.<br/>",Eve Zuckoff,Thu Apr 29 06:00:11 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Article,Fitchburg Police Will Not Charge Homeless Shelter Director In Connection With Assault Allegations,Fitchburg Police Will Not Charge Homeless Shelter Director In Connection With Assault Allegations,"A director of Fitchburg’s only year-round homeless shelter will not be charged by local police following allegations that he assaulted homeless clients. <br/><br/>The Fitchburg Police Department launched its investigation after several advocates for homeless individuals spoke out during a Jan. 12 Fitchburg Human Rights Commission meeting and accused Kevin MacLean of physically and sexually assaulting Our Father’s House shelter clients. <br/><br/>The police department closed the case April 20, concluding “there is insufficient evidence to move forward with any charges,” according to a police report obtained by GBH News. That determination was made in consultation with an assistant district attorney, the report said. <br/><br/>Fitchburg Police Chief Ernest Martineau declined to comment beyond the police report. <br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1620250610264,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-e14f-d0a5-a176-fb6f31550000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1620250610264,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-e14f-d0a5-a176-fb6f31550000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000177-b603-d9bf-a5f7-b6df4c630003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000178-1865-dd2a-a3fb-dde724ab0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000177-e08e-dd7d-adf7-e3effb9e0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000179-3e75-ddcd-a57f-fffd5fec0019&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000179-3e75-ddcd-a57f-fffd5f5b0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>Our Father’s House Board of Directors placed MacLean, its director of homelessness, on paid administrative leave Feb. 26, pending the outcome of its own investigation of the allegations raised by advocates. That investigation is being conducted by outside attorney Robert Hennigan Jr. <br/><br/>Doug Pizzi, Our Father’s House spokesperson, confirmed its investigation is on-going. <br/><br/>&quot;The conclusion of the Fitchburg Police Department investigation will have no bearing on Our Father&#39;s House&#39;s inquiry,” Pizzi wrote in an email. “When it is completed, the findings will be presented to the Board. The Board will review the findings, take any action deemed necessary and notify all appropriate parties.” <br/><br/>A phone message left on MacLean&#39;s’ home phone requesting comment was not returned. <br/><br/>According to the police report, investigators found no victims of sexual assault among the more than 20 people interviewed. <br/><br/>&quot;Although I have had several individuals tell me they have heard of or know of instances, none of those individuals have given me any information on actual victims,&quot; the report stated. <br/><br/>Police determined an allegation reported by GBH News that MacLean physically assaulted Christopher Cattel was Cattel&#39;s fault. <br/><br/>&quot;It is clear that the altercation that took place was because Chris was the aggressor and Kevin acted in accordance with Our Father&#39;s House policy in how to handle a situation like that,&quot; the report stated. <br/><br/>Among those interviewed by police were two of the four advocates who raised allegations about MacLean — Susan Bucchholz and Tara Rivera, according to the police report. Rivera said, in an interview Wednesday, that she stands by the allegations. <br/><br/>“I am officially disheartened and disappointed in our system, in our leadership, in our local government,” Rivera said. “And I would really love to see the state and the federal government step in and do what our local officials cannot — justice, reform, keeping our homeless population safe and treating them the way that they deserve to be treated with humanity and respect and dignity.” <br/><br/>State Rep. Natalie Higgins, D-Leominster, who has advocated on behalf of the homeless to increase shelter services in the region, said she’s heard from multiple homeless individuals who said they will not speak with police about any concerns they have. <br/><br/>“I&#39;m concerned that this was set up in a way to be completely inaccessible to a marginalized population of homeless residents who don&#39;t believe that their story is going to be heard or taken seriously,” Higgins said. <br/><br/>Higgins again called for an outside investigation into all the allegations related to Our Father’s House brought to light by GBH News. Those allegations include verbal and sexual harassment of former employees, discrimination of homeless clients and falsifying shelter documents.<br/><br/>Contacted by GBH News, a spokesperson for Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said the office is seeking more information from Our Father’s House to determine if further action is needed. <br/><br/>“What’s been reported about Our Father’s House is very concerning. We are in the process of reaching out to get more information,” Healey&#39;s spokeswoman Jillian Fennimore wrote in an email. <br/><br/>Spokespeople for the state Department of Housing and Community Development and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development have declined to comment. <br/>In addition to its 30-bed shelter, the Our Father’s House organization runs street outreach across north central Massachusetts, transitional housing in Fitchburg for women in recovery, a sober home in Leominster for men in recovery, family transitional housing for homeless women with children, and a community food pantry available to households once monthly, according to its website. <br/><br/>The annual homeless count conducted by HUD found 100 homeless individuals in the region. <br/><br/>Higgins is among those who worked to open a temporary shelter for adults at the Leominster Days Inn. That program, which is run by South Middlesex Opportunity Council, has been extended through June. <br/><br/>Higgins said she is working with the state Department of Housing and Community Development, which partially funds adult homeless shelters, on a longer-term permanent plan to address the needs of the region’s homeless.

He saw the name John Freeman in a family genealogy and realized the same name was on the sanctuary wall, right where his gaze falls when he’s sitting with the choir.<br/><br/>“Oh, that&#39;s cool,” he recalls thinking to himself. “Like, I&#39;ve moved back to this town in 2006, and I&#39;ve got this historic connection to the church that I didn&#39;t even know I had.”<br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1620771127974,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-e14f-d0a5-a176-fb6f31550000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1620771127974,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-e14f-d0a5-a176-fb6f31550000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;migration.alignment&quot;:&quot;LEFT&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000179-527e-df8c-ad7d-d2fe20d30001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000179-527e-d2ba-a97f-57fe0c160000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000179-527e-d2ba-a97f-57fe0b7a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">First Church Plaque</bsp-image><br/>In 21st century fashion, he went looking online for more about Freeman. What he found makes the anti-racism work happening at First Parish Brewster very personal.<br/><br/>The church has a task force focused on reparations — reparations for the enslavement of people of color, and potentially for the taking of Wampanoag land.<br/><br/>Ross found Freeman’s will. In it, he left a vast tract of land stretching basically to the Orleans line.<br/><br/>Listed somewhere between the land and his bedroom furniture, said Ross, was something like this: “I hereby bequeath my Negro man, Hamsheir, to my wife and son.”<br/><br/>“And that took me aback,” he said. “Because, you know, like a lot of New Englanders, I just did not equate this part of the country, especially at that time, with enslavement.”<br/><br/>So when Rev. Jessica Clay called on the congregation to research its history and consider reparations, he joined the task force.<br/><br/>One of the leaders is 27-year-old Abigail Walters, who grew up in the congregation.<br/><br/>She said the task force is developing a list of names — not the venerated surnames in the old burial ground, but the people recorded by first name only.<br/><br/>She read them aloud, slowly. &quot;Sarah, James, Jesse, Hannah, Oliver, Jolly, Jack, Hamsheir, Anna, Mary, James, Molly, and Mille.”<br/><br/>They were enslaved by members of the church, along with five others listed with no name at all.<br/><br/>“And that was something we ran into a lot — this idea of the silence of the archives,” she said. “Archives aren&#39;t neutral places; they&#39;re created. And the Western archival tradition has really prioritized preserving the story of the white, rich, and powerful.”<br/><br/>The task force is getting ready to make recommendations to the congregation in June. They’re talking about committing a portion of the endowment and operating budget to reparations, acknowledging and apologizing for the harm, and creating a learning trail to educate the public.<br/><br/>Walters said there are a few important things to remember. One, New England benefitted from slavery in ways that aren’t always obvious.<br/><br/>“Fishermen sold salted cod to the West Indies to feed enslaved people on the plantations there because it was very cheap to do so,” she said.<br/><br/>She said people doing this work need to center the needs of descendants, and not act like the congregation has all the answers.<br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1620609184845,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-dc2f-d0a5-a176-fe6fe6080000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1620609184845,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-dc2f-d0a5-a176-fe6fe6080000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000179-53d4-d9cb-a77d-73fe3b390001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000179-53d4-d99c-a57f-d7df1ced0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000179-53d4-d99c-a57f-d7df1cb20000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">First Church Graveyard</bsp-image><br/>“And I think the most important part of this is really understanding that this is an ongoing commitment to reparations. ... Dismantling racism within ourselves and institutions — like, we can&#39;t undo 400 years of oppression and in one year,” she said.<br/><br/>First Parish Brewster’s is one of a number of projects around the region looking at racism in community history and taking action for change.<br/><br/>In Woods Hole, residents Paula Pace and Ruth Gainer spearheaded an effort to rename a road that bore the name of 19th century naturalist Louis Agassiz.<br/><br/>Agassiz promoted the idea that different races were created separately by God, and he considered Black people biologically inferior to whites.<br/><br/>A small committee of local residents successfully petitioned the Falmouth Select Board to name the road to honor cell biologist, professor, and university president Jewel Cobb.<br/><br/>Gainer said it feels like no small feat.<br/><br/>“Although it may seem like a trivial thing compared to what needs to be done in this country, it&#39;s still it&#39;s still a very significant thing for us who reside in the area and who want to see the town become a more welcoming, equitable, and diverse place,” she said.<br/><br/>Cobb had a long association with the Marine Biological Laboratory and was recognized as the first African-American woman to head a major university in the western United States.<br/><br/>The committee is organizing an exhibit on Cobb and the name change.<br/><br/>At First Parish Brewster, Reverend Clay said there’s a lot more to be done to acknowledge historical and ongoing harm and eradicate white supremacy.<br/><br/>“Not from a place of shame,” she said, “ but from a place of hope and liberation for all.”",Jennette Barnes,Wed May 12 02:00:27 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,MBTA Reviews New Proposal To Change Fare Evasion Rules,MBTA Reviews New Proposal To Change Fare Evasion Rules,"The MBTA reviewed a new proposal Monday that would decriminalize fare evasion and lower fines for people who use buses and trains without paying.<br/><br/>The plan includes lowering the fine to $50 for the first, second and third offense. The ticket would increase to $100 for subsequent offenses. Currently, the fines are $100 for first offense, $200 for a second offense, and $600 for any third or subsequent offenses.<br/><br/>In January, Massachusetts legislators passed a bill prohibiting the arrest of fare violators on the T partially in response to criticism that enforcement has fallen disproportionately on lower income people of color who can’t afford the fines, and did little to stop people from evading fares. The proposal reviewed today also included provisions to create a civilian &quot;fare verification&quot; team of 80 to 120 inspectors who could issue non-criminal citations — a job that only MBTA transit police have the authority to do now.<br/><br/>Some advocates were pushing to lower the fines even further to $10, but T officials said that would not be an effective deterrent. The MBTA did, however, scratch part of the proposal that would have prevented people who refused to pay the fine from being able to renew their driver&#39;s license.<br/><br/>About 1% of T passengers overall evade fares across the system. On the Green Line and Commuter Rail, that figure rises to anywhere between five and ten percent, according to a recent T report. The T loses about 10-20 million dollars a year because of fare evasion. <br/><br/>The Fiscal Control Board will vote on the draft regulations at its next meeting on May 24.

Article,Former Fall River Mayor Jasiel Correia Found Guilty Of Tax Fraud And Extortion ,Former Fall River Mayor Jasiel Correia Found Guilty Of Tax Fraud And Extortion ,"Former Fall River Mayor Jasiel Correia on Friday was found guilty of 21 counts of extortion and tax fraud by a jury in U.S. District Court in Boston.<br/><br/>The decision came after more than four days of deliberations in the case after jurors heard from 36 witnesses in a nine-day trial at the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse located on the Boston waterfront.<br/><br/>Correia faced two dozen charges ranging from tax fraud to extortion and bribery. He pleaded not guilty to defrauding investors in a tech start up and denied shaking down marijuana vendors to fund a lavish lifestyle that allegedly included a Mercedes Benz, designer clothes and other luxury items.<br/><br/>The jury found Correia not guilty on only three charges he faced for bribery, extortion and extortion conspiracy.<br/><br/>Prosecutors called him “a mayor of old-school corruption.” In closing arguments, U.S. Attorney Zachary Hafer said the evidence of lying, cheating, and stealing was overwhelming and Correa would say anything to get what he wanted.<br/><br/>But defense attorneys pointed to what they called a “Conga Line” of witness plea agreements and tried to cast doubt on their testimony.<br/><br/>Correia, who insisted he was innocent and attacked the charges as politically motivated, never took the stand. Outside the courthouse, he told reporters he planned to appeal.<br/><br/>&quot;We’ll win that appeal, and I will be vindicated,” he said. “This is not a great day, but I&#39;ve had other not-great days and everybody here knows that, that&#39;s watched this unfold. But we&#39;re going to have a great day of vindication and eventually, the real truth will come out.”<br/><br/>Correia was released but must wear a GPS tracking bracelet. His sentencing date is set for Sept. 20. <br/><br/>Prosecutors successfully portrayed Correia as a con man, saying he scammed investors in his phone app out of tens of thousands of dollars.<br/><br/>Assistant U.S. Attorney Zach Hafer told jurors that Correia was “a politician who betrayed the investors in his startup company by stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars and a politician who betrayed his constituents by selling his power to enrich himself.”<br/><br/>Acting U.S. Attorney Nathaniel Mendell called the verdict “a fitting end to this saga.”<br/><br/>“Correia made a lot of promises, a lot of bold statements in business, in politics and in government,” Mendell said. “The jury found today, in its verdict, the truth.”<br/><br/>Correia’s lawyer, Kevin Reddington, had argued his client wasn’t a criminal, but merely an inexperienced businessman who believed that he was free to use investors’ money as he deemed fit while he was producing the smartphone app.<br/><br/>Throughout the trial, prosecutors portrayed Correia as a serial liar, who they said misled voters in order to get elected just like they said he duped investors. In a clip shown to jurors from a 2015 debate during the race for mayor, Correia promised taxpayers that he would “take your money and spend it wisely” — because he said that’s what he had done in his business. His lie about how he previously sold another app for big money allowed him avoid questions about how he could afford such a lavish lifestyle on his $17,000 annual salary as a Fall River city councilor, prosecutors said.<br/><br/>After the Democrat took office as mayor in 2016, prosecutors say Correia quickly turned to “old school pay-to-play political corruption,” by soliciting bribes from marijuana vendors seeking to operate in Fall River. Marijuana business owners, who were given immunity to testify against Correia, told jurors about how Correia or middlemen negotiated bribes in exchange for letters of approval from the city they need in order to get a license.<br/><br/>Correia’s lawyer attacked the credibility and sought to shift the blame onto the government’s witnesses who had cooperation agreements with prosecutors, suggesting they were lying in an effort to help themselves.<br/><br/>One man, who pleaded guilty in the extortion scheme, told jurors about how he collected an envelope filled with $25,000 in cash that a middleman had put in a shed behind his home. The witness, Hildegar Camara, said he opened the envelope in front of Correia and got spooked, telling the mayor, “If you take this or I take this, we’re going to go to jail.”<br/><br/>Another man, who was hoping to operate a marijuana business in Fall River, described how Correia showed up at his family’s store and asked for $250,000, saying he needed it for legal defense fees. After Correia and Charles Saliby eventually agreed on a lower bribe, Correia’s chief of staff told Saliby: “You’re family now,” according to Saliby’s testimony.<br/><br/>Jurors acquitted Correia of two extortion counts related to a scheme involving a Rolex watch and one count of bribery stemming from accusations that he convinced his chief of staff to kickback part of her salary to him.<br/><br/>Correia’s lawyers argued it wasn’t a bribe but a loan from a mother-like figure to Correia. And though his chief of staff pleaded guilty to charges including extortion and bribery, she never took the stand to testify against Correia.","Chris Burell, Jenifer McKim | GBH News and Alanna Durkin Richer|Associated Press",Fri May 14 12:24:39 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Article,'The Very Hungry Caterpillar' Author Eric Carle Dies At 91,'The Very Hungry Caterpillar' Author Eric Carle Dies At 91,"Eric Carle, the beloved children’s author and illustrator whose classic “The Very Hungry Caterpillar” and other works gave millions of kids some of their earliest and most cherished literary memories, has died at age 91.<br/><br/>Carle&#39;s family says he died Sunday at his summer studio in Northampton, Massachusetts, with family members at his side. The family&#39;s announcement was issued by Penguin Young Readers.<br/><br/>“Heaven just got more colorful,” Peter H. Reynolds, author and illustrator of “The Dot,” wrote <a href=""https://twitter.com/peterhreynolds/status/1397690188311187464"">in tribute on Twitter.</a> Carle, he said, “made his mark, splashing bravely and inspiring those around him to do the same.”<br/><br/>Through books like “Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?” “Do You Want to Be My Friend?” and “From Head to Toe,” Carle introduced universal themes in simple words and bright colors. <br/><br/>“The unknown often brings fear with it,” he once observed. “In my books I try to counteract this fear, to replace it with a positive message. I believe that children are naturally creative and eager to learn. I want to show them that learning is really both fascinating and fun.” <br/><br/>“The Very Hungry Caterpillar,” published in 1969, was welcomed by parents and delighted kids with its story of the metamorphosis of a green and red caterpillar to a proudly multi-colored butterfly. <br/><br/>Originally conceived as a book about a bookworm — called “A Week with Willi the Worm” — the hero, who eats through 26 different foods, was changed to a caterpillar on the advice of his editor. It has sold some 40 million copies and has been translated into 60 languages, spawned stuffed animal caterpillars and has been turned into a stage play.<br/><br/>“I remember that as a child, I always felt I would never grow up and be big and articulate and intelligent,” Carle told The New York Times in 1994. ”&#39;Caterpillar’ is a book of hope: you, too, can grow up and grow wings.”<br/><br/>Politicians like George W. Bush and Hillary Clinton were known to read the book to children on the campaign trail. The American Academy of Pediatrics sent more than 17,000 pediatricians special copies of the book, along with growth charts and parent handouts on healthy eating. Fellow writer and illustrator Ted Dewan called the book one of the pillars of children’s culture. “It’s almost talking about how great the Beatles were. It’s beyond reproach,” he said.<br/><br/>Carle wrote and-or illustrated more than 75 books, sometimes partnering with Bill Martin Jr. or other authors, but most with Carle working alone. One of his last books was 2015′s “The Nonsense Show,” which centered on a parade of flying fish, cat-taming mice and circus animals.<br/><br/>“To have spent some time with Eric Carle was the closest thing one could get to hanging out with the actual Santa Claus. His books and his advocacy for the arts will continue to ripple through time. But we in the children’s book community will miss him terribly,” National Book Award finalist Jarrett J. Krosoczka wrote on Twitter.<br/><br/>Born to German immigrant parents in Syracuse, New York, Carle and his family returned to Germany — Nazi Germany, at the time —- when he was 6. Under the Nazis, modern, expressionistic and abstract art was banned and only realistic and naturalistic art was permitted. <br/><br/>When Carle was 12 or 13, a high school art teacher would change his life by inviting him to his home, where he secretly showed his expressionist art, including Franz Marc’s “Blue Horse.” <br/><br/>“I was used to pretty paintings with a mountain in the background. Although I was shocked, I always carried that day in my heart,” Carle told NPR in 2011. As an illustrator, he said he chose to portray animals in unconventional colors to show his young readers that in art, there is no wrong color. He thanked Marc in the pages of “The Artist Who Painted a Blue Horse.” <br/><br/>His signature illustration technique was done by piecing pictures together chiefly from tissue paper that he had painted with various colors and textures. “It sounds corny, but I think I connect with the child in me, and I think others do, too,” he told The Associated Press in 2003.<br/><br/>His father introduced him to the wonders of the living creatures that he would later immortalize in his books. “When I was a small child, as far back as I can remember, he would take me by the hand and we would go out in nature,” he told The New York Times in 1994. “And he would show me worms and bugs and bees and ants and explain their lives to me. It was a very loving relationship.”<br/><br/>The theme of kids mastering the world was tackled in other tales of critters with “very” big predicaments: “The Very Busy Spider,” “The Very Quiet Cricket,” “The Very Lonely Firefly” and “Friends.” The love of family was explored in such books as “Papa, Please Get the Moon for Me,” 1986; and “Does a Kangaroo Have a Mother, Too?” from 2000.<br/><br/>After graduating from a leading German art school, he returned to the United States in 1952. He worked as a graphic designer in the promotion department of The New York Times before switching to advertising.<br/><br/>It was Martin who spotted Carle’s talents and brought him into the publishing field. Carle was working as an art director for an advertising agency at the time; Martin had just written “Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?” and needed an illustrator.<br/><br/>“While waiting for a dentist appointment, I came across an ad he had done that featured a Maine lobster,” Martin, who died in 2004, told the AP in 2003. “The art was so striking that I knew instantly that I had found my artist!”<br/><br/>The book, which introduces colors and animals to young readers, came out in 1967 and became a perennial bestseller. Their other joint works were 1991′s “Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What Do You Hear?” and 2003′s “Panda Bear, Panda Bear, What Do You See?”<br/><br/>In 2002, Carle and his late wife, Barbara Carle, founded The Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art. Based in Amherst, Massachusetts, the nonprofit, 40,000-square-foot arts center is a showcase for picture book illustrations from around the world. He received lifetime achievement awards from the National Endowment for the Arts and the American Library Association.<br/><br/>He is survived by a son and a daughter. <br/><br/><i>AP National Writer Hillel Italie contributed to this story.</i><br/>","Mark Kennedy, Associated Press",Wed May 26 21:47:41 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On Wednesday, the federal judge overseeing the case allowed that deal to move forward, and ruled the same protections should be granted to the Sackler&#39;s individually.<br/><br/><b>&quot;</b>Unfortunately, we&#39;ve seen the Sacklers essentially try to hijack and abuse the bankruptcy process to block our law enforcement efforts, and it really should not be allowed,&quot; Healey told GBH News on Thursday. &quot;The Sacklers, as with Purdue, need to be held accountable for the wrong they did to the families who suffered such devastation in the opioid crisis.&quot;<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1622756483877,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-e4be-dadb-a77e-f5be3b2c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1622756483877,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-e4be-dadb-a77e-f5be3b2c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;Related Stories&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000179-cf2b-dcfc-a1fd-dffb7dbc0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000168-5868-d428-af68-dbebeb660003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000016d-cfb8-dd16-a77f-fffa26cd0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000179-d3d1-d872-a5f9-f3d12b110001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000179-d3d1-d872-a5f9-f3d128d10000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>While the company has declared bankruptcy, the Sackler family is among the richest in the country, Healey said, and shouldn&#39;t get protection from lawsuits.<br/><br/>&quot;They&#39;re not saying they&#39;re bankrupt,&quot; Healey said of the Sacklers. &quot;They can&#39;t say that, because they have billions and billions of dollars. What they&#39;re saying is that the bankruptcy court should basically let them pay the states and cities some money and then be done with this. And we say no, because the money that they&#39;re offering is not enough. It&#39;s not good enough. And it is an insult to the families who suffered so much as a result of their conduct.&quot;<br/><br/>The Sackler family denies any wrongdoing and says members of the family on the company&#39;s board acted &quot;ethically and lawfully.&quot; They set up a <a href=""https://www.judgeforyourselves.info/"">website</a> to defend the company and family from what they say are &quot;unsubstantiated allegations.&quot;<br/><br/>Purdue&#39;s plan to settle all the lawsuits against the company involves a payment of more than 4 billion dollars, which would be split among the many plaintiffs. Healey&#39;s office estimates Massachusetts would receive between four and six million dollars a year over the next several years.<br/><br/>Healey said the state will continue to oppose the settlement in bankruptcy court and any extension of protections to the Sackler family. The proposed settlement will be put to a vote by hundreds of thousands of claimants by a deadline of July 14. <br/><br/>&quot;And we&#39;ll vote no, because this just isn&#39;t good enough, it&#39;s not good enough for the families and it does not meet the measure of justice that is required in this case or of accountability,&quot; said Healey.<br/><br/>U.S. Reps. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., and Mark DeSaulnier, D-CA, have filed federal legislation known as the <a href=""https://oversight.house.gov/news/press-releases/maloney-desaulnier-introduce-sackler-act-to-prevent-bad-actors-from-evading"">SACKLER Act</a>, that would prevent people who haven&#39;t filed for bankruptcy from being released from liability through bankruptcy proceedings. Healey is <a href=""https://oversight.house.gov/legislation/hearings/the-sackler-act-and-other-policies-to-promote-accountability-for-the-sackler"">set to testify</a> virtually in favor of that legislation next Tuesday before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.<br/><br/>One provision in Purdue&#39;s proposed settlement that Healey called &quot;perverse and inappropriate&quot; would transform the pharmaceutical company into a so-called &quot;public benefit company&quot; with future profits being used by states to fund efforts to address the opioid crisis. <br/><br/>&quot;We want no part of that,&quot; Healey said.<br/> <br/>That part of the plan would present an inherent conflict of interest for states, said Dr. Andrew Kolodny, medical director of the Opioid Policy Research Collaborative at Brandeis University.<br/><br/>&quot;States should not be in the business of profiting off of future sales of opioids in order to address the crisis,&quot; said Kolodny, who previously served as an expert witness in the state of Oklahoma&#39;s case against Purdue. &quot;States should be doing everything they can to promote more cautious prescribing of opioids so that less people become addicted, and so the epidemic ultimately comes to an end.&quot;<br/><br/>Kolodny said he doesn&#39;t believe the states would get much profit from the sale of Oxycontin, anyway.<br/><br/>&quot;One of the reasons that Perdue was going into bankruptcy wasn&#39;t simply all of the lawsuits against Perdue, but sales of OxyContin have been decreasing because there&#39;s generic competition. There is now generic OxyContin. And so there&#39;s really no reason to believe that there&#39;s much value in Purdue&#39;s products.&quot;<br/><br/>The Sackler family&#39;s move to be shielded from lawsuits has far-reaching implications, Kolodny said.<br/><br/>&quot;There are important concerns here, not just for the opioid crisis, but for other public health problems that are caused by corporate greed,&quot; he said. &quot;If individuals that make decisions that lead to a massive loss of life are able to walk away billionaires, then it sets a very bad precedent.&quot;",Craig LeMoult,Thu Jun 03 19:02:20 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Charlie Baker said Friday he has transferred $109 million to Randolph, Everett, Methuen and Chelsea to make up for a shortfall in what the communities recieved from federal pandemic relief money. The communities were very hard hit by COVID but were shortchanged because of a problem in the way the federal funding formula was applied.<br/><br/>The money Baker released comes from the state&#39;s own $5.3 billion share of the American Rescue Plan Act funds passed by Congress. Baker and the legislature have been squabbling over which branch of government has the authority to spend that money.<br/><br/>Lawmakers are moving a bill through their chambers to take control of the entire $5.3 billion out of Baker&#39;s hands so they can develop a process for appropriating it. That bill did not arrive on Baker&#39;s desk before the governor himself sent the four towns the $109 million they were promised. It was unclear Friday whether legislative leaders condoned Baker&#39;s move or were even aware of it.<br/><br/>&quot;These four communities were disproportionately impacted by the virus, and this additional funding will support critical local COVID response and recovery efforts,&quot; Baker said, according to a press release from his office. <br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1622840511374,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-fe91-d9b7-abe6-feb1834f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1622840511374,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-fe91-d9b7-abe6-feb1834f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000179-ce99-dc72-aff9-defbc74c0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000179-81ce-df8c-ad7d-91ce76510003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000178-1821-dd2a-a3fb-dde73c130003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000179-d8c8-d872-a5f9-f9c9fc20002c&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000179-d8c8-d872-a5f9-f9c9fa080000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>Baker is granting $28.5 million to Chelsea, $26.3 million to Methuen, $33.3 million to Everett and $21 million to Randolph. <br/><br/>The state&#39;s two U.S. senators and U.S. Rep.

Article,State Officials Okay Half School Days During Heatwave,State Officials Okay Half School Days During Heatwave,"The combination of temperatures in the 90s, school buildings without air conditioning and COVID-19 safety protocols has some districts starting the week with plans to send students home early.<br/><br/>Heat-related half-days are permissible as long as schools still meet their required amount of student learning time for the year, but shifting to a remote day because of the extreme weather is not an option, the state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education told superintendents on Friday.<br/><br/>Ahead of the expected heatwave, Associate Commissioner Helene Bettencourt wrote to school leaders Friday afternoon, advising them that they &quot;may consider holding half days due to heat&quot; as long as they still fulfill their minimum student learning time (SLT) requirements of 850 hours for elementary schoolers and 935 in secondary schools. Those requirements are usually higher, but last summer, as schools prepared to open under new pandemic operating models, state education officials and teachers unions struck a deal to cut the required number of school days this year from 180 to 170 to allow more time for planning.<br/><br/>For schools where a half day would mean the annual hours requirement would not be met, Bettencourt wrote that &quot;districts should cancel school in the event of a heat day and plan to extend their school year by one day to make up the day and the hours.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Please note: Districts and schools cannot shift all students to remote learning on these days and have those days and hours count towards a districts&#39; SLT requirements of 170 days and 850/935 hours,&quot; the email said.<br/><br/>Schools abruptly transitioned to remote learning last spring as the coronavirus first took hold in Massachusetts, and most have now returned to fully in-person instruction. In March, the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education voted 8-3 to give Commissioner Jeff Riley the authority to determine when remote schooling would no longer count toward student learning time requirements.<br/><br/>Riley set those dates at April 5 for elementary schools, April 28 for middle schools and May 17 for high schools, though a small number of districts were granted waivers allowing later deadlines. Families were also given the option to keep their child remote through the end of the academic year.<br/><br/>Officials in various districts across the state including Lowell, Winchester, Holyoke and Braintree announced plans to send students home early on Monday — and in some cases Tuesday — amid the heatwave.<br/><br/>&quot;Heat in June is always an issue, but this year it is worsened by the mask-wearing mandate,&quot; <a href=""https://www.graftonps.org/site/default.aspx?PageType=3&amp;DomainID=4&amp;ModuleInstanceID=10448&amp;ViewID=6446EE88-D30C-497E-9316-3F8874B3E108&amp;RenderLoc=0&amp;FlexDataID=15439&amp;PageID=1"" style=""color: rgb(0, 106, 199); text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-skip-ink: none;"">read a notice</a> from the Grafton Public Schools announcing the two early-release days. &quot;Monday and Tuesday are expected to be the hottest days, with temperatures reaching 95.

Article,"Local Control At Risk Under Redstricting Plans, Galvin Says","Local Control At Risk Under Redstricting Plans, Galvin Says","As local officials wait for the U.S. Census Bureau to provide community-specific population data, Secretary of State William Galvin said Monday that legislation to put Congressional and legislative redistricting ahead of local reprecinting would be &quot;devastating&quot; to city and towns, putting him at odds with voting rights advocates.<br/><br/>Galvin, the state&#39;s chief elections official, testified before a legislative committee that it would be a mistake to pass a bill that would reverse the order of the reprecinting and redistricting, arguing that it would strip the authority of local government to define its own political geography.<br/><br/>&quot;I will urge the governor to veto this is if if gets to that point. I believe he will,&quot; Galvin said.<br/><br/>But advocates say the change would allow the Committee on Redistricting to draw more precise and equitable House, Senate and Congressional districts without worrying about creating confusion for voters by subdividing local precincts.<br/><br/>It would also give the Legislature more time to finalize state and federal district maps before November, which is the time when lawmakers planning to seek reelection must make sure they reside within their new district boundaries.<br/><br/>Assistant House Majority Leader Michael Moran has filed a bill (H 820) that would remove the June 15 deadline for cities and towns to redraw local precinct boundaries, and instead require the Legislature to first redraw the boundaries for state and federal offices. Local governments would then conform their precincts to fit in the new districts.<br/><br/>The change would allow the Committee on Redistricting to use Census tracts and blocks to build new districts, which must reflect the growth in population in Massachusetts that has climbed 7.4 percent over the past 10 years to 7,029,917 people.<br/><br/>Supporters say these building blocks are smaller and more precise than local wards and precincts and will allow the Redistricting Committee to more easily create districts that are not only equal in size, but also ones that keep ethnic and racial communities together.<br/><br/>Moran did not testify on his legislation, but members of a coalition of voting rights groups known as the Drawing Democracy Coalition weighed in with their support.<br/><br/>&quot;This legislation is going to be that imperative fix to continue to recognize the values of equity and racial justice here in the commonwealth so we can continue to draw district lines and have the Redistricting Committee have the flexibility to increase political power in communities of color,&quot; said Rahsaan Hall, director of the racial justice program with the ACLU of Massachusetts.<br/><br/>Galvin argued that local governments are best suited to adapt to the population changes that have occurred over the last decade. While he advised against using Census blocks to redraw districts, he said there is nothing stopping the Legislature from doing so if it wanted.<br/><br/>In the past, Galvin said his office has had to accommodate state and federal districts that didn&#39;t follow precinct boundaries by giving voters in those precincts different ballots. While confusing and less than ideal, Galvin said he would do it again if necessary.<br/><br/>&quot;Have there been new ethnic communities come in? Have there been changes? Is there new construction? Are there new factors? Local governments are best able to deal with this,&quot; Galvin said",Matt Murphy | State House News Service,Mon Jun 07 15:03:18 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,Local Alzheimer's Patients And Families Hail New Biogen Drug As Landmark,Local Alzheimer's Patients And Families Hail New Biogen Drug As Landmark,"Local Alzheimer’s patients, caregivers, advocates, and researchers, hailed the approval of Cambridge-based Biogen’s drug aducanumab on Monday as the first treatment that could slow the progression of the disease.<br/><br/>Greg O’Brien of Brewster is a former investigative reporter, and now an author who has lived with early onset Alzheimer’s for about a decade. He says he testified before an FDA panel last year in favor of aducanumab’s approval, which he calls “an answered prayer.”<br/><br/>Although he doesn’t think the drug will help him, because he is not in the early stages of the disease, O’ Brien tells GBH News, he supports the drug, “on the basis of hope.”<br/><br/>“If it clearly can be helpful and there&#39;s no harm, throw us a lifeline, give us some hope,” O’Brien said. &quot;And they did. And so I am so thrilled and so pleased and honored by what the FDA did.”<br/><br/>O’Brien said Alzheimer’s has plagued many close relatives in his family, including his mother, who he says suffered with it for years before telling anyone. He said giving people hope will encourage people to come forward with their diagnosis, which can lead to greater awareness and better funding for research.<br/><br/>“There is still a stigma connected with Alzheimer&#39;s and dementia,” said Jim Wessler,<b> </b>CEO of the Massachusetts-New Hampshire chapter of the Alzheimer&#39;s Association. He says polling confirms that, &quot;this is the most feared disease in America. It&#39;s more feared than cancer or heart disease.”<br/><br/>Wessler said his organization believes that only about 50-percent of those who have Alzheimer&#39;s are diagnosed; and of those who are diagnosed, only about half of those are told of their diagnosis.<br/><br/>“Now we have the first medication that will begin to make a difference… if I was a clinician and I had no tools that I thought really made a difference, I&#39;m going to be less inclined to jump into this because I don&#39;t think I can help my patients. Now, there is something that they can do that at least can begin to start helping to attack this disease.”<br/><br/>Wessler said having the first drug that clears out amyloid, a sort of sticky protein that accumulates in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s, could promise to give those people more time, especially those in early stages of the disease.<br/><br/>“And who wouldn&#39;t grab that time to see your daughter married, or visit a grandchild in another city,” Wessler said.<br/><br/>Kevin Reynolds of South Boston is a long-distance caregiver for his mother in the Atlanta area, and he’s also on the board of the Massachusetts-New Hampshire chapter of the Alzheimer&#39;s Association.<br/><br/>“When my mother was diagnosed 12 years ago, it was such a dark diagnosis,” Reynolds said. “So now if you have a drug that can treat this awful disease, you might also lead to more early diagnosis… this brings a lot of hope. And as you can imagine, when there&#39;s one drug, there should be more to follow.”<br/><br/>Alzheimer researcher Dr. Rudy Tanzi agrees; he’s a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and chair of the Cure for Alzheimer&#39;s Fund. He says drug breakthroughs for other diseases helped accelerate treatments, and he believes this will be the same for Alzheimer&#39;s.<br/><br/>“That&#39;s as big a day for Alzheimer&#39;s patients and families as it was for getting cholesterol medications out to reduce heart disease,” Tanzi said.<br/><br/>Wessler says the approval of aducanumab heralds a day when Alzheimer’s could be a chronic condition, as HIV is now.<br/><br/>“It&#39;s not a cure and it&#39;s not going to add twenty five years of cognitive health,” said Wessler, “but it is a step in the right direction. We’re in baseball season and this is a single, a solid single and we&#39;ll keep going for the next single. Maybe someday we&#39;ll have a grand slam.”<br/><br/><i>Marilyn Schairer contributed to this report.</i><br/>",Mark Herz,Mon Jun 07 22:41:54 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Article,"Israel Swears In New Coalition, Ending Netanyahu's Long Rule","Israel Swears In New Coalition, Ending Netanyahu's Long Rule","JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel&#39;s parliament on Sunday narrowly approved a new coalition government, ending the historic 12-year rule of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and sending the polarizing leader into the opposition.<br/><br/>Naftali Bennett, a former ally of Netanyahu turned rival, became prime minister after the 60-59 vote. Promising to try to heal a divided nation, Bennett will preside over a diverse and fragile coalition comprised of eight parties with deep ideological differences.<br/><br/>But the 71-year-old Netanyahu made clear he has no intention of exiting the political stage. &quot;If it is destined for us to be in the opposition, we will do it with our backs straight until we topple this dangerous government and return to lead the country,&quot; he said.<br/><br/>The vote, capping a stormy parliamentary session, ended a two-year cycle of political paralysis in which the country held four deadlocked elections. Those votes focused largely on Netanyahu&#39;s divisive rule and his fitness to remain in office while on trial for corruption charges.<br/><br/>To his supporters, Netanyahu is a global statesman uniquely capable of leading the country through its many security challenges. <br/><br/>But to his critics, he has become a polarizing and autocratic leader who used divide-and-rule tactics to aggravate the many rifts in Israeli society. Those include tensions between Jews and Arabs, and within the Jewish majority between his religious and nationalist base and his more secular and dovish opponents. <br/><br/>Outside the Knesset, hundreds of protesters watching the vote on a large screen erupted into applause when the new government was approved. Thousands of people, many waving Israeli flags, celebrated in central Tel Aviv&#39;s Rabin Square.<br/><br/>President Joe Biden quickly congratulated the new government.<br/><br/>&quot;I look forward to working with Prime Minister Bennett to strengthen all aspects of the close and enduring relationship between our two nations,&quot; he said in a statement. He said his administration is fully committed to working with the new government &quot;to advance security, stability, and peace for Israelis, Palestinians, and people throughout the broader region.&quot;<br/><br/>Bennett&#39;s office said he later spoke by phone with Biden, thanking him for his warm wishes and longstanding commitment to Israel&#39;s security. <br/><br/>The leaders agreed to consult closely on all matters related to regional security, including Iran, the White House said, adding that Biden said his administration intends to work closely with the Israeli government on advancing peace, security and prosperity for Israelis and Palestinians.<br/><br/>Much of the Israeli opposition to Netanyahu was personal. Three of the eight parties in the new government, including Bennett&#39;s Yamina, are headed by former Netanyahu allies who share his hard-line ideology but had deep personal disputes with him. <br/><br/>Bennett, 49, is a former chief of staff to Netanyahu whose small party is popular with religious Jews and West Bank settlers. As he addressed the raucous debate, he was repeatedly heckled and shouted down by Netanyahu&#39;s supporters. Some were removed from the chamber.<br/><br/>Bennett, an observant Jew, noted the Jewish people twice lost their homeland in biblical times due to bitter infighting.<br/><br/>&quot;This time, at the decisive moment, we have taken responsibility,&quot; he said. &quot;To continue on in this way -- more elections, more hatred, more vitriolic posts on Facebook -- is just not an option. Therefore we stopped the train, a moment before it barreled into the abyss.&quot;<br/><br/>The new Cabinet met briefly, and Bennett recited a prayer for new beginnings and said it was time to mend rifts. &quot;Citizens of Israel are all looking to us now, and the burden of proof is upon us,&quot; Bennett said.<br/><br/>The millionaire former high-tech entrepreneur faces a tough test maintaining an unwieldy coalition from the political right, left and center. <br/><br/>The coalition, including a small Islamist faction that is making history as the first Arab party to sit in a coalition, agree on little beyond their opposition to Netanyahu. They are likely to pursue a modest agenda that seeks to reduce tensions with the Palestinians and maintain good relations with the U.S. without launching any major initiatives.<br/><br/>&quot;We will forge forward on that which we agree — and there is much we agree on, transport, education and so on, and what separates us we will leave to the side,&quot; Bennett said. He also promised a &quot;new page&quot; in relations with Israel&#39;s Arab sector.<br/><br/>Israel&#39;s Arab citizens make up about 20% of the population but have suffered from discrimination, poverty and lack of opportunities. Netanyahu has often tried portray Arab politicians as terrorist sympathizers, though he also courted the same Arab party in a failed effort to remain in power after March 23 elections.<br/><br/>Bennett, who like Netanyahu opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state, made little mention of the Palestinians beyond threatening a tough response to violence. He also vowed, like Netanyahu, to oppose U.S.-led efforts to restore the international nuclear accord with Iran. <br/><br/>&quot;Israel will not allow Iran to arm itself with nuclear weapons,&quot; he said. &quot;Israel is not party to the agreement and will maintain full freedom to act.&quot;<br/><br/>But he also thanked Biden for his support of Israel. He promised to take a different approach than Netanyahu, who has alienated much of the Democratic Party through his antagonistic relationship with then-President Barack Obama and close ties with former President Donald Trump.<br/><br/>&quot;My government will make an effort to deepen and nurture relations with our friends in both parties -- bipartisan,&quot; Bennett said. &quot;If there are disputes, we will manage them with fundamental trust and mutual respect.&quot;<br/><br/>While Bennett&#39;s speech was conciliatory, Netanyahu&#39;s was confrontational. He boasted of his achievements, including diplomatic treaties with four Arab states and a successful coronavirus vaccination drive, before belittling the man who is replacing him.<br/><br/>He accused Bennett of abandoning Israel&#39;s right-wing electorate and joining weak &quot;leftists&quot; to become prime minister. He said Bennett did not have the backbone to stand up to Iran or pressure from the U.S. to make concessions to the Palestinians.<br/><br/>&quot;I will lead you in the daily struggle against this evil and dangerous leftist government in order to topple it,&quot; he said. &quot;God willing, it will happen a lot faster than what you think.&quot;<br/><br/>In the opposition, Netanyahu remains head of the largest party in parliament. The new coalition is a patchwork of small and midsize parties that could collapse if any of its members decide to bolt. Bennett&#39;s party, for instance, holds just six seats in the 120-seat parliament.<br/><br/>Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said the new government will likely be more stable than it appears. <br/><br/>Each party in the coalition will want to prove that it can deliver. For that, they need &quot;time and achievements,&quot; he said. Still, Netanyahu &quot;will continue to cast a shadow,&quot; Plesner said. <br/><br/>The driving force behind the coalition is Yair Lapid, a political centrist who will become prime minister in two years in a rotation agreement with Bennett, if the government lasts.<br/><br/>Lapid called off a planned speech, saying he was ashamed his 86-year-old mother had to witness the raucous behavior of his opponents.<br/><br/>&quot;I wanted her to be proud of the democratic process in Israel. Instead she, along with every citizen of Israel, is ashamed of you and remembers clearly why it&#39;s time to replace you,&quot; he said.<br/><br/>Netanyahu&#39;s place in Israeli history is secure, having served as prime minister for a total of 15 years — more than any other, including the country&#39;s founding father, David Ben-Gurion.<br/><br/>But his reputation as a political magician has faded -- particularly since he was indicted in 2019 for fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes. <br/><br/>He refused calls to step down, instead lashing out at the media, judiciary and law enforcement, going so far as to accuse his political opponents of orchestrating an attempted coup.

Article,Civil War Era Guestbooks Return Home To Bunker Hill After Mysterious Disappearance,Civil War Era Guestbooks Return Home To Bunker Hill After Mysterious Disappearance,"The sun was shining down on Charlestown Thursday as it commemorated Bunker Hill Day, the anniversary of the American Revolution’s Battle of Bunker Hill. This occasion was special for a two reasons. First, it was taking place in person after 15 months of the pandemic. And, second, three historic guestbooks dating back to the Civil War made their homecoming back to the Bunker Hill Monument.<br/><br/>In April, <a href=""https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/04/13/metro/surprise-bunker-hill-guestbooks-civil-war-emerge-auction/"" target=""_blank"">the Boston Globe reported</a> that a collection of Bunker Hill guestbooks, signed by Mary Todd Lincoln and other high profile Civil War figures, were being sold at an auction. As the Globe noted, this came as a surprise to Charlestown historians and the Bunker Hill Monument Association itself, which didn’t realize the artifacts were “no longer in its possession.”<br/><br/>Today, three of those guestbooks returned home, thanks to a “patriotic philanthropist” named David Rubenstein, an attorney and co-founder of The Carlyle Group, an investment group headquartered in Washington, D.C. Rubenstein bought the books at auction with the goal of donating them back to be displayed at the Bunker Hill Museum.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1623969048730,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-7563-d063-a1fd-7d7f62fc0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1623969048730,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-7563-d063-a1fd-7d7f62fc0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-1a88-d663-a3fa-9edb8cc10003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-1bd4-d663-a3fa-9fd7f5e80003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-1a14-d164-adfa-ba7fec460003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017a-1c18-d2d2-a1fe-deb9371e001f&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017a-1c18-d2d2-a1fe-deb9364f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>In a ceremony at the foot of the Bunker Hill Monument, Julie Hall, president of the Charlestown Historical Society, explained that the books, with their prominent signatures, were kept at the monument to keep a log of important guests.<br/><br/>“This monument was so important that people like presidents and senators and people of great importance would come and actually write their name — they were a part of history,” she said.<br/><br/>Seth Kaller, a historic document dealer from New York, facilitated Rubenstein’s purchase.

Daniel Ryan, who represents Charlestown in the State House. <br/><br/>“The founding fathers knew they didn’t have it right,” he said. “But they set the foundation so we could continue to build a more perfect union in which everybody is involved and everyone is represented.”<br/><br/>Boston City Councilor Lydia Edwards used the occasion to acknowledge another important holiday, celebrating Black freedom.<br/><br/>“If you’ve been in Charlestown for more than 5 minutes ever, you’ll hear the same saying: ‘There is no 4th of July without Bunker Hill Day, June 17th,’” Edwards said. “You’ll hear that over and over again. But I also want to say... not only is there no July 4th, there’s also no June 19th, which is Juneteenth, without Bunker Hill Day as well.” <br/><br/>Charlestown resident and military veteran Christiane Wolff was at the ceremony, and said she hopes the books’ homecoming will inspire students to learn more about American history. <br/><br/>“As a former teacher, I just don’t think they’re teaching enough in the schools… events like this — history becomes alive,” she said. “The little kids see it and it makes a really dramatic impression.”<br/>",Meghan Smith,Thu Jun 17 18:31:41 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The governor returned the bill (H 3827) with an amendment that would allow the full amount to be transferred to the trust fund, but would also appropriate more than half of it immediately.<br/><br/>If he had vetoed the bill, House and Senate leaders likely would have had the votes to override the governor. But with his spending plan, which gives Democrats a vehicle to begin advancing their own ARPA spending bill, the Republican governor has now given lawmakers something new to think about.<br/><br/>&quot;Folks in these communities are going to have a harder time getting back to work and a harder time getting back on their feet the longer we go thinking about how to spend this money,&quot; Baker said. &quot;And we chose areas that we that we believe the Legislature will be every bit as interested in spending resources on quickly as we are.&quot;<br/><br/>Overall, the governor proposed putting $1 billion toward housing, including $300 million earmarked to help first-time home buyers in communities of color disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.<br/>The amendment proposes another $200 million to support housing production through the CommonWealth Builder program, $200 million for rental housing production and $300 million for supportive senior and veteran housing.<br/><br/>The spending plan also includes hundreds of millions of dollars for job training, broadband internet infrastructure, addiction treatment and behavioral health, downtown development, tourism and nearly $1 billion for parks, culverts, dams, water and sewer infrastructure and other climate change resiliency projects.<br/><br/>&quot;This $2.8 billion plan will jump-start our recovery, and it keeps the focus where it needs to be on the families and communities that have been hardest hit by the virus, and by the pandemic,&quot; Baker said.<br/>Baker&#39;s return of the bill to the Legislature keeps the federal funding in limbo a month after Massachusetts received the lump sum aid through the American Rescue Plan Act.<br/><br/>Legislative leaders have not laid out a specific timetable for developing a spending plan of their own - House Speaker Ron Mariano previously mentioned decisions could come &quot;around June&quot; - but Baker said he was reticent to just start spending the relief money on his own with the House and Senate on record as wanting more control over how the funding gets spread around.<br/><br/>&quot;I think we&#39;re trying to pursue this in what I would describe as a good faith manner,&quot; Baker said.<br/><br/>House and Senate leaders did not immediately respond to requests for comment.<br/><br/>The governor has already released $109 million from the $5.3 billion in ARPA funding for Massachusetts to the cities of Chelsea, Everett, Methuen and Randolph who missed out on a chunk of federal aid due to quirks in the federal funding formula.<br/><br/>Earlier this week, he also said he intended to use ARPA funding to pay for a new vaccine Lottery.<br/><br/>The &quot;VaxMillions&quot; giveaway rolled out by Baker and Treasure Deb Goldberg is intended to encourage unvaccinated residents to get the shot and features 10 prizes totaling $6.5 million, including five $1 million prizes, and five scholarships of $300,000 each for entrants under 18.<br/><br/>The Massachusetts chapter of the National Federation of Independent Businesses said it was &quot;disappointed&quot; Baker did not propose to use any money to replenish the unemployment insurance trust fund.<br/>Baker recently partnered with lawmakers to relieve the sticker shock felt by businesses when they got their UI bills this spring by borrowing the money to recapitalize the depleted fund and allowing businesses to repay the money over 20 years.<br/><br/>Some states, however, have used chunks of their ARPA funding to rebuild their unemployment insurance trust funds and permanently reduce the debt burden on employers.<br/><br/>&quot;The state-mandated restrictions and overly generous state benefits helped fuel the current UI crisis, and now the state should help employers pay for it,&quot; said NFIB State Director Christopher Carlozzi.<br/>Other groups reacted warmly to the governor&#39;s plan.<br/><br/>Deb Markowitz, state director of The Nature Conservancy in Massachusetts, said the governor&#39;s proposed use of the federal funding would help by &quot;fostering healthy communities, providing clean water, addressing the impacts of climate change, and supporting our natural and working lands.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This type of bipartisan collaboration between our federal and state policymakers is essential for our nation to achieve a green recovery,&quot; Markowitz said.","Matt Murphy, State House News Service",Thu Jun 17 17:25:18 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Article,Worcester County Officials Trumpet Program To Stem Opioid Overdose Deaths,Worcester County Officials Trumpet Program To Stem Opioid Overdose Deaths,"More than half of people in Worcester County who were offered services following an opioid overdose accepted treatment as part of a program launched last year, according to data recently released by the Worcester County District Attorney’s office.<br/><br/>In March 2020, the DA’s office announced a partnership between the Critical Incident Management System (CIMS) and the police departments in Worcester County’s 60 cities and towns. Police departments use CIMS to collect overdose data and respond to non-fatal overdose victims with services and a follow-up visit from a plain clothes officer and a recovery specialist. Of those contacted for follow-up after a non-fatal overdose, 52 percent accepted services and another nine percent were already seeking services on their own.<br/><br/>“These are encouraging numbers,” District Attorney Joseph D. Early Jr. said in a press conference Tuesday. “It was a challenging year to launch this program with the roadblocks presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Any time we can help even one person get access to treatment is a life that is being saved. These people are our neighbors, our friends, our relatives.”<br/><br/>In Worcester, one of the communities participating in the program, City Manager Edward M. Augustus Jr. praised the work of the Worcester DA&#39;s office, and how CIMS has changed things.<br/><br/>“We have seen good success,” Augustus said at Tuesday&#39;s news conference. “Even though Massachusetts is seeing fatal overdoses go up, Worcester, I’m proud to say, between 2019-2020, saw a 7% decline in fatal overdoses in the city. It’s still too high. One death is too high, too many, but we are seeing some progress. We are seeing some movement in the right direction.”<br/><br/>Rev. Janice Ford, overseer of Opening the Word Peer Recovery Center in Webster, agreed that things are going in the right direction. She said reducing the number of fatal overdoses is the most helpful thing in getting people into recovery, and she praised emergency services in the region for increasingly carrying life-saving drugs like naloxone (Narcan).<br/><br/>“That has helped immensely to save people&#39;s lives, which, as I said, is the number one thing that we need to do. So that&#39;s why the emphasis is on that piece of it,” she said.<br/><br/>There were 960 overdoses in Worcester County where Narcan was administered last year. Of those instances, 96 percent of people survived. However, Ford said, addiction recovery goes beyond just reversing overdoses. <br/><br/>“When you want to deal with addiction recovery, you have to do it in a holistic fashion, body mind, spirit, emotion,” she said. “It&#39;s not just ‘Okay, let&#39;s give them, let&#39;s just put them on methadone and hope for the best,’ you know, it&#39;s way more than that. Way more than that. You&#39;re never cured of an addiction,” Ford added. “You can be in recovery, and that&#39;s why we use that term. A person is in recovery, but you&#39;re never cured.” <br/><br/>While the data from the past year of the CIMS program shows promising numbers in getting people to programs that can aid recovery, Ford stressed the importance of destigmatizing addiction and remembering there are people behind the percentages. <br/><br/>“I don&#39;t like it when people just think in terms of numbers. Like, I want people to think in terms of living breathing human beings. When you think about addiction recovery, you have to think about the people. I&#39;ve done funerals, of people that I had gotten to know and really care a lot about, and, you can&#39;t put a number to that,” she said.<br/><br/>While addiction remains stigmatized and opioid overdose deaths in Massachusetts continue to climb, the CIMS program continues to show promise in giving people struggling with substance abuse the opportunity to get treatment.

Article, Lifeguard Shortage Means Swim At Your Own Risk At Many Massachusetts Beaches And Ponds, Lifeguard Shortage Means Swim At Your Own Risk At Many Massachusetts Beaches And Ponds,"Patti Machado is worried. Usually by this time of year, Machado, Barnstable’s recreation director, has a full cadre of 105 lifeguards ready to patrol Cape Cod&#39;s beaches and ponds. But not this year. The town is facing a lifeguard shortage as the busy summer season gets underway.<br/><br/>“So, at the moment, we are 22 lifeguards short,” she said. <br/><br/>Other municipalities across the Commonwealth are facing the same situation with fewer lifeguards to watch over swimmers at public swim areas.<br/><br/>The Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation aims to hire approximately 600 lifeguards for agency-managed waterfront locations across the Commonwealth, including ocean and inland beaches, swimming pools, and wading pools. The DCR hasn’t filled all the spots yet.<br/><br/>Machado attributes the shortage to the pandemic and COVID- 19 restrictions that limited training classes.<br/><br/>“We&#39;ve not been able to run lifeguard training classes for a year, so you can&#39;t get lifeguards, if you can&#39;t get them trained,” she said.<br/><br/>Tim McGrath, Barnstable’s Aquatics Program Coordinator, said with the town missing one quarter of its lifeguard staff, they’ve had to cut lifeguard services at some swim locations.<br/><br/>&quot;We were planning on closing two of our smaller sites to our ponds to have enough lifeguards at our bigger sites,” McGrath said.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1624486496255,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000163-217a-d785-a373-2b7a8a1e0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1624486496255,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000163-217a-d785-a373-2b7a8a1e0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000164-cd8e-d15e-ad7d-efce37fc0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-377f-d887-adfb-77ff054b0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017a-3af0-d663-a3fa-bef30bcd001e&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017a-3af0-d663-a3fa-bef309980000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/><br/>State, city, and town officials have been advertising to hire more lifeguards.

But they have done outreach to remedy the shortage.<br/><br/>“We&#39;ve been conducting job fairs to attract as many young people as possible who might be interested in being lifeguards. Lifeguards get paid really well,” he said.<br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1624486396257,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000163-217a-d785-a373-2b7a8a1e0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1624486396257,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000163-217a-d785-a373-2b7a8a1e0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-3aea-dc5c-a77a-3aea58f30001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017a-3aea-dd7d-a57b-bfea4cf10000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017a-3aea-dd7d-a57b-bfea4cca0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">z3-wnCGQ.jpeg</bsp-image><br/><br/>A recent spate of drownings in Massachusetts has only heightened the urgency.<br/><br/>This spring two teens drowned in Brockton and a Worcester Police officer drowned attempting to rescue a boy at a local pond. The child also drowned.<br/><br/>Rebecca Thomas, director of Injury Prevention and Control at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, said the state already seeing an increase in reported drownings, though there is not yet data available for this year.<br/><br/>“I&#39;m pretty worried about this year,” said Thomas, noting there has been an increase in the number of 9-1-1 calls related to drowning. “The numbers do appear higher this year than they did last year. And last year, which was during the pandemic, was higher than the two years prior to that.”<br/><br/>For the 2021season, DCR continues to seek lifeguards in the Boston Region (including Cambridge and the surrounding towns), the North Region (specifically Saugus, Nahant, and East Boston), the South Region (specifically Sandwich and Westport), and the Central Region (Metro West to Worcester County). <br/><br/>“Every year, Massachusetts residents and visitors travel to DCR beaches, lakes, ponds, and pools seeking relief from the summer heat and time with friends and family outdoors,” said DCR Commissioner Jim Montgomery. “DCR lifeguards are absolutely critical to ensuring the public can safely enjoy our popular swimming locations and make a real difference by dedicating their summer days to safeguarding the public.&quot; <br/><br/>All DCR lifeguard applicants must be at least 16-years old and certified in lifeguard training, CPR, and First Aid. All applicants must be able to swim 500 yards in under 11 minutes. Ocean beach lifeguards are required to swim 500 yards in under 9 minutes and 30 seconds.<br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1624488087420,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000163-217a-d785-a373-2b7a8a1e0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1624488087420,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000163-217a-d785-a373-2b7a8a1e0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-3afe-dd7d-a57b-bffe54540001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017a-3afe-dc5c-a77a-3afe41d90000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017a-3afe-dc5c-a77a-3afe419b0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">thumbnail_IMG_5182.jpg</bsp-image><br/><br/>James Farrell of the United State Lifesaving Association is in charge of the New England region and oversees open water lifeguarding.

Article,'Difficulties Are Built Into The DNA': Jacob's Pillow Reopens After Pandemic And Fire,'Difficulties Are Built Into The DNA': Jacob's Pillow Reopens After Pandemic And Fire,"Jacob’s Pillow, the long-running dance festival in Becket, Massachusetts, has had a lot thrown at it this past year. The COVID-19 pandemic shut the venue down in 2020 for the first time in almost 90 years. Then last November, a fire gutted one of its dance theaters.<br/><br/>But if you look back through the Pillow’s history, it’s survived all kinds of challenges.<br/><br/>This summer, with the Ted Shawn Theatre under renovation and the loss of the Doris Duke Theatre to the fire, dance shows will be entirely outdoors<br/><br/>“We have almost a natural amphitheater,” said Jacob’s Pillow’s executive director, Pamela Tatge. “Audiences will be able to sit on benches and witness a performance with the backdrop of the Berkshire mountains.”<br/><br/>The Pillow, located on a couple hundred acres of land surrounded by mountains, is known worldwide as a sanctuary for dancers.<br/><br/><b>’The community-building power of dance’</b><br/><br/>This year’s nine-week season opens at the end of June with a world premiere from the <a href=""https://www.dorrancedance.com/"" target=""_blank"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(22, 141, 217); text-decoration: none; line-height: inherit; background: transparent;"">Dorrance Dance </a>company. Dancers and musicians developed the piece, inspired by the past year’s global experience of isolation, while living at the Pillow during a COVID-compliant bubble residency.<br/><br/>Later in the season Ballet Hispánico performs, and Ballet Coast to Coast will feature dancers from the Boston Ballet and Pacific Northwest Ballet.<br/><br/>There is dance planned off the mountain too, Tatge said, with a two-week series of pop-up street performances in Becket, Pittsfield, Great Barrington and North Adams.<br/><br/>“We just think people need to come out of their homes and experience the community-building power of dance,” Tatge said.<br/><br/>To understand how Jacob’s Pillow arrived at this moment in time is to understand how to go forward, Tatge said — especially after the last 15 months.<br/><br/>The November fire engulfed the Doris Duke Theatre, an important and well-loved structure at the Pillow. The Massachusetts State Fire Marshal couldn’t identify a specific cause, but determined the blaze was exacerbated by failed fire alarm and sprinkler systems.<br/><br/>“We took a few months to process what happened. We’re now in the process of picking an architect,” Tatge said.<br/><br/><b>&#39;Boy, have we been tested&#39;</b><br/><br/>“Difficulties are built into the DNA of Jacob’s Pillow in many ways,” said Norton Owen, the organization&#39;s archivist. “From the get-go we were really about making something happen out of nothing, and making something happen out of adversity,” Owen said.<br/><br/>Jacob’s Pillow was founded in the Great Depression. Within the first 10 years, Pearl Harbor and World War II took place. Men dancers went off to war, with gas and other material rations hitting just as the Pillow was starting to build up.<br/><br/>“And yet Jacob’s Pillow — alone among the Berkshire cultural organizations — continued throughout the war years,” said Owen, who has been at the Pillow for 45 years.<br/><br/>Owen said he well remembers the gas shortage of 1979, when people could fill their car only on certain days of the week. The town of Becket, for most of the audience, wasn’t exactly next door, Owen said.<br/><br/>The Pillow had one woe after another, he said, and at one point in the 1990s, it was at <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/25/arts/jacob-s-pillow-is-opening-but-a-trauma-lingers.html"" target=""_blank"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(22, 141, 217); text-decoration: none; line-height: inherit; background: transparent;"">risk of foreclosure</a>.<br/><br/>“I think our place is secure at this point, but boy, have we been tested,” Owen said.<br/><br/>Recently tested with the pandemic, when 40% of the staff had to be laid off. Only some have been rehired.<br/><br/>As for <a href=""https://danceinteractive.jacobspillow.org/?_ga=2.176102114.1136340873.1623704907-589541307.1621879834"" target=""_blank"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(22, 141, 217); text-decoration: none; line-height: inherit; background: transparent;"">documenting </a>all of it, the Pillow has been recording dance performances and epic moments on film and video since its very beginnings. Owen said this past year’s online work is now a part of that.<br/><br/>One of Owen’s favorite sounds of Jacob’s Pillow captured on tape is the notes of a piano being played in a studio during a class.<br/><br/>“You could hear it all around because the doors were open,” Owen remembered.<br/><br/>The history of dance and of Jacob’s Pillow in many ways is embedded in a dancer’s body Owen said. A dancer moves in a way that’s reminiscent of their teacher, who learned to dance from someone else, and so on.<br/><br/>Owen said that may be one of the reasons the Pillow is so resilient.<br/>",Jill Kaufman,Thu Jul 01 06:00:49 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Article,Bill Cosby’s Sex Assault Conviction Overturned By Court,Bill Cosby’s Sex Assault Conviction Overturned By Court,"Pennsylvania’s highest court threw out Bill Cosby’s sexual assault conviction and opened the way for his immediate release from prison Wednesday in a stunning reversal of fortune for the comedian once known as “America’s Dad,” ruling that the prosecutor who brought the case was bound by his predecessor&#39;s agreement not to charge Cosby.<br/><br/>Cosby, 83, has served more than two years of a three- to 10-year sentence after being found guilty of drugging and violating Temple University sports administrator Andrea Constand at his suburban Philadelphia home in 2004. He was the first celebrity tried and convicted in the #MeToo era.<br/><br/>The former “Cosby Show” star was arrested in 2015, when a district attorney armed with newly unsealed evidence — the comic&#39;s damaging deposition testimony in a lawsuit brought by Constand — brought charges against him days before the 12-year statute of limitations ran out.<br/><br/>But the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said that District Attorney Kevin Steele, who made the decision to arrest Cosby, was obligated to stand by his predecessor’s promise not to charge Cosby. There was no evidence that promise was ever put in writing.<br/><br/>Justice David Wecht, writing for a split court, said Cosby had relied on the former district attorney&#39;s decision not to charge him when the comedian gave his potentially incriminating testimony in the Constand’s civil case.<br/><br/>The court called Cosby&#39;s arrest “an affront to fundamental fairness, particularly when it results in a criminal prosecution that was forgone for more than a decade.”<br/><br/>The justices said that overturning the conviction, and barring any further prosecution, “is the only remedy that comports with society’s reasonable expectations of its elected prosecutors and our criminal justice system.”<br/><br/>A Cosby spokesman did not immediately return a message seeking comment. Nor did a Steele representative, Constand or her lawyer.<br/><br/>&quot;FINALLY!!!! A terrible wrong is being righted — a miscarriage of justice is corrected!&#39; the actor’s “Cosby Show” co-star Phylicia Rashad tweeted.<br/><br/>“I am furious to hear this news,” actor Amber Tamblyn, a founder of Time’s Up, an advocacy group for victims of sexual assault, said in a Twitter post. “I personally know women who this man drugged and raped while unconscious. Shame on the court and this decision.”<br/><br/>Four judges formed the majority that ruled in Cosby&#39;s favor, while three others dissented in whole or in part.<br/><br/>Even though Cosby was charged only with the assault on Constand, the trial judge allowed five other accusers to testify that they, too, were similarly victimized by Cosby in the 1980s. Prosecutors called them as witnesses to establish what they said was a pattern of criminal behavior on Cosby&#39;s part.<br/><br/>The Pennsylvania Supreme Court justices voiced concern about what they saw as the judiciary’s increasing tendency to allow testimony that crosses the line into character attacks. State law allows “prior bad acts” testimony only in limited cases, including to show a crime pattern so specific it serves to identify the perpetrator.<br/><br/>But the court declined to say whether five other accusers should have been allowed to testify, considering it moot given the finding that Cosby should not have been prosecuted in the first place.<br/><br/>In New York, the judge presiding over last year’s trial of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, whose case had sparked the explosion of the #MeToo movement in 2017, let four other accusers testify. Weinstein was convicted and sentenced to 23 years in prison. He is now facing separate charges in California.<br/><br/>In May, Cosby was denied paroled after refusing to participate in sex offender programs behind bars. He has long said he would resist the treatment programs and refuse to acknowledge wrongdoing even if it means serving the full 10-year sentence.<br/><br/>Prosecutors said Cosby repeatedly used his fame and “family man” persona to manipulate young women, holding himself out as a mentor before betraying them.<br/><br/>Cosby, a groundbreaking Black actor who grew up in public housing in Philadelphia, made a fortune estimated at $400 million during his 50 years in the entertainment industry. His trademark clean comedy fueled popular TV shows, books and standup acts.<br/><br/>He fell from favor in his later years as he lectured the Black community about family values, but was attempting a comeback when he was arrested.<br/><br/>The AP does not typically identify sexual assault victims without their permission, which Constand has granted.<br/>",Maryclaire Dale | AP,Wed Jun 30 14:08:03 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The transcript below has been edited for clarity. </i><br/><br/><b>Henry Santoro: </b>This book is getting rave reviews across all platforms.<b> </b>Let me start by saying this. I can relate. My mom was raised in and out of foster homes pretty much right up until the time she met the man that would become my father. And then my parents, my sister and I were foster parents all through my childhood but always losing kids that were brought to us. And sometimes we got really attached to these kids. “Stranger Care” tells us that we can, in fact, love something or someone that is not ours. And when you realized that you sat down, and you wrote a love letter to Coco. That letter is this book.

I wanted “Stranger Care” to be exactly what you say, a love letter to Coco. I wanted to write a book that might mother her when I was no longer allowed to. One of the things that kept returning to me as I worked on this book was this idea that we are all made of the same material. We all come from the stars. And so, if that’s true — if whale, rock, child, river are all made of the same material — then wherever we find ourselves, we are never far from home. I wanted to help make a world where strangers would be better tended so that, wherever Coco landed, she might be well cared for. <br/><br/><b>Santoro: </b>Where did the title come from? <br/><br/><b>Sentilles: </b>“Stranger Care” is the name that we were called as foster parents. My husband Eric and I were technically known “non-relative care providers,” or “stranger care.” And so, I wanted to think about that word, which is quite an alienating term for such an intimate task — to take care of someone else’s child that might become someday your child. And I never could quite escape the stranger-ness of my identity as a foster parent, even though the foster care system asks you to expand your sense of family to welcome children that you’re not biologically related to into your home. The system itself really champions biology, although we know that biology guarantees nothing, which is why the foster care system exists in part. But I also then started thinking about the word “stranger care” and looking to the natural world for evidence of strangers caring for one another. So I started thinking about the ways trees care for each other, whether they’re of the same species or not, or the way the moon relates to the ocean, or the way the robins outside my office window tended their young. So, I started looking to nature for examples of family in a more expansive and world-repairing way. <br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1625167885460,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1625167885460,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-638d-dc5c-a77a-6bcf440a0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017a-6362-d2d2-a1fe-f3ebcaab0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017a-6362-d2d2-a1fe-f3ebca700000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">sarah sentilles eric coco foster</bsp-image><br/><b>Santoro: </b>But you also learned a tremendous amount about motherhood that a traditional mothering experience would not have taught you. <br/><br/><b>Sentilles:</b> That’s true.

Police later said they were refueling.<br/><br/>The trooper called for backup and most of the group went into the nearby woods until they surrendered to a police tactical team just after 10 a.m. The standoff closed Interstate 95 in the area during the busy holiday weekend and some area residents were told to shelter in place.<br/><br/>The group told police they traveling from Rhode Island to Maine to conduct “training.”<br/><br/>None of the men, who were dressed in military fatigues and body armor and were armed with long guns and pistols, had a license to carry firearms in Massachusetts.<br/><br/>During the standoff one member of the group broadcast on a social media account of the group “Rise of the Moors” that they were not antigovernment or anti-police.<br/><br/>The website for the group says they are “Moorish Americans dedicated to educating new Moors and influencing our Elders.”<br/><br/>The Southern Poverty Law Center says the Moorish sovereign citizen movement is a collection of independent organizations and individuals that emerged in the 1990s as an offshoot of the antigovernment sovereign citizens&#39; movement. People in the movement believe individual citizens hold sovereignty over, and are independent of, the authority of federal and state governments.<br/><br/>Mark Pitcavage, a senior research fellow for the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, said the sovereign citizen movement is rarely involved in paramilitary activity.<br/><br/>“This particular group, Rise of the Moors, is actually interested in that so that makes them unusual for groups within this movement,” Pitcavage said.<br/><br/>A number of the pioneers of the sovereign citizen movement in the 1970s were white supremacists. The vast majority of Moorish sovereign citizens are African American, Pitcavage said.<br/><br/>“I find it very ironic... that the Moorish sovereign citizen movement is so large and active, they actually repeat many theories that were actually cooked up, again many years ago, by white supremacists,” he said.<br/><br/>Police said the adults arrested Saturday are from Rhode Island, New York and Michigan. They will be each be held at the Billerica House of Correction on $100,000 cash bail. They are due in court later this week.<br/><br/>It could not immediately be determined if the suspects have lawyers.",Associated Press,Mon Jul 05 13:50:01 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In his landmark federal trial, he successfully argued for the recognition of Native Americans as persons entitled to rights and protection under law.<br/><br/>“That hand is not the color of yours. But if you pierce it, I shall feel pain,&quot; Standing Bear famously said in court. &quot;The blood that will flow from mine will be the same color as yours. I am a man. The same God made us both.”<br/><br/>There’s no firm timeline for the tomahawk&#39;s homecoming, but Wright and other Ponca tribe leaders are slated to travel to Harvard in September, according to Jane Pickering, the museum&#39;s director.<br/><br/>The tribe delegation will view the tomahawk as well as other items related to Standing Bear, including a beaded necklace, quilled moccasins and a pipe bowl, she said.<br/><br/>In the meantime, Wright said the Nebraska tribe is preparing its own museum, which is located near Standing Bear’s grave, to properly display the artifacts.<br/><br/>He also credited Brett Chapman, an Oklahoma lawyer and descendant of Standing Bear, for his <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/ma-state-wire-harvard-university-massachusetts-native-americans-178f8469a678b2c15e8e89ed7166c5f4"" target=""_blank"">efforts to raise awareness</a> about the tomahawk and the importance of returning it.<br/><br/>“This heritage item belonged to the Ponca people then, it belongs to us now and after this, it will belong to us forever,” Chapman said Monday.<br/><br/>The tomahawk has changed hands several times over the decades.<br/><br/>Standing Bear, who died in 1908, originally bestowed the tomahawk to John Lee Webster, one of his lawyers in his landmark case, but the heirloom was sold to a private collector when Webster died, according to Chapman.<br/><br/>Harvard acquired it in 1982 when it was donated by the estate of William Henry Claflin Jr., a Belmont, Massachusetts, resident who had purchased it from the widow of William Morris, an Omaha attorney, in 1930, according to the museum. It&#39;s unclear how Morris came into possession of the tomahawk.<br/><br/>Debate over the tomahawk comes as Harvard has <a href=""https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2021/3/12/nagpra-peabody-letter/"" target=""_blank"">faced criticism</a> over its repatriation efforts.<br/><br/>The Association on American Indian Affairs said in February that the university does not always consult with tribes about cultural items that could be returned to them, in violation of federal law.<br/><br/>It also comes as Standing Bear is enjoying a revival of sorts.<br/><br/>A bronze statue of his likeness clutching his tomahawk was installed at the U.S. Capitol&#39;s National Statuary Hall in 2019. Similar statues have also been recently raised in Lincoln, Nebraska&#39;s capital, as well as the Ponca Tribe’s headquarters in Niobrara.",Philip Marcelo | Associated Press,Tue Jul 06 13:33:36 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s tragic that he died, but it&#39;s kind of like he asked for it at the same time.”<br/><br/>A squad of gunmen assassinated Haitian President Jovenel Moïse and wounded his wife in an overnight raid on their home, inflicting more chaos on a country that was already enduring gang violence, soaring inflation and protests of his increasingly authoritarian rule.<br/><br/>Bonheur of Mattapan is a second generation Haitian-American who has never set foot in Haiti but closely monitors events there. He says he hopes one day to visit the nation of his parents&#39; birth but fears instability will only increase in the weeks and months following the assassination. <br/><br/>Moïse was &quot;very arrogant. He doesn&#39;t do nothing, and he has a lot of gangs in the country,” said Kate, another bakery customer, who would not give her last name. “They&#39;re killing — pregnant women get killed, priests get killed, elderly get killed, civilians get killed. Every single one get killed. He never said a word. We&#39;ve been complaining all the time. Every time that people take the streets to demand better living condition, he hired mercenaries to kill them. So now, karma.”<br/><br/>Others expressed sympathy for the president and his wife — who was injured in the attack — and said the assassination was an attack on democracy itself.  <br/><br/>Moïse&#39;s wife, Martine, was in stable but critical condition and was being moved to Miami for treatment, according to the Haitian ambassador to the United States. <br/><br/>For many local immigrants, the upheaval stirred fears for loved ones still in Haiti. Jean Jeune, a liaison for the Haitian community in Cambridge, said his phone rang continuously all morning. &quot;We are devastated,&quot; he told GBH News. &quot;Everybody here is panicking ... and they want to know what&#39;s going on and what we are going to do.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;There is a huge void right now,&quot; said Pierre Noel, the executive director of the Haiti Development Institute at the Boston Foundation. &quot;You no longer have a president, and you also do not have a parliament.&quot; The chief justice of the Haitian Supreme Court recently died of COVID-19, Noel said, so &quot;this makes for a very confusing situation right now, politically.” <br/><br/>Noel said it is impossible to know what the next few weeks may bring, but Haiti&#39;s history of instability does not bode well. <br/><br/>Haiti already appeared to be heading for volatility ahead of general elections later this year. Moïse had been ruling by decree for more than a year after failing to hold elections, and the opposition demanded he step down in recent months, saying he was leading the country toward yet another grim period of authoritarianism.<br/><br/>“[This is a] very sad and hard blow for the Haitian people and our experience with democracy,&quot; Noel said. &quot;There&#39;s an opportunity now, though — and I say opportunity because I&#39;m an optimist ... We have to look at good leadership, strong institutions — and strong and efficient institutions.&quot;<br/><br/>Haitian community leaders plan to meet later this week in the Boston area to discuss the volatile situation in the island nation, though details are still being worked out.<br/><br/><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report. </i>",Phillip Martin,Wed Jul 07 22:01:37 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But, for now, those drugs are illegal and can’t be prescribed.<br/><br/>Efforts across the country to decriminalize psychedelics are gaining steam in some places, including western Massachusetts, but some people want to slow down the process.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1625777975433,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1625777975433,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000178-6b9e-dbea-a578-ffde36470003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000177-ced7-ddf9-af77-cfdf888f0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017a-87ea-dd7d-a57b-87ea612c002c&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017a-87ea-dd7d-a57b-87ea61010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/><br/>Those of a certain age will remember psychedelic drugs were a mainstay of the 1960s counterculture — the part that focused on exploration of the soul.<br/><br/>Thousands of young people followed the call of eccentric Harvard professor Timothy Leary – a Springfield, Massachusetts, native – who became famous for his anthem: “Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out.”<br/><br/>But amid the spiritual expansion, there were many out-of-control acid trips, some people jumped off buildings, and others reported flashbacks and long-term cognitive effects.<br/><br/>By the late 1960s, most hallucinogens were banned. The Nixon administration shut down research into psychedelics as mental health treatment and moved them into the Schedule 1 category of illegal drugs, the same as heroin.<br/><br/>As a result, psychiatrists like Tom Insel think many people lost out on an effective way to reduce their suffering.<br/><br/>Psychedelics work less like a medication, he said, and more like a portal to better insight. <br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1625778035348,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1625778035348,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;migration.alignment&quot;:&quot;RIGHT&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-87eb-d663-a3fa-8ffb56510001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017a-87eb-d663-a3fa-8ffb47470000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:&quot;/enhancement/EnhancementRight.hbs&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017a-87eb-d663-a3fa-8ffb47340000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">Bill Dwight.jpg</bsp-image><br/><br/>“When you talk to people in the field, pretty quickly they talk about the experience of taking the drug,” he said, “and the way in which that experience leads to behavioral, cognitive, affective change.”<br/><br/>Insel is former director of the National Institute for Mental Health. Now he’s an advisor and investor in Compass, a company seeking to develop psychedelic-assisted mental health treatment. <br/><br/>“It&#39;s almost as if what the drug is trying to do is to get you to where you get in five years of psychotherapy,” Insel said, “but to do that in five weeks through a very structured set of experiences.”<br/><br/>The FDA has recently approved some clinical trials involving psychedelics, including for Compass. Insel said scientists still aren’t sure of the exact biological mechanisms for psychedelics, though two recent studies show they can reduce symptoms of depression and PTSD.<br/><br/>Psychedelics are often described as dissolving the ego — obliterating the division between oneself and the world. <br/><br/>“You&#39;re just delighted with yourself, you&#39;re just in sort of rapture. There&#39;s a total joy and then mix that with a total loss of fear,” said Emily Howard, a psychotherapist in Amherst, Massachusetts. “So it means all of your usual defenses, all the little tiny, subtle ones that guard your heart are just gone.”<br/><br/>Howard first experimented with hallucinogens in college in the 1990s. More recently, she’s tried MDMA (also called ecstasy) and psilocybin – mostly, she said, for professional reasons. She works with patients who use psychedelics to help treat depression, anxiety, PTSD and other problems they could not resolve in more traditional ways. <br/><br/>But since most psychedelic drugs are illegal even for medical reasons, Howard has to be careful how she incorporates them into her practice. <br/><br/>“I knew I didn&#39;t want to be in jail, because I&#39;m a mother,” Howard said, “I was like, ‘I&#39;ve got to figure out a way to do this legally.’” <br/><br/>She tells clients she can’t help them find the drugs or even the psychedelic “guides” who stay with people for the hours they’re hallucinating. As she states in her public profile, she will only work to prepare clients for their drug experience, or help them make sense of it afterwards.<br/><br/>“What did you listen to? What was hard about it? What were the themes, what are you literally going to do differently in your life to integrate this?” she said. <br/><br/>To protect her license, Howard doesn’t accept health insurance for psychedelic therapy. But she said this work would be a lot easier if psychedelics were legal. She’d feel more secure about the quality of the drugs and it wouldn’t be so hard for therapists and guides to find each other.<br/><br/>“We could actually create more of a professional network and support each other,” she said.<br/><br/>Last November, Oregon passed a ballot measure to legalize psilocybin. Across the country, cities and towns are moving in a similar direction.<br/><br/>In April, Northampton, Massachusetts, passed a resolution in April – one of three in Massachusetts, along with Cambridge and Somerville – calling on the local police to deprioritize psychedelics as a reason for arrest. <br/><br/>“We&#39;ve devoted our energies to demonizing people who are affiliated or associated with drugs in any way, at our own peril,” said Northampton City Councilor Bill Dwight, who co-sponsored the resolution.<br/><br/>Decades ago, in his 20s, Dwight used hallucinogens himself.<br/><br/>“I consumed everything at some point,” he said. “LSD, psilocybin, peyote, MDMA, DMT.”<br/><br/>While Dwight never found them particularly transformative, he knows many others have, which is why he wanted to make them more accessible, especially as mental health treatment. Granted, the Northampton resolution is mostly symbolic, and Dwight said there’s been little local pushback.<br/><br/>“It doesn&#39;t particularly impact what we&#39;re doing here,” said Northampton’s police chief, Jody Kasper. <br/><br/>Kasper said the police rarely arrest anyone for simple drug possession anyway, and even less often for psychedelics.<br/><br/>“I understand there&#39;s large national issues that the council may want to weigh in on,” Kasper said, “and I think they&#39;re more making a statement to our local community and the broader community about what they believe should be the priorities of our systems.”<br/><br/>Even if the police aren’t speaking out against legalization, some people one might not expect are – including Insel, the psychiatrist who considers psychedelics a promising treatment.<br/><br/>“There&#39;s a risk here if the drugs are used by the wrong people, at the wrong time, in the wrong way,” he said.<br/><br/>Insel thinks psychedelics should stay out of the public domain until there’s more medical research into their effectiveness, which is the argument made by some companies developing psychedelics for market.<br/><br/>Insel worries that — like in the 1960s — too many people would use them irresponsibly, leading to injuries and deaths. And if that happens, the government could again shut down research.<br/><br/>“Because the FDA will be spooked, as will the public, in the same way that happened in 1972 or 1970,” Insel said. “We&#39;ve been there before. That&#39;s exactly how this went off the rails.”<br/><br/>Proponents of legalization, however, consider those worries unfounded.<br/><br/>For one, they say the legalization of marijuana in Massachusetts and elsewhere did not cause the sky to fall. And many people already use psychedelics, just where the authorities can’t see them. They’d rather the options be aboveboard — for recreation and for mental healthcare.<br/><br/><i>This article was <a href=""https://www.nepm.org/post/mass-communities-move-toward-decriminalizing-psychedelics-some-pushback#stream/0"" target=""_blank"">reported by</a> New England Public Media. </i>",Karen Brown | NEPM,Fri Jul 09 07:00:34 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some like Chavez are looking to find sex buyers to survive. But an investigation by the the GBH News Center for Investigative Reporting finds that too often the adult men they meet are dangerous and the encounters can lead to sexual exploitation, assault and trafficking.<br/><br/>“It creates an easy place for sexual predators to look for these kids,” said Jack Turban, a fellow in child and adolescent psychiatry at Stanford University School of Medicine. “Grindr is also at fault for knowing that this is happening and not doing anything about it.”<br/><br/>Since 2015, more than 100 men across the United States — including police officers, priests and teachers — have faced charges related to sexually assaulting minors or attempting sexual activity with youth they met on Grindr, according to a GBH News search of public records. <br/><br/>Among them, a Lawrence <a href=""https://www.eagletribune.com/news/merrimack_valley/cop-charged-with-rape-of-boy-wants-off-house-arrest/article_574fea10-5305-549e-8ae9-8773d5a5a1c1.html"" target=""_blank"">police officer</a> is currently facing charges in Essex County Superior Court for allegedly raping a 13-year-old he met on the app in 2018. The officer pleaded not guilty, and the next hearing is scheduled for August. He declined to comment for this story. <br/><br/>In 2019, a former Newburyport City Council president was <a href=""https://www.newburyportnews.com/news/local_news/former-newburyport-official-admits-to-child-rape/article_a9fe43e4-565b-5301-86c4-a1535c14e1ee.html"" target=""_blank"">sentenced</a> to 2 ½ years in state prison after pleading guilty to raping a 15-year-old he met on Grindr. And in 2017, a Colorado <a href=""https://www.kktv.com/content/news/Man-sentenced-to-50-years-for-sexual-servitude-and-human-trafficking-421819164.html"" target=""_blank"">man</a> was sentenced to 50 years in prison for luring underage boys he met on Grindr into sexual servitude.<br/><br/>The app also has become a rich hunting ground for law enforcement and self-described activists modeled after the former NBC program, “To Catch a Predator.” Groups across the country are looking to shame adult men seeking sex with children and, in some cases, turning them over to the police. They pose as underage boys and then film their interactions with men who come to meet them.<br/><br/>A Northborough man appears to have fallen into this trap last year. He is facing charges in Fitchburg District Court for allegedly attempting to meet a 15-year-old boy on Grindr, who turned out to be a decoy. He pleaded not guilty, and a jury trial is scheduled for October. He couldn’t be reached for comment.<br/><br/>But for sexual predators, Grindr provides a space to find many real underage boys. More than half of sexually active gay and bisexual boys between the ages of 14 and 17 find sexual partners on Grindr and other similar apps, according to a 2018 <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20792600-macapagal-et-al-2018-hookup-app-use-in-amsm-jah#document/p1/a2039470"" target=""_blank"">study</a> by Northwestern University researchers.

The number of reports of adults seeking children online for sex nearly doubled to 38,000 last year from the year before, according to the <a href=""https://www.missingkids.org/theissues/onlineenticement"" target=""_blank"">National Center for Missing and Exploited Children</a>. About 13 percent of the alleged victims were boys. But an ongoing GBH <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/unseen-the-boy-victims-of-the-sex-trade-pt-1"" target=""_blank"">investigation</a> has found that the number of male victims is vastly under-reported — partly because boys don’t disclose what happened, stifled by fear, shame and stigma, and partly because society often has trouble seeing them as victims at all. <br/><br/>Turban recently co-published an <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20792598-suto-et-al-2020-gsn-app-use-in-sexual-minority-teens"" target=""_blank"">article</a> in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry estimating that about one quarter of all gay and bisexual adolescent males are using Grindr and similar apps — likely hundreds of thousands of youth nationwide. <br/><br/>He’s seen gay teens end up at an emergency room in Boston — where he worked until last year — in crisis after being sexually exploited by men they met on Grindr yet too ashamed to seek help from other adults. <br/><br/>He says he has received some pushback from members of the gay community about his <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/13/opinion/grindr-gay-teenagers-sex-apps.html"" target=""_blank"">focus</a> on Grindr, when there are so many sites targeting children. There’s a history of anti-gay propaganda painting gay men as pedophiles, he said, when there is no research to show they are more likely to be predators than others. <br/><br/>But Turban says homophobia is also to blame for why LGBTQ youth have so few outlets to find intimacy and also why their victimization is so seldom talked about. He says clinicians and family members should do more to talk to gay youth about the health and safety risks of dating apps. And he says Grindr and other apps should do more to restrict their access. <br/><br/>“Because we haven’t created developmentally appropriate safe spaces, these kids have been forced online onto these spaces that aren’t safe for them,” he said.<br/><h4>“The wild west of the gay world”</h4>Grindr was created in 2009 by Israeli-born, Tufts University graduate Joel Simkhai. He sold a controlling share of the company in 2016 to a Chinese company for a <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-12/china-tech-billionaire-buys-control-of-us-gay-dating-app-grindr"" target=""_blank"">reported</a> $93 million and eventually relinquished full <a href=""https://grindr.tumblr.com/post/161183176178/whats-up-with-grindr"" target=""_blank"">ownership</a>. Last year, the company was purchased by a U.S.-based company for more than <a href=""https://www.advocate.com/business/2020/6/15/grindrs-new-owners-want-create-positive-place-everyone"" target=""_blank"">$600 million</a>.<br/><br/>Grindr claims on its website that <a href=""https://www.grindr.com/about/"" target=""_blank"">millions</a> of users flock to the site every day — using its location-based technology to help people connect to others close to them. <br/><br/>Bradley Tyrrell, 35, of Newton says the app is a “double-edged sword” — a place to meet gay men but also with many unknowns. Tyrrell said he met his boyfriend on the Grindr but also has been “catfished,” meaning recruited by men lying about their identity. Offers from prostitutes are common, he said, and he believes minors should stay away. “It’s the wild west of the gay world.” <br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1626051810531,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1626051810531,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-97fd-d2d2-a1fe-d7fd76bd0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;Bradley Tyrrell, 35, poses for a photo in Brighton, Mass., on July 11, 2021.&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017a-97fd-d2d2-a1fe-d7fd64c20000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017a-97fd-d2d2-a1fe-d7fd64920000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">DSC_0315.jpg</bsp-image><br/><br/>Kathryn Macapagal, a research professor at Northwestern University, says she first asked teens about hook-up apps in 2016 when she was preparing a sex education program for gay and bisexual boys. <br/><br/>She was surprised by the answers. The majority of sexually active teens said they had met people through apps and most of them had sexual encounters with their on-line hookups; only about a quarter of those who had sex said they used condoms. <br/><br/>Her team conducted more surveys to talk about why they get on the apps — often gay and questioning teens looking for community in a world that doesn’t welcome them. <br/><br/>Teens also told her why they would stop. “There were so many teens that use that exact same phrase, ‘creepy older guys who just wanted to have sex,’” she said.<br/><h4>“Darkest secrets”</h4>German Chavez is 6-foot-2 with a wide smile, a round face and a joyous laugh.<br/><br/>He identifies as non-binary, sometimes male and sometimes female, and is open to being addressed by all gender pronouns.

He was living in Florida with his siblings and his single mother. The first man he met was 60 years old. Instead of connection, he said, the man groped him at a diner and brought him to his home to sexually assault him. <br/><br/>He said Grindr hook-ups gave him the false impression being gay was all about sex. <br/><br/>“Just because I was introduced to this one guy who probably isn’t gay and just is a pedophile, like, it doesn’t mean that that’s how the community is,” he said. “That’s the scary part about Grindr, that it can be, like, literally a guy who doesn’t identify as gay and just likes kids.”<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1631020624368,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-7563-d063-a1fd-7d7f62fc0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1631020624368,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-7563-d063-a1fd-7d7f62fc0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;quote&quot;:&quot;&amp;quot;That’s the scary part about Grindr, that it can be, like, literally a guy who doesn’t identify as gay and just likes kids.&amp;quot;&quot;,&quot;attribution&quot;:&quot;German Chavez&quot;,&quot;fallbackToPerson&quot;:false,&quot;useGrayBackground&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017b-c067-d6e2-ab7b-f96733d70011&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000162-022d-dc51-ab7b-96bf02e20008&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017b-c067-d6e2-ab7b-f96732f60000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/><br/>A year later, Chavez says he started selling sex on Grindr to help his financially struggling family; his activity increased a few years later after he ran away to New York City and was on his own. He met men who assaulted him, beat him and fleeced him, he said.<br/><br/>Asked why he never sought help, Chavez grew emotional.<br/><br/>“You kind of feel like because you’re raising yourself, it’s your fault. So you don’t want to talk about it,” he said, trying to keep back tears. “When you think about it, it’s like, ‘no, you’re a kid, you are supposed to be in high school playing or your parents are supposed to be taking care of you.’”<br/><br/>Chavez said he was able to stop selling sex after he discovered drag, giving him confidence and another way to make money. Chavez still has Grindr on his phone, using the location-based technology to identify men he has met at a club before they get too far out of range. Sometimes underage boys reach out to him, he says, recognizing his role as Lady German, and he cautions them to delete the app.<br/><br/>Chavez says it’s important to talk about the problems he has faced in order to protect others.<br/><br/>“The gay community can be the most colorful place in the world,” he said. “But it has the darkest secrets and darkest places ever because there are these things like this that are not talked about.”<br/><h4>Online, nobody checks IDs</h4><br/>Grindr says in its terms of service that it restricts users to 18 and older but cautions it makes no effort to verify identities. <br/><br/>Part of the reason Grindr can say this is because it is protected by federal law. The 1996 law, known as <a href=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230"" target=""_blank"">Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act</a>, shields companies from legal liability for content created by others. <br/><br/>Supporters like the Electronic Frontier Foundation <a href=""https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230"" target=""_blank"">say</a> the law is “one of the most valuable tools for protecting freedom of information on the Internet.” Without it, advocates say, companies like Facebook, Amazon and Yelp would not be able to function, because they would be required to vet every review, article or comment published on their sites. <br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1643206102247,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1643206102247,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;Read More Of Unseen&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000178-a70d-dfa6-adff-bffdda5b0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a66000a&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000178-ea70-dfa6-adff-fbf87a200001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a66000a&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-87e8-dd7d-a57b-87e8b0eb0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-4733-d44d-a57c-67ff48ef0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a110002&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-a145-d9b9-a7fd-eb57c56a0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-c8ca-deb6-a3fd-ebcfb4db0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017a-9805-d663-a3fa-9c5788210022&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017a-9805-d663-a3fa-9c5787f40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>The law protected Grindr in 2015 when a New Jersey man sued the company after he was charged with sexually assaulting a 13-year-old boy whom he met, via a third person, on the app.<br/><br/>The man claimed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey that he didn’t know the boy was underage because the app restricts users to 18 and up. A federal court judge dismissed the case, citing Section 230’s “Good Samaritan” clause, which protects Internet providers from being “treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.”<br/><br/>But a growing number of advocates and public officials are calling for <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-democrat-tech/top-democrat-speaks-to-biden-staff-about-key-internet-law-idUSKBN2BE2EG"" target=""_blank"">reforms</a> to Section 230 to hold companies more accountable for dangers, including their role in sex trafficking.<br/><br/>Texas attorney Annie McAdams is hoping she can change the way judges look at the law. She’s filed three suits in Texas state courts against Facebook, arguing that the company is not just a publisher but that it’s “participating and facilitating” in the sex trafficking of children. <br/><br/>Facebook asked the Texas Supreme Court to dismiss the cases, citing Section 230. In late June, the state’s top court <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20972778-facebookdecision"" target=""_blank"">ruled</a> in McAdams’ favor, stating that the law protects companies for actions of their users. But “holding internet platforms accountable for their own misdeeds is quite another thing. This is particularly the case for human trafficking.”<br/><br/>The court sent the cases back to district court to allow the plaintiffs to try to prove their allegations of wrongdoing. Facebook officials said last week that they are “reviewing the decision” to decide about any next steps. “Sex trafficking is abhorrent and not allowed on Facebook,” a company spokesman said. “We will continue our fight against the spread of this content and the predators who engage in it.” <br/><br/>McAdams says she has amassed a group of clients to file more suits if she doesn’t succeed with these cases. Most of her clients are female, she says, but she knows there are more boy victims who haven’t reached out to her. She’s aware of safety concerns on Grindr and expects someday she will also sue the mobile app under the same legal construct.<br/><br/>“When you’re dealing with the vulnerabilities of somebody who’s gay and who&#39;s developing in our society, it’s tenfold more difficult and more impressionable,’’ she said. “Grindr holds a very, very, very high responsibility to these children.”<br/><br/>Cheyenne Ehrlich, owner of a company called SaferKid that works to protect children from dangers on the Internet, says lawmakers either have to amend Section 230 or require companies to impose age verification. Ehrlich has Grindr on his <a href=""https://www.saferkid.com/app-reviews-for-parents/grindr-gay-same-sex-bi-social-network-to-chat-and-meet-guys"" target=""_blank"">top list</a> of most dangerous apps for children because of its adult content. <br/><br/>“If everybody in the line of fire — the management, the shareholders — all had liability for every instance of child sexual assault that occurred on one of these apps,” abuse would stop, he said. About Grindr, he warns: “No one under age 18 should use this app.”<br/><br/>Haley McNamara, vice president of the Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit, the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, says companies’ failure to identify online users’ age and identities goes well beyond Grindr. But she says concerns about online predators have reached a tipping point — and companies and the lawmakers should do what it takes to keep boys and girls safe. In addition to age verification, she says there is technology to detect when people are lying about their age. <br/><br/>She also believes it’s important to focus on individual apps like Grindr to raise awareness among friends and family and push individual companies to find solutions. <br/><br/>“This is a problem across so many different platforms and demographics, but each platform has to answer for the ecosystem that it creates,’’ she said. “The technology is there.”<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1631020839629,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-7563-d063-a1fd-7d7f62fc0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1631020839629,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-7563-d063-a1fd-7d7f62fc0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;quote&quot;:&quot;&amp;quot;There are 14-year-old boys on Grindr right now.&amp;quot;&quot;,&quot;attribution&quot;:&quot;Chris Bates&quot;,&quot;fallbackToPerson&quot;:false,&quot;useGrayBackground&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017b-c06a-de7f-ab7f-c66b904a0011&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000162-022d-dc51-ab7b-96bf02e20008&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017b-c06a-de7f-ab7f-c66b8f8a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/><br/>Not everybody is seeking stricter laws. Kimberly Nelson, a professor of Community Health Sciences at the Boston University School of Public Health, says its natural for gay teens to head to Grindr to explore their sexuality. She said even if companies make it more difficult for young people to use their sites, it’s likely they will find workarounds. Instead, she said, teens should be given tools to better protect themselves, including advice on how to interact with people online and how to be careful about photo sharing. <br/><br/>“They’re not supposed to be on Grindr right now. They’re not supposed to be on these dating apps right now. They still are,’’ she said. “If we give them the tools that they need to interact in a way that is safe and protective for them, for me, that feels like the better intervention.”<br/><br/>Chris Bates, a Worcester-based trafficking survivor and advocate, wishes he had been given more warnings about sex trafficking in school when he was gay youth living in rural Connecticut. He says he first signed up for Grindr at 16 seeking attention that he lacked at home. With a simple check of a button, he lied about his age and entered into a world of adult men.<br/><br/>Bates, now 27 and a commissioner on the Massachusetts Unaccompanied Homeless Youth Commission, said he had no trouble meeting men he now describes as wolves who exploited him. In exchange for sex, they would offer him gifts of clothing, dinners and designer shoes, luxuries that his single mother couldn’t afford. He blames the men who purchased him but also the technology that made it so easy.<br/><br/>“There should be a responsibility on tech companies to make sure that young people are not on their apps,’’ he said<i>. </i>“There are 14-year-old boys on Grindr right now.” <br/><br/><i>Jenifer B.

Charlie Baker for his review.<br/><br/>Massachusetts is one of just four states in the country that started its fiscal year on July 1 and does not have an annual budget in place.

Article,"Brimfield Is Back: After A Pandemic-Induced Hiatus, New England's Most Famous Flea Market Returns","Brimfield Is Back: After A Pandemic-Induced Hiatus, New England's Most Famous Flea Market Returns","Since 1959, the town of Brimfield has been home to what it bills as the country’s oldest outdoor antique market. For three weekends a year, shoppers from across the globe descend on the Brimfield Flea Market in search of deals and unique finds. After pausing for COVID-19, the flea market is set to return in full swing starting next week.<br/><br/>“It&#39;s going to be business as usual, if not bigger and better than ever,” said Lori Faxon, owner of the Brimfield Antiques Center.<br/><br/>The flea market, which will be open July 13 through 18, is comprised of 21 independent antique shows. Each field has their own vendors, with some fields having as many as 400 vendors. It’s a huge draw — some buyers come from as far away as Australia to look for antiques. Brimfield Police Chief Charles Kuss emphasized how important the show is to Brimfield residents. <br/><br/>“It’s older than, say, half the population, maybe a little more, so a lot of people have devoted their whole lives,” Kuss said. “There’s a lot of high school kids that work there, a lot of young adults, all kinds of stories.”<br/><br/>Like most things, the flea market was affected by COVID-19. The fair shut down in 2020, but in May 2021, the Brimfield board of selectmen allowed the operators to open their fields so long as they followed COVID-19 guidelines. Many field owners felt the restrictions were too harsh and elected not to open for the first show weekend since September 2019. <br/><br/>One field did open for the first weekend of the 2021 season — Kate and Rusty Corriveau’s Brimfield Auction Acres. Kate Corriveau says the decision to open was well worth following the town’s guidelines. <br/><br/>“It was amazing,” Corriveau said. “Being the only show here, we just had, you know, a giant turnout. We had to count because of the COVID restriction. On the second day, we just stopped counting, because we just hovered at 1700 all day long.&quot;<br/><br/>Corriveau said she and Rusty felt an obligation to hold the show. Rusty has been involved with the flea market since he was in high school in the 1980s, when he worked parking cars on the same field that the Corriveaus now own. <br/><br/>“It’s been going on since 1959 on our field,” she said. “It&#39;s the oldest one, the first one. So there was really kind of more of a standout obligation.”<br/><br/>The new season brings new opportunities for vendors. Some are bringing COVID-era ideas to the current show season, including Klia Ververidis, ringmaster at Brimfield Antique Shows, LLC and owner and operator of Hertan’s Field. In 2020, she and other show promoters facilitated a virtual version of the Brimfield fair. <br/> <br/>“We had something like a half a million page views across platforms for that May show,” Ververidis said. “It&#39;s really turned into a pretty involved thing that we&#39;re going to continue now when the show goes back live.”<br/><br/>Ververidis says Leigh Keno of Antiques Roadshow will also be doing a live appraisal event on Hertan’s Field on July 17. <br/><br/>Faxon has been working with her “second family” at Brimfield for over 30 years, and she’s ready to get back to business. <br/><br/>“We usually see each other three times a year, and I haven&#39;t seen many of them since the fall of 2019,” Faxon said. “So I guess I&#39;m most excited about seeing all of our customers return. You know, being able to give them a hug.”<br/><br/>The Brimfield Flea Market will also be open Sept. 7-12 this year.

Engaged couples whose plans were upended by the pandemic are tying the knot in droves. <br/><br/>Which means those in the wedding industry are scrambling to meet the increasing demand as brides and grooms are now having the weddings they&#39;ve always dreamed of. <br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1626629362141,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1626629362141,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000179-4416-de59-a579-cf3e28070003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000178-54a8-db79-a379-5cfe46c10000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000173-084e-d310-ad77-beefc5450003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017a-ba94-dd7d-a57b-bf9ce9b6000d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017a-ba94-dd7d-a57b-bf9ce9850000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/><br/>Wedding planner Jodi Raphael likens this summer&#39;s bridal season to a wedding tsunami. &quot;There was a switch that flipped on, really we didn&#39;t stop,&quot; she explains. <br/><br/>Raphael owns Jodi Raphael Events in Newton. She has been in the wedding planning business for 20 years and says she worked right through the pandemic along with her three full-time employees. <br/><br/>&quot;We didn&#39;t pick our heads up from March to July last year,&quot; she said. &quot;We were rescheduling and getting people replaced, calling places where people weren&#39;t answering phones, consoling brides and grooms. ... It was like Groundhog Day every day. It was the same conversations, and we weren&#39;t able to get anywhere.&quot;<br/><br/>Almost half the couples who had planned to get married last year postponed their wedding until this summer, according to a nationwide survey conducted by The Knot, a popular website that offers guidance on wedding planning. Raphael said her bookings are up 50% compared with pre-pandemic years and noted that everyone in the industry has been impacted by the upheaval.<br/><br/>&quot;There are shortages of paper. There are issues with flowers,&quot; she said. &quot;Everything has changed.&quot;<br/><br/>Not only is it difficult to order flowers and paper, overall wedding costs are up dramatically from a year ago, according to The Knot. Massachusetts weddings are the third most expensive nationwide, trailing only New York and Rhode Island, at more than $43,000.<br/><br/>Raphael says some couples who are trying to cut down on costs are opting for weekday weddings, adding that weekend weddings are not only more expensive but harder to book. She is now scheduling weddings into 2023. &quot;We are seeing competition amongst brides to book their dates. There is a real sense of urgency,&quot; she said.<br/><br/>Stephanie Berenson, who owns Stephanie Berenson Photography, agrees. &quot;Things just went from zero to 100 with masked mandates being lifted,&quot; she said.<br/><br/>Berenson started up her Boston-based business full time six months before the pandemic hit. The 27-year-old says she suffers from asthma and sat home for the first three months after the economic shut down and, in order to save on finances, moved back in with her parents. <br/><br/>She says business slowly picked up last summer. &quot;I did a lot of micro weddings last year with 10 people or fewer, just intimate family weddings,&quot; she said. &quot;I actually feel like a lot of my couples enjoyed the more intimate weddings because they told me they really got to do what they actually wanted rather than do this big wedding.&quot;<br/><br/>Christa and Kyle Audet, who are both in their mid-30s, decided to do both. They had a micro wedding last year and their big dream wedding with friends and family last month. (The Knot&#39;s survey showed that 32% of engaged couples took a similar route.)<br/><br/>Christa works in media production and Kyle is a CPA. They live in South Boston and began planning their wedding in 2019. <br/><br/>Neither of them wanted to wait. Their micro wedding was a private ceremony in downtown Boston in June of last year. Christa says it was just the two of them and their Justice of the Peace. <br/><br/>&quot;We were going to meet our JP at this beautiful corner of the Public Garden under this gorgeous tree,&quot; she said. &quot;It was a beautiful day, and I&#39;m cool as a cucumber. We walk up to the JP and as soon as she started our vows, I just lost it. It really hit me how real it was, how excited I was and we were really making it official.&quot;<br/><br/>She said there were some special elements as well. &quot;Another couple was having their pictures taken and the photographer took a quick photo of us and got our kiss at the end of our vows. She then ran over to us quickly and gave us her business card and said, &#39;Email me, I&#39;ve got a photo of your kiss.&#39; It was precious. It was special,&quot; she recalled.<br/><br/>But Christa didn&#39;t wear her wedding dress. She wanted to save that for a church wedding, complete with 150 guests. It took place last month on June 12th — the exact date of their civil wedding a year ago. <br/><br/>&quot;Everyone was vaccinated. We were able to have a wedding without masks, and to be able to hug and dance and have a walkup bar and all of the planning was worth it, all of the postponements and tough days,&quot; she said. &quot;There were tough days that we had leading up to the wedding and everything just fell away.&quot;<br/><br/>Berenson says this joy is reflected in all of the couples who she&#39;s photographed on their wedding day since the state of emergency was lifted in Massachusetts over the Memorial Day weekend. <br/><br/>&quot;&#39;Love is not canceled&#39; are the famous words that everybody has been saying this year, and it&#39;s nice to feel like things are coming back to life, back to normal,&quot; Berenson says.<br/><br/>So far she has 25 weddings booked through the fall and several of them are scheduled back-to-back — and the phone keeps ringing.<br/>",Mary Blake,Fri Jul 16 13:15:13 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Article,Hurley Building Redevelopment To Test Future of Work Strategies,Hurley Building Redevelopment To Test Future of Work Strategies,"The Baker administration is moving ahead with plans to redevelop the Charles F. Hurley Building in Boston by leasing the entire property to a private development partner that would handle the planning, financing, and construction of a project to &quot;leverage the location&#39;s untapped real estate value.&quot;<br/><br/>The Division of Capital Asset Management and Maintenance announced Thursday that it is launching the formal process of finding and selecting, through a competitive process, a developer to partner with. First round <a href=""https://my.rcm1.com/handler/modern.aspx?pv=J1TYu7b3lpXtuimdUSrJyYHgYEuP382DGj6MMRMuW2aUDG_4Oi5pH7zaPbACQ_al#_top"" style=""color: rgb(0, 106, 199); text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-skip-ink: none;"">offering materials</a> will be released next week and DCAMM said it expects to make a selection in the coming months.<br/><br/>The 327,000 square-foot building owned by the government and opened in 1971 houses a variety of state offices, but it has become costly to maintain and is in need of major renovations, according to the Baker administration. The Hurley Building is situated on a 3.25-acre site bounded by Cambridge, New Chardon, and Staniford streets not far from the State House.<br/><br/>&quot;This is an exciting project for the Commonwealth and a tremendous opportunity to further enhance the economic vibrancy of Downtown Boston,&quot; DCAMM Commissioner Carol Gladstone said. &quot;This project will ensure we better utilize an asset that is not meeting the needs of the Commonwealth or local residents and it will also serve as an opportunity to showcase the approach to our Future of Work initiative.&quot;<br/><br/>The project was <a href=""https://statehousenews.com/news/20191985"" style=""color: rgb(0, 106, 199); text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-skip-ink: none;"">first proposed</a> in October 2019 and DCAMM said it has spent the last year and a half talking to neighbors, stakeholders and others to develop design guidelines and expectations, &quot;including a preference that redevelopment proposals prioritize adaptive reuse or rehabilitation of the existing building.&quot;<br/><br/>In 2019, the administration said the plan was to have a developer build out modern office space for public use that the state would control long-term with the intention of moving most, if not all, of the 675 employees who were then working in the building back to that location. DCAMM had originally hoped to select a development partner in the summer of 2020, which would have put the project completion date in 2025. <br/>",Colin A.

They said appeals to shelter officials, local police as well as state and federal authorities were brushed off. Advocates for the homeless also alleged that clients of the shelter had been abused.<br/><br/>The Fitchburg police and Our Father&#39;s House both launched investigations of the allegations — first raised at a January meeting of the Fitchburg Human Rights Commission — but the police closed their investigation in April, concluding there was not enough evidence to press charges.

Article,Defrocked Cardinal McCarrick Charged With 1974 Sexual Abuse Of A Minor In Massachusetts,Defrocked Cardinal McCarrick Charged With 1974 Sexual Abuse Of A Minor In Massachusetts,"Former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick is facing criminal charges for allegedly sexually assaulting a teenage boy during a wedding reception on the campus of Wellesley College in the 1970s. <br/><br/>&quot;Historically, this is the first cardinal the United States ever charged criminally for a sexual offense against a minor,&quot; Attorney Mitchell Garabedian, who is representing the alleged victim, told GBH News.<br/><br/>The criminal complaint filed in the Dedham District Court, says McCarrick was a friend of the alleged victim’s family. It alleges multiple instances of abuse, including in New Jersey, New York, California and Massachusetts. McCarrick was only charged for his alleged abuse at the 1974 wedding reception at Wellesley College. The alleged victim was 16 at the time and was at his brother’s wedding.<br/><br/>A spokesperson for the Middlesex District Attorney’s office says an investigation there is ongoing.<br/><br/>&quot;By reporting the sexual abuse to criminal authorities, my client is empowering other victims and making the world a safer place for children,&quot; Garabedian said.<br/><br/>McCarrick, the former archbishop of Washington, D.C., was defrocked by Pope Francis in 2019 after a Vatican investigation confirmed reports of sexual abuse.

Those “co-response” cars already exist, but Janey said they currently can be sent to any kind of call.<br/><br/>“So we are making these mental health teams available for the calls that would benefit from their presence the most,” she said.<br/><br/>The co-response pilot will begin this fall in Charlestown, downtown Boston and Roxbury. <br/><br/>A second model would send EMTs to respond to mental health calls, paired with mental health workers.<br/><br/>“This approach does not involve police officers and has been implemented in cities across the country,” Janey said. “This frees up police officers to focus on violent crime rather than on mental health calls.”<br/><br/>The city is also looking into developing a third model that would include a response by trained community members. <br/><br/>The pilot program is being funded with $1.75 million from the city’s Health and Human Services budget for fiscal year 2022.<br/><br/>“I want to make clear that the investment of $1.75 million is not going to the police budget,” Janey said.<br/><br/>Boston Police Deputy Superintendent Peter Messina voiced his support for the plan.<br/><br/>“Our role in this is very straightforward,” Messina said. “We&#39;ve had co-response in the city of Boston for 10-plus years now, but it hasn&#39;t been formalized. This formalizes that process. It&#39;s been a fantastic working relationship with all the different agencies involved.”<br/><br/>911 dispatchers will be trained to determine which is the appropriate response for each call.<br/><br/>“So when that 911 call comes in, the dispatcher is going to say, ‘all right, this call has some sort of a mental health nexus to it,’” Messina said. And if necessary, “they’ll hail that car with that officer and that co-response clinician.”<br/><br/>Boston EMS Chief Jim Hooley was optimistic that adding mental health clinicians to calls could help calm certain situations.<br/><br/>“They can perhaps help to manage some of the scenes a little bit better, bring a little bit more information, inform the officers and us in better ways to handle some of these scenes,” he said.<br/>",Craig LeMoult,Thu Aug 05 18:27:00 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Article,New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo Resigning Over Sexual Harassment,New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo Resigning Over Sexual Harassment,"NEW YORK (AP) — Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced his resignation Tuesday over a barrage of sexual harassment allegations in a fall from grace a year after he was widely hailed nationally for his detailed daily briefings and leadership during the pandemic’s peak.<br/><br/>In a televised address, the 63-year-old Democrat emphatically denied intentionally showing any disrespect toward women but said that fighting back against what he called the “politically motivated” attack on him would subject the state to months of turmoil, and “I cannot be the cause of that.”<br/><br/>“The best way I can help now is if I step aside and let government get back to government,” Cuomo said.<br/><br/>The three-term Democratic governor’s decision, which will take effect in two weeks, was announced as momentum built in the Legislature to remove him by impeachment. It came after New York’s attorney general released the results of an investigation that found Cuomo sexually harassed at least 11 women.<br/><br/>Investigators said he subjected women to unwanted kisses; groped their breasts or buttocks or otherwise touched them inappropriately; made insinuating remarks about their looks and their sex lives; and created a work environment “rife with fear and intimidation.”<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1628613584630,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000168-2a01-dff6-a1ef-fabd12060000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1628613584630,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000168-2a01-dff6-a1ef-fabd12060000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017b-26c1-d289-ab7b-f6c396310003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017b-1147-d5be-a57b-bdcf3bd10003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017b-0e09-d289-ab7b-fe8bc1730003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017b-30ee-d5be-a57b-bdee14ce0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017b-30ee-d5be-a57b-bdee147b0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul, a 62-year-old Democrat and former member of Congress from the Buffalo area, will become the state’s 57th governor and the first woman to hold the post.<br/><br/>The #MeToo-era scandal cut short not just a career but a dynasty: Cuomo’s father, Mario Cuomo, was governor in the 1980s and ’90s, and the younger Cuomo was often mentioned as a potential candidate for president, an office his father famously contemplated seeking. Even as the scandal mushroomed, Cuomo was planning to run for reelection in 2022.<br/><br/>Cuomo still faces the possibility of criminal charges, with a number of prosecutors around the state moving to investigate him.<br/><br/>The string of accusations that spelled the governor’s downfall began to unfold in news reports last December and went on for months.<br/><br/>Cuomo called some of the allegations fabricated, forcefully denying he touched anyone inappropriately. But he acknowledged making some aides uncomfortable with comments he said he intended as playful, and he apologized for some of his behavior.<br/><br/>He portrayed some of the encounters as misunderstandings attributable to “generational or cultural” differences, a reference in part to his upbringing in an affectionate Italian American family.<br/><br/>As a defiant Cuomo clung to office, state lawmakers launched an impeachment investigation, and nearly the entire Democratic establishment in New York deserted him — not only over the accusations, but also because of the discovery that his administration had concealed thousands of COVID-19 deaths among nursing home patients.<br/><br/>The harassment investigation ordered up by the attorney general and conducted by two outside lawyers corroborated the women’s accounts and added lurid new ones. The release of the report left the governor more isolated than ever, with some of his most loyal supporters abandoning him and President Joe Biden joining those calling on him to resign.<br/><br/>His accusers included an aide who said Cuomo groped her breast at the governor’s mansion. Investigators also the governor’s staff retaliated against one of his accusers by leaking confidential personnel files about her.<br/><br/>As governor, Cuomo touted himself as an example of a “progressive Democrat” who gets things done: Since taking office in 2011, he helped push through legislation that legalized gay marriage, began lifting the minimum wage to $15 and expanded paid family leave benefits. He also backed big infrastructure projects, including airport overhauls and construction of a new bridge over the Hudson River that he named after his father.<br/><br/>At the same time the behavior that got him into trouble was going on, he was publicly championing the #MeToo movement and surrounding himself with women’s rights activists, signing into law sweeping new protections against sexual harassment and lengthening the statute of limitations in rape cases.<br/><br/>His national popularity soared during the harrowing spring of 2020, when New York became the epicenter of the nation’s coronavirus outbreak.<br/><br/>His tough-minded but empathetic response made for riveting television well beyond New York, and his stern warnings to people to stay home and wear masks stood in sharp contrast to President Donald Trump’s brush-off of the virus. His briefings won an international Emmy Award, and he went on to write a book on leadership in a crisis.<br/><br/>But even those accomplishments were soon tainted when it was learned that the state’s official count of nursing home deaths had excluded many patients who had been transferred to hospitals before they succumbed. A Cuomo aide acknowledged the administration feared the true numbers would be “used against us” by the Trump White House.<br/><br/>Also, Cuomo’s administration was fiercely criticized for forcing nursing homes to accept patients recovering from the virus.<br/><br/>The U.S. Justice Department is investigating the state’s handling of data on nursing home deaths. In addition, the state attorney general is looking into whether Cuomo broke the law in using members of his staff to help write and promote his book, from which he stood to make more than $5 million.<br/><br/>The governor had also increasingly come under fire over his rough and sometimes vindictive treatment of fellow politicians and his own staff, with former aides telling stories of a brutal work environment.<br/><br/>Cuomo has been divorced since 2005 from the author and activist Kerry Kennedy, a member of the Kennedy family, and was romantically involved up until 2019 with TV lifestyle personality Sandra Lee. He has three adult daughters.<br/><br/>During his resignation speech, he directly addressed his daughters, saying: “I want them to know, from the bottom of my heart: I never did, and I never would, intentionally disrespect a woman or treat a woman differently than I would want them treated. Your dad made mistakes. And he apologized. And he learned from it. And that’s what life is all about.”<br/><br/>He gained political experience early on as his father’s hard-nosed and often ruthless campaign manager, and went on to become New York attorney general and U.S. housing secretary under President Bill Clinton before getting elected governor in 2010.<br/><br/>New York has seen a string of high-level political figures brought down in disgrace in recent years.<br/><br/>Gov. Eliot Spitzer resigned in 2008 in a call-girl scandal. Rep. Anthony Weiner went to prison for sexting with a 15-year-old girl.

Article,Everett May Go Without A Mayoral Debate After Collapse Of Event Last Weekend,Everett May Go Without A Mayoral Debate After Collapse Of Event Last Weekend,"The first, and so far only, debate for Everett’s mayoral candidates fell apart Saturday, with a series of miscommunications leaving everyone discontented, and the city’s voters still without a way to directly compare the candidates. <br/><br/>Contenders were set to debate in front of an audience at the city’s Skyplex Venue on Aug. 7, hosted by the Everett Haitian Community Center and broadcast on multiple radio stations, WhatsApp and RokuTV. But in the end, two candidates stood outside locked doors Saturday night talking to community members in clusters, with no stage and no debate. <br/><br/>Invitations had been sent out July 26 via email, and City Councilors Gerly Adrien and Fred Capone RSVPed early, but incumbent Mayor Carlo DeMaria announced Friday that he couldn’t attend. Everyone, including the host organization, had a story about why the debate didn’t move forward in the end. <br/><br/>Rev. Myrlande DesRosiers, director of EHCC, said Capone and Adrien had confirmed, and DeMaria said he wasn’t attending the day before the event in a Facebook post. <br/><br/>“We were still going to do it because we had positive answers from Capone and Adrien,” she said, but then Capone’s campaign, “last minute, very late in the process, told us they would not participate because the venue is not handicap accessible.” <br/><br/>Because the debate couldn’t be “unilateral,” she said it had to be cancelled. <br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1628790667126,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-fe91-d9b7-abe6-feb1834f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1628790667126,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-fe91-d9b7-abe6-feb1834f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000178-dbad-dbb7-a7ff-dbefb9070002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000177-b23c-d411-a977-fb3f0b490003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000177-b1ca-d244-a57f-fbfb26a20003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017b-3b69-daa6-ad7f-ffed3358001b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017b-3b69-daa6-ad7f-ffed30f70000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>“I think it was just a simple misunderstanding,” said Capone. He said he inquired several times before Saturday if the group would consider holding the debate elsewhere, even at a park, because of his accessibility concerns, and never heard back. The venue, he said, was up multiple flights of stairs. <br/><br/>“The cancellation said only one candidate was interested in debating, and I responded immediately saying, ‘I’m going, I know another candidate is going. Please reconsider,’” he said in a phone interview. He asked if they would consider postponing the mayoral portion of the debate — as candidates for the School Committee were also going to debate — if a better location couldn’t be found. “I think it was misunderstood that I said I wasn’t going.” <br/><br/>Right after the cancellation, he headed to the venue, and found the doors locked. <br/><br/>“I think it would have been more beneficial for everyone if all three candidates were there, but clearly I would have debated. I don’t know that the value of two challengers debating each other about an incumbent — but I showed up,” he said. <br/><br/>Adrien showed up, too. “I had four debate prep sessions prior to the debate, so we were ready,” she said. “I think it was disappointing that our mayor, the day before the debate, realized he had a conflict, when we’ve known about it — it was in the local newspapers that same week.” <br/><br/>DeMaria’s campaign did not make him available for an interview but instead sent the same statement from his campaign Facebook page through campaign director Philip Melki. <br/><br/>“The debate proposed for Saturday evening directly conflicts with another obligation that my team and I have already committed to and therefore will not be able to attend,” it said. “As I have communicated to the host organization, I look forward to the opportunity to engage with those Everett residents who planned to attend or view the forum in the near future at a time that works for all.” <br/><br/>His campaign didn’t note what other event he had to attend before deadline, nor did it mention why he took 11 days to bow out of the debate. <br/><br/>The race for Everett mayor has been particularly contentious between Adrien and DeMaria. In January, the mayor accused the councilwoman of behaving rudely during a City Council meeting, including raising her voice and pointing her finger at other members. Adrien <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2021/02/15/everett-city-councilor-gerly-adrien-says-shes-not-afraid-of-intimidation-from-mayor-colleagues"" target=""_blank"">told</a> <i>Boston Public Radio</i> that she feels the weight of being deemed an “aggressive Black woman” by other councilors and the mayor when she expresses an opinion. Video of the meeting <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2021/02/17/everett-mayor-demaria-denies-claims-of-racism-fires-back-with-accusations-of-rude-and-ignorant-behavior-against-councilor-adrien"" target=""_blank"">reviewed by GBH News</a> did not show Adrien pointing her finger or raising her voice. <br/><br/>The Haitian nonprofit said it will attempt to reschedule the debate.<br/><br/>EHCC director DesRosiers stressed that she has “positive relationships” with all of the candidates. She added that the organization decided to host the debate when it discovered only a few forums would be held, but no actual interactive debate, calling it a “critical election at a critical time.” <br/><br/>Haitians, DesRosiers said, are the largest ethnic voting bloc in the city. “The point of the debate was to see who among the candidates could lead Everett to a better tomorrow, something better than what it has been,” she said.<br/><br/>All of the candidates expressed interest in attending if the debate is rescheduled. As of press time, one candidate forum is planned for August 31, but no debates before the Sept. 21 election.

Article,Afghan President Flees The Country As Taliban Move On Kabul,Afghan President Flees The Country As Taliban Move On Kabul,"Afghanistan’s embattled president left the country Sunday, joining his fellow citizens and foreigners in a stampede fleeing the advancing Taliban and signaling the end of a 20-year Western experiment aimed at remaking Afghanistan.<br/><br/>The Taliban entered the capital early Sunday and an official in the militant group said it would soon announce the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan from the presidential palace — a return rich in symbolism to the name of the country under the Taliban government ousted by U.S.-led forces after the 9/11 attacks.

The embassy also suspended its own operations.<br/><br/>Still, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken rejected comparisons to the U.S. pullout from Vietnam, as many watched in disbelief at the sight of helicopters landing in the embassy compound to take diplomats to a new outpost at Kabul International Airport.<br/><br/>“This is manifestly not Saigon,” he said on ABC’s “This Week.&quot;<br/><br/>The American ambassador was among those evacuated, said officials who spoke condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss ongoing military operations. He was asking to return to the embassy, but it was not clear if he would be allowed to.<br/><br/>As the insurgents closed in Sunday, President Ashraf Ghani flew out of the country.<br/><br/>“The former president of Afghanistan left Afghanistan, leaving the country in this difficult situation,&quot; said Abdullah Abdullah, the head of the Afghan National Reconciliation Council. &quot;God should hold him accountable.”<br/><br/>In a stunning rout, the Taliban seized nearly all of Afghanistan in just over a week, despite the billions of dollars spent by the U.S. and NATO over nearly two decades to build up Afghan security forces. Just days earlier, an American military assessment estimated it would be a month before the capital would come under insurgent pressure.<br/><br/>The fall of Kabul marks the final chapter of America&#39;s longest war, which began after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks masterminded by al-Qaida&#39;s Osama bin Laden, then harbored by the Taliban government. A U.S.-led invasion dislodged the Taliban and beat them back, though America lost focus on the conflict in the chaos of the Iraq War.<br/><br/>For years, the U.S. has been looking for an exit for the war. Washington under then-President Donald Trump signed a deal with the Taliban in February 2020 that limited direct military action against the insurgents. That allowed the fighters to gather strength and move quickly to seize key areas when President Joe Biden announced his plans to withdraw all American forces by the end of this month.<br/><br/>On Sunday, the insurgents entered the outskirts of Kabul but initially remained outside of the city&#39;s downtown. Meanwhile, Taliban negotiators in the capital discussed a transfer of power, said an Afghan official. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details of the closed-doors negotiations, described them as “tense.”<br/><br/>It remained unclear when that transfer would take place and who among the Taliban was negotiating. The negotiators on the government side included former President Hamid Karzai, leader of Hizb-e-Islami political and paramilitary group Gulbudin Hekmatyar and Abdullah, who has been a vocal critic of Ghani.<br/><br/>Karzai himself appeared in a video posted online, his three young daughters around him, saying he remained in Kabul.<br/><br/>“We are trying to solve the issue of Afghanistan with the Taliban leadership peacefully,” he said, while the roar of a passing helicopter could be heard overhead.<br/><br/>Afghanistan’s acting defense minister, Bismillah Khan Mohammadi, didn’t hold back his criticism of the fleeing president.<br/><br/>“They tied our hands from behind and sold the country,” he wrote on Twitter. “Curse Ghani and his gang.”<br/><br/>The insurgents tried to calm residents of the capital, insisting their fighters wouldn’t enter people’s homes or interfere with businesses. They also said they’d offer an “amnesty” to those who worked with the Afghan government or foreign forces.<br/><br/>But there have been reports of revenge killings and other brutal tactics in areas of the country the Taliban have seized in recent days — and the reports of gunfire at the airport raised the specter of more violence. One female journalist, weeping, sent voice messages to colleagues after armed men entered her apartment building and banged on her door.<br/><br/>“What should I do? Should I call the police or Taliban?” Getee Azami cried. It wasn&#39;t clear what happened to her after that.<br/><br/>Many chose to flee, rushing to the Kabul airport, <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/europe-middle-east-health-coronavirus-pandemic-kabul-beb4a264f9d74ba5f1d0e40607c5e773"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; color: var(--linkLightColor); text-decoration: none; background-color: transparent; font-size: inherit; cursor: pointer; outline: none; font-family: &quot;AP Serif&quot;; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;"">the last route out of the country</a> as the Taliban now hold every border crossing. NATO said it was “helping to maintain operations at Kabul airport to keep Afghanistan connected with the world.”<br/><br/>One Afghan university student described feeling betrayed as she watched the evacuation of the U.S. Embassy.<br/><br/>“You failed the younger generation of Afghanistan,” said Aisha Khurram, 22, who is now unsure of whether she’ll be able to graduate in two months&#39; time. “A generation ... raised in the modern Afghanistan were hoping to build the country with their own hands. They put blood, efforts and sweat into whatever we had right now.&quot;<br/><br/>Sunday began with the Taliban seizing the nearby city of Jalalabad — which had been the last major city besides the capital not in their hands. Afghan officials said the militants also took the capitals of Maidan Wardak, Khost, Kapisa and Parwan provinces, as well as the country&#39;s last government-held border post.<br/><br/>Later, Afghan forces at Bagram air base, home to a prison housing 5,000 inmates, surrendered to the Taliban, according to Bagram district chief Darwaish Raufi.

I think for hundreds of years there was cruelty for women, but they survived and they shined.”<br/><br/>But even while trying to stay positive, Jan, who said her students and teachers in Afghanistan are safe at the moment, choked up at one point while talking about the situation in the country. <br/><br/>Beth Murphy, a filmmaker who made <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/international-news/2021/08/03/there-is-a-great-future-for-these-girls-the-push-to-educate-women-in-afghanistan"" target=""_blank"">a film</a> about Jan’s efforts in Afghanistan, said what’s happening is “just literally our worst nightmare.”<br/><br/>Still, she said, it’s a time for action. <br/><br/>“And there’s so many people that I and my colleagues who are here are trying to help, and there are so many people who are in real danger right now because of what’s happening,” Murphy said. <br/><br/>Though there is grave concern over what a Taliban-controlled Afghanistan will look like, it’s still unclear what exactly the future holds. <br/><br/>Thomas Barfield, a professor at Boston University who heads the <a href=""https://afghan-institute.org/about/staff/"" target=""_blank"">American Institute of Afghanistan Studies</a>, is trying to keep a level head about what happens next in the country. <br/><br/>“I don’t want to be like, ‘It’s the end of the world!,’ but it could go really horrible or better than we think,” he said. “And that’s one of the reasons the Afghans right now are so upset. Because literally in two weeks their world is turned upside down.”<br/><br/>Barfield, who has been working for weeks to get staffers for his institute out of the country, said there is noise that the Taliban have made some progress when it comes to human rights. But to what extent is yet to be seen. <br/><br/>“They did not receive international recognition in the 1990s, only three countries recognized them. They were pariahs, they don’t want to end up the North Korea of central Asia,” he said. “On the other hand, what I don’t know is, so, who controls Taliban policy, who speaks for them? That’s why I’m watching what’s happening in Kabul, where does it go? And you can see a positive sort of thing that maybe they’ve moderated in some ways, or you can go just the opposite and look [at] what ISIS did in Iraq and Syria.”<br/><br/>The Taliban takeover is a dramatic final act to the longest war in American history, and Barfield said it’s clear the Biden administration didn’t think through the consequences of the swift departure of U.S. forces. <br/><br/>“God, [Biden] wanted so badly to avoid a Vietnam analogy and he set it up perfectly,” he said. “Helicopters leaving embassies. ... People left behind. Everything the United States wanted to avoid, Biden, by trying to get out so fast, produced.”<br/><br/>In Cambridge, Kamal only had a few minutes to speak before the dinner rush, but he had a succinct explanation for what is happening in Afghanistan. <br/><br/>“Just a tough situation, helpless people that can’t defend for themselves,” he said. “They relied on the U.S. for the most part, U.S. kind of abandoned them like most other countries did. And now, it’s just them to fend for themselves against their own people for the most part.”<br/><br/><i>GBH News&#39; Mary Blake contributed to this story. </i>",Esteban Bustillos,Sun Aug 15 20:42:34 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But What About Afghan Refugees?","Yesterday, Afghanistan’s government fell and the Taliban once again took control of a country that the United States had been fighting to prop up for two decades. For many watching from the United States, a single — and urgent — priority emerged: Evacuating Afghan translators and others who had allied with U.S. forces, as quickly as possible. <br/><br/>John Velis, a Bronze star Army veteran who served two tours in Afghanistan who is now a state senator in Massachusetts, said Monday that he had received a call from an Afghan translator he’d worked with. The translator is still in Afghanistan. <br/><br/>“[He] said that the Taliban were going door to door in his neighborhood,” Velis said. “And he said, &#39;I&#39;ve been left behind.&#39; And I don&#39;t, I don&#39;t have a response for that right now, and that really pains me.” <br/><br/>U.S. Rep Seth Moulton has been vocal about the need to get translators to safety as U.S. troops rapidly withdrew.

But its slow-moving bureaucracy and limited resources have been known roadblocks <a href=""https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/emmaloop/a-bipartisan-group-of-senators-wants-more-visas-for"" target=""_blank"">for years</a>. <br/><br/>President Joe Biden spoke about the program in his address Monday, saying that 2,000 SIV-eligible Afghans have been moved to the United States since July under Operation Allies Refuge. <br/><br/>“In the coming days, the U.S. military will provide assistance to move more SIV-eligible Afghans and their families out of Afghanistan,” Biden said. “We&#39;re also expanding refugee access to cover other vulnerable Afghans who worked for our embassy, U.S. non-government agencies or the U.S. non-governmental organizations and Afghans who otherwise are at great risk.”<br/><br/>Rahmatulla Aka came to the United States in 2015 from Afghanistan through the SIV program. Now, he works at the International Institute of New England in Boston. <br/><br/>“Those people that worked alongside the U.S. mission, they are all scared,” he said. “That&#39;s why they are rushing to the airport, they&#39;re rushing to find a way to move out because they know that they [the Taliban] will come up to their homes and they will be targeted and they will be taken away.”<br/><br/>The United States could use another program to help ordinary Afghan citizens: It could designate Afghanistan for Temporary Protected Status (TPS), says Daniel Pereira with the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition. That would make a set number of Afghan people eligible to come to the United States for a prolonged period of time to escape conflict, where they would be able to work and not be removed or detained based on their immigration status. <br/><br/>“What we want to see going forward is a strong commitment to helping everyone, to helping every person in Afghanistan who is seeking asylum, who is seeking refuge as a result of this ongoing political and military crisis,” Pereira told GBH News. <br/><br/>Waheed Zarif came to the United States for the first time in 2005 to go to high school and went on to study at Dartmouth College. He applied for asylum in the U.S. after his father was killed.<br/><br/>Although he&#39;s safely in America, he still has family he&#39;s trying to get out of Afghanistan. <br/><br/>“The border crossings are closed. What I&#39;m trying to do is hopefully get them a visa to one of the neighboring countries,&quot; Zarif said. &quot;Just remain there for a few months, maybe a year to see if the situation improves.&quot;<br/><br/>The rapid evacuation from Kabul, as well as the chaotic scenes at the city’s airport, drew comparisons to the American exit from Saigon at the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. Anh Vu Sawyer was a college student who left Saigon that day — she boarded an American helicopter and came to the United States, where she is now the executive director of the Southeast Asian Coalition of Central Massachusetts in Worcester.<br/><br/>Vietnamese refugees and immigrants, Sawyer <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/international-news/2021/08/16/be-prepared-to-support-afghanistans-refugees-saigon-evacuee-hopes-americans-will-open-their-hearts-and-doors"" target=""_blank"">said Monday</a>, have “contributed to this country, not because we have to give back, but we want to give back and we want to have a part in the thriving, in the vibrancy, of this country. And we take great pride of being Americans.<br/><br/>“I would like very much for Americans, people everywhere in this country, to be prepared to support Afghanistan&#39;s refugees the same way they did for Vietnamese,” she continued. “After all, the U.S. presence in the Middle East had been there for a long time, the same in Vietnam, and mistakes were made. ...

He said that he’s been trying to get those at the institute in Kabul out of the country for the last two weeks.<br/><br/>Barfield said nobody knows whether the Taliban reign this time will be more moderate than their hard-line rule two decades ago. “And that&#39;s one of the reasons the Afghans right now are so upset.

","North Andover 8th Graders Lead Effort To Pardon Wrongly Convicted 'Witch'
","BOSTON (AP) — More than three centuries after a Massachusetts woman was wrongly convicted of witchcraft and sentenced to death, she’s finally on the verge of being exonerated — thanks to a curious eighth-grade civics class.<br/><br/>State Sen. Diana DiZoglio, a Democrat from Methuen, has introduced legislation to clear the name of Elizabeth Johnson Jr., who was condemned in 1693 at the height of the Salem Witch Trials but never executed.<br/><br/>DiZoglio says she was inspired by sleuthing done by a group of 13- and 14-year-olds at North Andover Middle School. Civics teacher Carrie LaPierre’s students painstakingly researched Johnson and the steps that would need to be taken to make sure she was formally pardoned.<br/><br/>“It is important that we work to correct history,” DiZoglio said Wednesday. “We will never be able to change what happened to these victims, but at the very least, we can set the record straight.”<br/><br/>If lawmakers approve the measure, Johnson will be the last accused witch to be cleared, according to Witches of Massachusetts Bay, a group devoted to the history and lore of the 17th-century witch hunts.<br/><br/>Twenty people from Salem and neighboring towns were killed and hundreds of others accused during <a href=""chrome-extension://oknpjjbmpnndlpmnhmekjpocelpnlfdi/article/82cdc2d0240a43e49897ec817a1418e5"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(240, 96, 64); text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(240, 96, 64); transition: border-bottom-color 0.15s ease-out 0s, color 0.2s ease-out 0s;"">a frenzy of Puritan injustice that began in 1692</a>, stoked by superstition, fear of disease and strangers, scapegoating and petty jealousies. Nineteen were hanged, and one man was crushed to death by rocks.<br/><br/>In the 328 years that have ensued, dozens of suspects officially were cleared, including Johnson’s own mother, the daughter of a minister whose conviction eventually was reversed. But for some reason, Johnson’s name wasn’t included in various legislative attempts to set the record straight.<br/><br/>Johnson was 22 when she was caught up in the hysteria of the witch trials and sentenced to hang. It never happened: Then-Gov. William Phips threw out her punishment as the magnitude of the gross miscarriages of justice in Salem sank in.<br/><br/>But because she wasn’t among those whose convictions were formally set aside, hers still technically stands.<br/><br/>“It showed how superstitious people still were after the witch trials,” said Artem Likhanov, 14, a rising high school freshman who participated in the school project. “It’s not like after it ended people didn’t believe in witches anymore. They still thought she was a witch and they wouldn’t exonerate her.”<br/><br/>DiZoglio’s bill would tweak 1957 legislation, amended in 2001, to include Johnson among others who were pardoned after being wrongly accused and convicted of witchcraft.<br/><br/>“Why Elizabeth was not exonerated is unclear but no action was ever taken on her behalf by the General Assembly or the courts,” DiZoglio said. “Possibly because she was neither a wife nor a mother, she was not considered worthy of having her name cleared. And because she never had children, there is no group of descendants acting on her behalf.”<br/><br/>In 2017, officials unveiled <a href=""chrome-extension://oknpjjbmpnndlpmnhmekjpocelpnlfdi/article/north-america-ma-state-wire-us-news-ap-top-news-massachusetts-fdc9669b8ecf48918758f5463d653b64"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(240, 96, 64); text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(240, 96, 64); transition: border-bottom-color 0.15s ease-out 0s, color 0.2s ease-out 0s;"">a semi-circular stone wall memorial inscribed with the names of people hanged</a> at a site in Salem known as Proctor’s Ledge. It was funded in part by donations from descendants of those accused of being witches.<br/><br/>LaPierre, the teacher, said some of her students initially were ambivalent about the effort to exonerate Johnson because they launched it before the 2020 presidential election and at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic was raging.<br/><br/>“Some of the conversation was, ‘Why are we doing this? She’s dead. Isn’t there more important stuff going on in the world?’” she said. “But they came around to the idea that it’s important that in some small way we could do this one thing.”<br/>",William J.

But they want to make sure those riders wear a mask.<br/><br/>Last week, the Transportation Security Administration extended its mask requirement for planes, buses, trains and other public transportation until January of 2022.<br/><br/>&quot;That means that everybody, everybody has to wear a mask on the MBTA,&quot; Ken Green, the MBTA Transit Police Chief said at a press conference Thursday at the Back Bay station. &quot;We&#39;ve seen a high level of compliance across the system.&quot;<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1630008419985,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-e4be-dadb-a77e-f5be3b2c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1630008419985,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-e4be-dadb-a77e-f5be3b2c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-1a14-d164-adfa-ba7fec460003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000177-39fc-dd07-a17f-7dfc54d70003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000179-7b07-d2ba-a97f-7fefdb6e0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017b-8410-d5a5-a37f-867e00b90015&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017b-840f-d5a5-a37f-866ffe780000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>But, he said, things could be going better. &quot;There&#39;s a growing concern that our employees who interact with the public about not wearing a mask are being verbally, and sometimes, in some cases, physically assaulted, simply just for asking somebody to wear a mask.&quot; <br/><br/>Green said over the last year there have been 18 assaults against MBTA workers who asked a rider to wear a mask. <br/><br/>&quot;We recently witnessed one of our riders kick out one of our windows and verbally threaten the operator because she did not want to wear a mask,&quot; he said. &quot;This behavior is unacceptable and won&#39;t be tolerated.&quot; <br/><br/>In terms of ridership, MBTA General Manager Steve Poftak said they&#39;re expecting to see &quot;an incremental increase with probably an inflection point in early September,&quot; although he acknowledged a lot could change.<br/><br/>&quot;When people are ready to travel, when they need to travel, the MBTA is ready and it&#39;s safe,&quot; Poftak said.<br/><br/>In an effort to get more people to start riding the T again, officials announced that they&#39;re extending the pilot of the so-called &quot;Flex Pass,&quot; which is good for any five days of travel within a 30-day period. That test prgram was scheduled to expire Septemebr 15, but will now extend through March 15. And Poftak said a new schedule starting this Sunday will include some increases in service.<br/><br/>Poftak said commuter rail ridership continues to be far below it was before the pandemic. Between 30,000 and 32,000 people are riding the commuter rail each day, he said.<br/><br/>&quot;We believe that we have the right amount of service out there right now. We&#39;re only at about 25 to 30 percent of pre-COVID capacity,&quot; he said. &quot;That&#39;s something that we will track very carefully.

Article,How To Avoid The Next Afghanistan: Follow The U.S. Constitution,How To Avoid The Next Afghanistan: Follow The U.S. Constitution,"World War II was the last sustained military engagement from which the United States emerged undeniably victorious. And that was in September of 1945. Subsequent military actions — in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan ended in either stalemate or defeat. Think about it. The projection of force by the world&#39;s strongest military power has a 76-year record of failure. Some minor forays, such as Panama and Grenada, yielded positive results. But they were, in historical terms, inconsequential. What was not inconsequential was the humiliating failure in 1961 of the Bay of Pigs in Cuba. The Bay of Pigs forever cast a shadow on the brief presidency of John F. Kennedy and led, a year later, to the Cuban Missile Crisis, which itself brought the U.S. and Russia to the brink of nuclear war. <br/><br/>Why has the United States been so unsuccessful in its post-World War II efforts to wage war? This question becomes front-and-center in the wake of the mortifying scramble that is unfolding before the eyes of the world as President Joe Biden proceeds to withdraw U.S. forces, as well as many Afghans who had assisted our nation, from Afghanistan. <br/> <br/>When we take a step back to ask ourselves why and how the United States got into a war with such a disastrous ending, surely, we should look at Article I, section 8 of the Constitution — assigning Congress the power to declare war. Such a declaration would have signaled the importance of the conflict. If any one of the various presidents who prosecuted this war had sought a formal congressional declaration, it would have triggered the profound focus that a formal declaration engenders. <br/><br/>All of the commentary — from presidential news conferences to newspaper reporting to internet chatter — focuses on what we did wrong from a military strategic point of view. There seems to be no commentary, or at least none that I have been able to find, about the ways in which this massive failure can be laid at least partially at the doorstep of the failure of a number of presidents to seek a formal congressional declaration of war. <br/> <br/>I remember that when I was a young lawyer, students rebelled against the (undeclared) Vietnam War. That war became profoundly unpopular. I represented many young people who were indicted for failure to report for duty when they received a draft notice from the Selective Service System. Many students rioted on their respective college campuses: Columbia, Berkeley, Harvard and elsewhere. Without a formal declaration of war, the students’ opposition to the war seemed to have a certain legitimacy that the war effort did not. True, there were various indications that the Congress supported the president’s war effort in Vietnam — one recalls the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution that very few members of Congress opposed. But resolutions are not substitutes for a formal declaration of war — not only because of the constitutional requirement, but because a formal declaration psychologically, if not in other ways as well, is symbolic of the nation’s resolve. <br/> <br/>During the Vietnam War, my law partner at the time (Norman Zalkind) and I represented some 200 student rioters who took over University Hall at Harvard in a demonstration that caused Harvard’s then-president, Nathan Pusey, to call in the police to violently rout the students. Zalkind and I represented the students in court, where a jury of randomly selected members of the community acquitted them of trespass charges, despite the clear evidence of their having trespassed. The acquittal indicated just how unpopular that undeclared war had become. <br/> <br/>The lessons of history seem quite clear. If a war is sufficiently important, and the reasons for going to war sufficiently compelling, the President should be prepared to ask the Congress for a formal declaration. A declaration would mobilize the kind of national effort needed to prevail. And if the Congress refuses to enact a formal declaration, then the nation could be spared the kind of disaster currently unfolding in Afghanistan.<br/><br/><i>Harvey Silverglate, a regular GBH News contributor, is a criminal defense and civil liberties lawyer and writer.

She was 25. <br/><br/>The showing, with everyone from Gov. Charlie Baker to local veterans in attendance, was a testament to the impact Rosario&#39;s death has had on the community. <br/><br/>Lawrence Mayor Kendrys Vasquez told the crowd that her life served a higher purpose. <br/><br/>“To unite, to heal, to uplift and to bring hope to a world that seems falling and hopeless. That is the daughter, the friend, the community member that we lost, that we grieve today,” Vasquez said. “A friend who in the spirit of a true Lawrencian opened the doors and gave refuge who most needed at the time they needed it.”<br/><br/>Vasquez ended his remarks with a 13-second moment of silence in honor of Rosario Pichardo and the 12 other service members who were killed in the attack outside the Kabul airport where American soldiers and their Afghan allies were being evacuated.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1630460999976,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-fe91-d9b7-abe6-feb1834f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1630460999976,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-fe91-d9b7-abe6-feb1834f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017b-9680-d950-abfb-be8c7b7a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017b-82f9-d950-abfb-aafda9510000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017b-89e7-dde2-a77b-bde72fdd0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017b-9f0a-dde2-a77b-bf4fd08c000e&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017b-9f0a-dde2-a77b-bf4fce440000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/><br/>Baker remarked on how the world often seems to lose its brightest at an early age. <br/><br/>“When we see the sun rise and the sun set, and that full moon shine on this city and this Commonwealth, I hope you all take a moment and remember one of our brightest stars,” he said. <br/><br/>U.S. Rep. Lori Trahan said Rosario lived her life in service to others. <br/><br/>“Our community, our Commonwealth and our country recognize the tremendous debt that we can never fully repay to Johanny and her loved ones for their sacrifice,” she said. “But this community, Lawrence, Massachusetts, has shown time and time again how to support, how to love and how to heal. And Johanny needs us to do that for her family and her friends during this difficult time.”<br/><br/>Those in the crowd clutched American flags and lit candles, some of them singing along to the hymn “Amazing Grace” and “God Bless America.” Several times they chanted Rosario’s name, creating an echo across the stadium. <br/><br/>Among them was Joseph Feeley, 73, who served three years in the Army. He came out to remember a fallen comrade.<br/><br/>“It’s a sad occasion, of course, but I had to come because I knew other veterans that I know were gonna be here,” he said. “I’m from Carver, my post is in Plymouth, but I came up here to honor the young lady that died and honor her service and support her family.”<br/>",Esteban Bustillos,Tue Aug 31 21:55:18 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Brandman University brings to UMass Global annual operating revenue of about $130 million annually, plus about $50 million in cash.<br/><br/>A 13-member board of regents will govern UMass Global. Robert Manning, who chairs the UMass Board of Trustees, will chair the UMass Global Board of Regents, and additional members will be announced in the coming weeks, officials said.<br/><br/>UMass announced Wednesday that Manning, who also chairs MFS Investment Management, and his wife, Donna, agreed to make <a href=""https://statehousenews.com/news/20211632"" style=""color: rgb(0, 106, 199); text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-skip-ink: none;"">a $50 million gift</a> for the university system.<br/><br/>Based in Irvine, California, Brandman University today operates 25 physical campuses in California and Washington as well as hybrid and online models. It started in 1958 when Chapman College -- now Chapman University -- began offering on-base classes for active duty military personnel before evolving into an independent school within the Chapman University System.<br/><br/>When UMass first revealed the partnership last year, Chapman University President Daniele Struppa said it had become &quot;increasingly clear&quot; that Chapman&#39;s management of Brandman had gone &quot;as far as we can.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The time is right for Brandman&#39;s next step and UMass Global will undoubtedly be a national powerhouse in online education,&quot; Struppa said in a statement on Thursday. &quot;Finalizing the relationship between Brandman and UMass allows the two institutions to focus on their core strengths while Chapman continues its meteoric rise as a research institution.&quot;<br/><br/>Brandman&#39;s leadership will remain intact, and UMass Global intends to &quot;act with urgency to help reduce persistent educational and economic achievement gaps&quot; by expanding its student support model and its portfolio of business and nonprofit partnerships, officials said.<br/><br/>&quot;UMass Global will create a formidable offering at a time when working adults and underserved communities need better options to complete their educations,&quot; said Brandman University Chancellor Gary Brahm. &quot;By coming together, we will leverage each other&#39;s relationships, skills, and expertise to deliver leading hybrid and online academic programs from coast to coast.&quot;<br/><br/>The school currently provides services for employers that offer low- or no-cost college as a worker benefit, including Chipotle Mexican Grill, Target, Walmart, Disney, and Discover Financial Services. A UMass spokesperson said those commitments will continue to be honored under the new partnership model.<br/><br/>Last year, UMass also partnered with Mass General Brigham to launch a certificate and degree completion pathway for health care professionals.<br/><br/>The pandemic sparked renewed focus on workforce development and skills gaps in Massachusetts. After a wave of unemployment earlier in the crisis, many businesses have said they are struggling to find employees to fill in-demand jobs.<br/><br/>Gov. Charlie Baker has been urging the Legislature to spend hundreds of millions of dollars in American Rescue Plan Act funding on economic development and workforce training initiatives to help address those needs.<br/><br/>UMass and Brandman touted support for the new UMass Global affiliate from several major business groups including the Associated Industries of Massachusetts, the Los Angeles County Business Federation and the Massachusetts Business Roundtable.<br/><br/>&quot;Essential skills are one of the keys to unlocking economic opportunity for people and communities throughout Greater Boston and Massachusetts,&quot; Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce President James Rooney said in a statement provided by the schools. &quot;UMass Global is an innovative approach to re-skill and up-skill adult learners and workers, which will keep our region competitive as a global innovation leader.&quot;<br/>",Chris Lisinski | State House News Service,Thu Sep 02 17:19:30 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,"America's Afghan War Is Over, But Guantanamo Remains","America's Afghan War Is Over, But Guantanamo Remains","The headlines keep telling us that America’s longest war, the war fought in Afghanistan after 9/11, is over. <br/><br/>But the United States is still holding prisoners from that war, in an aging detention facility on the United States military base in Guantanamo Bay Cuba. <br/><br/>Over 700 men and some teenage boys were held in Guantanamo at its peak. Just under forty remain. At least nine have died at the prison. The vast majority of those who were held and released were never charged with any crime. <br/><br/>Mansoor Adayfi is one of those men. The former Guantanamo detainee from Yemen was sold to the U.S. by Afghan warlords, and spent 14 years in Guantanamo before the State Department under President Obama cleared him for release, flying him to Serbia for resettlement.<br/><br/>Ordinarily, that would be enough to set up the Q&amp;A we recorded about Mansoor’s new book, <i>Don’t Forget Us Here: Lost and Found at Guantanamo</i>.<br/><br/>But Mansoor and I have a complicated relationship.<br/><br/>In 2016 I was working <a href=""https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/out-of-gitmo/"">on a documentary about Guantanamo</a> for the GBH program Frontline, in collaboration with NPR. We spent some time with time with Mansoor in his new home in Belgrade. To keep an already long and complicated story short, Mansoor ended up getting roughed up and eventually detained for a time by secret police for talking with us. Mansoor became the focus of our documentary for Frontline, a case study in the difficulties faced by former prisoners as they try to reintegrate into an unfriendly world after a long stay in Gitmo.<br/><br/>We got deeply involved in his case. We got Mansoor a room to hide in after he was assaulted because of us. I ended up taking him to the hospital when he collapsed from his hunger strike, sitting by his bedside.<br/><br/>After we got back to the states, Mansoor called me when he found cameras and listening devices hidden throughout his government apartment, and began ripping them out of the walls. I was still on a video call with him when secret police armed with machine guns showed up and took him away (you can see this in the <a href=""https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/out-of-gitmo/""><b>Frontline doc</b></a>).<br/><br/>I disclose this not just because it’s interesting, but because I am a journalist hosting All Things Considered for GBH, but I can no longer interview Mansoor as a journalist.

And I wanted to write about, everyone, we&#39;re like brothers: guards, camps, even animals, lawyers… [to write] about Guantanamo itself, how it started, how it goes. Both, you know, the relationship between guards and detainees. So as I explained, we were not just the victims of Guantanamo; even guards, they were also victims. You know, that hardship, you know, brought us together and proves that we, we all are human. <br/><br/><b>Rath: </b><i>The title of your book </i>is Don&#39;t Forget Us Here<i>.

Personally, I didn&#39;t want to get my hopes up because something told me, this is not going to happen, and I told my brother— it was it was a huge topic of debate among us at that time. And we wished that he would win the election. So when 2010 came, we found out it&#39;s not going to be closed. So they relaxed the rules, and we tried to make the best of it, because we [were] so tired of being in solitary confinement, [of] hunger strikes and abuses for years and years.

Article,Watch Out For The Fin: Shark Tourism On Cape Cod Grows ,Watch Out For The Fin: Shark Tourism On Cape Cod Grows ,"CHATHAM, Mass. (AP) — There&#39;s no ominous music, no telltale fin breaking the surface as the powerful silhouette of a great white shark glides alongside the small tour boat off Cape Cod in Massachusetts.<br/>Michael Simard crouches low and points a finger in the direction of the roughly 10-foot (3-meter) predator cruising in the glassy water below.<br/><br/>The 48-year-old construction foreman from Cambridge, Massachusetts, glances back at his partner, Penny Antonoglou, who dutifully pulls out her smartphone while he holds the pose. Smile. Click.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#39;s awe-inspiring, really,&quot; Simard said after the tour, where they spotted at least six great whites. &quot;I didn&#39;t realize how graceful they were. It does put it into perspective that this is their element, and we just share it with them.&quot;<br/><br/>Three summers after Cape Cod saw two great white shark attacks on humans — including the state&#39;s first fatal attack since 1936 — the popular tourist destination south of Boston is showing signs it&#39;s slowly, tentatively embracing its shark-y reputation.<br/><br/>A small but growing group of charter boat operators are offering great white shark tours in a region where whale and seal watching excursions have long been a tourist rite of passage.<br/><br/>The Atlantic White Shark Conservancy, a prominent nonprofit shark research organization, is among those that have jumped into the shark ecotourism game. It&#39;s also renovated its Shark Center, a family-friendly museum showcasing its research into the local shark population, and is building another educational outpost set to open next summer in the bustling tourist center of Provincetown.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, local shark-themed merchandisers are reporting brisk businesses, even as the coronavirus pandemic has disrupted parts of the region&#39;s tourism industry. Cape Cod hosts about 4 million visitors a year, who bring in more than $1 billion in tourism spending and support thousands of jobs.<br/><br/>&quot;It feels like we&#39;re on the trajectory of it being a point of pride for Cape Cod,&quot; said Patrick Clarke, owner of the jewelry company Cape Clasp, of the region&#39;s white sharks. &quot;A lot of the initial fear and hysteria was the fear of the unknown, but we&#39;re learning more and more about them every year.&quot;<br/><br/>Clarke makes a range of jewelry featuring whales, turtles and other marine life, but says the shark-themed pieces — specifically a bracelet made from marine-grade cord held together by a great white shark-shaped sterling silver clasp — are consistently his top sellers.<br/>In Chatham, a hub of the local shark tourism industry, a company that started selling popular stickers of Cape Cod in the shape of a great white shark some seven years ago has taken off as the local shark population has also come into its own. <br/><br/>Kristina Manter says Cape Shark, the apparel company she co-owns with her boyfriend, opened a brick-and-mortar storefront on Main Street last summer to sell a range of hoodies, sweatpants, T-shirts and other clothing adorned with the logo. <br/><br/>&quot;We&#39;re not just popping up because we saw the tourism. We&#39;ve been around because we&#39;ve loved the sharks and believed in their conservation,&quot; Manter says. &quot;It just kind of fell together perfectly.&quot;<br/><br/>There&#39;s no definitive tally for how much shark-related tourism contributes to the roughly 65-mile (105-kilometer) peninsula&#39;s economy, but its growth is helping stretch the tourist season into the fall, as peak shark sightings happen in August and September, says Paul Niedzwiecki, CEO of the Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce.<br/><br/>Indeed, dozens of beaches have temporarily closed in recent weeks after sharks were spotted as close as 30 feet (9 meters)  from some of the Cape&#39;s most famous stretches of sand. Shark researchers say they expect to be out tagging and observing the predators into November, if the weather permits.<br/><br/>&quot;Several years ago, there was a concern that it might have a negative impact on tourism,&quot; Niedzwiecki said. &quot;But we&#39;ve been working to educate people about sharks and what we&#39;ve actually seen is no negative impact.&quot;<br/><br/>Mike Bosley, who captained the shark tour Simard and Antonoglou took last month, hopes shark watching tours can bring a different perspective to the local shark discourse.<br/><br/>&quot;There&#39;s always been sharks, but there hasn&#39;t always been the opportunity to interact with sharks in this fashion,&quot; said Bosley, whose Dragonfly Sportfishing started offering shark tours in earnest this summer in between its regular fishing and whale watching excursions. &quot;They&#39;re part of our ecosystem.&quot;<br/><br/>Since the 2018 attacks, Cape officials have invested in better training and equipment for lifeguards and first responders to keep beachgoers safe as great white sharks migrate in ever larger numbers to feast on the region&#39;s bountiful seal population.<br/><br/>But a group of concerned residents, vacationers and other advocates have formed a nonprofit to push for more sophisticated and proactive shark safety measures, such as undersea detection, land-based warning systems and drone surveillance.<br/><br/>Local surfers, meanwhile, have taken to arming themselves  with shark repellents, including personal devices that emit electrical fields that supposedly deter but don&#39;t harm sharks.<br/><br/>Concern about great whites is growing elsewhere in New England, especially after a New York woman was fatally bitten by one in Maine last July, becoming the first person to die by shark attack in the state. Dozens of marine organizations and state agencies from Rhode Island to Canada formed a consortium to collaborate on shark research in response.<br/><br/>Greg Skomal, a state marine biologist currently studying the hunting patterns of the Cape&#39;s great whites, says shark tours could prove beneficial, so long as they continue to be done responsibly.<br/><br/>There are currently no licensing or registration requirements for the tours, but those and other regulations should be considered if more join the fray, he said.<br/><br/>The state banned  the use of bloody chum, decoys and other bait to lure sharks in 2015, meaning the kinds of shark cage diving operations that are common in Australia, South Africa and other shark-rich destinations aren&#39;t allowed in Massachusetts waters, unless they&#39;re more than 3 miles (5 kilometers) offshore, where state jurisdiction ends.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#39;re very sensitive to activities that alter the sharks&#39; natural behavior,&quot; said Skomal. &quot;We don&#39;t want six (tours) following a single shark into shallow water near swimming beaches.&quot;<br/><br/>Like most operations, Bosley&#39;s Dragonfly Sportfishing generally stays hundreds of yards (meters) off shore, in water more than 8 feet (2.4 meters) deep.<br/><br/>But it&#39;s a relatively costly outing: The nearly three-hour tours, which rely on an overhead &quot;spotter&quot; plane to locate sharks, range anywhere from $1,600 to $2,500 per boat, and the vessels typically carry six passengers at most.<br/><br/>Antonoglou, a 47-year-old civil engineer, says the eye-opening experience is worth the expense.<br/><br/>&quot;When people think of great whites, they think of &#39;Jaws,&#39; but it&#39;s not like that at all,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#39;s pretty cool that we know they&#39;re out there. The populations are thriving, and I think it&#39;s a great asset for the Cape.&quot;<br/>",Philip Marcelo | Associated Press,Tue Sep 07 10:30:01 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,"Top Base Official Worried About Environmental Review Of Cape Cod Machine Gun Range, Emails Show","Top Base Official Worried About Environmental Review Of Cape Cod Machine Gun Range, Emails Show","In an email to congressional staffers, a top officer on Joint Base Cape Cod expressed fears that a more intensive environmental review would defeat long-sought plans to build a machine gun range on the base.<br/><br/>That email and about 100 others released Tuesday reveal escalating tensions between Gen.

Opponents also worry that it would be located over the sole drinking water source for Upper Cape towns. Concerns raised in public meetings range from groundwater contamination, to traffic, to noise.<br/><br/><b>Emails Show an Escalation of Tensions</b><br/><bsp-raw-html html=""&lt;iframe src=\&quot;https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1IUzvG-TYn6RStJvuSno0qiZwzllQsMTq\/preview\&quot; width=100% height=350 allow=\&quot;autoplay\&quot;&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;"">Raw Html</bsp-raw-html><br/>In a March 24, 2021, email from Faux to Keating staffers, the general said the machine gun range could not sustain the scrutiny of a more intensive environmental review, and if such a review were required, the guard “will most likely lose the project and its funding.”<br/><br/>“Honestly, just the phrase ‘further NEPA [National Environmental Policy Act] review or EIS [Environmental Impact Statement] coming from the [congressional] delegation will sink this project and dramatically impact the MA National Guard,” Faux wrote in the email to Ryan Maddock and Andrew Nelson, two Keating aides.<br/><br/>That email came eight days after <a href=""https://www.capeandislands.org/local-news/2021-03-16/rep-keating-calls-for-closer-look-at-proposed-machine-gun-range"" target=""_blank"">WCAI published a story revealing that Keating had called for more oversight </a>to be applied to the Massachusetts Army National Guard’s proposal to build the range. “We’re going to see if we can request something that perhaps can have greater scrutiny,” Keating said at the time.<br/><br/>In an email to Faux, Jake McCumber, Natural Resources Director at the Base, called himself a “scattered ball of frustrated energy after reading” Keating’s statement. Col. Matthew Porter, base commander for Camp Edwards, suggested that Faux read the story when he was sitting down. “I think we just got hosed!” Porter wrote.<br/><br/>The next day, Faux emailed Keating’s two staffers, saying he assumed the congressman was simply “promising his constituents a ‘due-diligence’ look at a project we have already discussed in great detail.”<br/><br/>After seven days without a documented response, Faux emailed again, repeating his and his colleagues’ long-held position: the range is a good and important project for the base.<br/><br/>“I could go on and on how this project represents an overall positive impact to the environment (copper bullets not affecting ground water, mitigation that improves habitat, species and eventual carbon sequestration … which equates to positive impacts on climate shift), but it falls on deaf ears in the small fraction of citizens that represent the activists,” he wrote.<br/><br/>Faux went on to claim that those activists had failed to identify any specific errors or omissions in the Guard’s analysis of the project, and that range opponents were relying on delay tactics.<br/><br/>“We are more than happy to field the questions posed by the groups that include the Cape Cod Democratic Socialists and others representing the extreme left,” he wrote. However, he urged Keating to ask those groups to provide specific examples of alleged falsehoods in the Guard’s analysis, “not just the ultra-generalized statement requesting further analysis.”<br/><br/><b>&quot;You have deliberately deceived me.&quot;</b><br/><br/>Two days later, on March 26, still without a documented response from Keating’s office, Faux emailed again, saying the “sheer lack of communication,” led him to believe the congressman had shifted his support “towards the vocal minority.”<br/><br/>“We’ve heard from multiple agencies and viewed numerous articles stating the Congress [sic] Keating is engaging Senators Warren and Markey to request further NEPA review in the form of an Environmental Impact Statement,” he wrote.<br/><br/>“If that is the case, we will most likely lose the project and its funding and will have wasted ten years of work, thousands of hours in preparation of an irrefutable, fact-based assessment that meticulously followed the codified NEPA process and will significantly impact the readiness of not only the MA Guard, but of the United States Army as a whole.”<br/><br/>By then, the Guard had already produced an Environmental Assessment that took into account the need for the 10-lane range, alternatives to the project, and impacts to groundwater, habitat, and local animal and insect species. That document, produced by Guard staff and reviewed by federal officials, resulted in a finding that the environmental impacts of the range would create “No Significant Impact.”” A full Environmental Impact Statement, a process that triggers a more comprehensive review, would have been required if the Guard’s assessment had found a potentially significant impact.<br/><br/>“It boggles my mind,” Faux concluded, “that in a district with more than 50,000 registered veterans … not including those still in uniform … that the feelings of several hundred could carry so much weight.”<br/><br/>In the weeks that followed, Keating and Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey formally asked the National Guard Bureau to consider requiring the Massachusetts Army National Guard to produce a full Environmental Impact Statement.<br/><br/>&quot;On behalf of our constituents, we respectfully request that you determine whether a full Environmental Impact Statement is warranted,” the lawmakers said in a letter, “and that you include consideration of stakeholder input from both abutters and those who rely on water from Cape Cod’s sole source aquifer.&quot;<br/><br/>On April 12, still without any response from Keating’s office, Faux sent an email to Keating staffers saying he had learned of the letter. Subject line: “appalled.”<br/><br/>“I guess this explains why my emails have been ignored for the past few weeks,” he began. “It’s pretty obvious that you have deliberately deceived me and my colleagues and created a false sense of trust.”<br/><br/>He expressed shock that the congressional delegation members would “abandon” the Guard in favor of a “small group of activists that manipulate facts to perpetuate their own anti-military agendas.”<br/><br/>He concluded by asking for a new point of contact for Keating’s Washington, D.C., and Cape offices.<br/><br/>“In my 34+ years I have dedicated to country and Commonwealth,” Faux wrote, “I have never had to worry about a trusting relationship with ANY staffer from either side of the aisle … until now!”<br/><br/>On Tuesday, Keating’s chief of staff denied accusations of deception, and wrote in an email that the congressman’s top priority is transparency about the Guard’s plan for the range.<br/><br/>Andrew Gottlieb, executive director of the Association to Preserve Cape Cod, said the email in which Faux expressed fear of greater scrutiny is deeply revealing.<br/><br/>“It’s an admission that the internally run Environmental Assessment was inadequate ... and it’s the clarity we needed to show that this whole analysis was rigged to achieve an outcome that would avoid further independent third-party review of the project,” he said.<br/><br/><b>Questions of Transparency Not Helped by Missing Emails</b><br/><br/>In an email, Guard officials said the failure to release the emails sooner was caused by technical problems. Specifically, they said, their search for communications from Faux about the range picked up emails sent on desktops, but not from other devices.<br/><br/>“Upon receiving an appeal, in order to be thorough and ensure we produced all responsive records, we ran an additional search of General Faux’s emails through the federal email system,” wrote Timothy F. Cullen, legislative liaison for the Massachusetts National Guard. “This search yielded additional responsive records that were not previously found in our original search.”<br/><br/>But David Cuillier, president of the National Freedom of Information Coalition and an expert on public records requests filed under the Freedom of Information Act, says that shouldn’t happen.<br/><br/>“They should come up with better systems for easy retrieval of documents,” he said. “We&#39;re in the year 2021 now. It shouldn&#39;t be that foreign or strange to come up with computer systems that can do this.”<br/><br/>Gottlieb was not convinced either.<br/><br/>“Email records are a pretty easy thing to archive, save and recover. It astonishes me that an organization as organized and disciplined as the military didn’t have a systematic way to ensure a simple records request that was narrow and specific could be fulfilled without having to ask a second time, and then having to ask a third time in an appeal to a higher authority in order for this to suddenly be discovered,” he said. ”This should be troubling to anyone who cares about integrity.”<br/><br/>Gottlieb filed for public release of Faux’s emails twice, and said he appealed last week because he was concerned by past threats Faux made to Cape Cod businesses.<br/><br/>In a June email to the Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce, <a href=""https://www.capeandislands.org/podcast/the-point/2021-06-11/news-roundup-steamship-woes-continue-guard-letter-over-gun-range-provokes-furor"" target=""_blank"">Faux threatened to keep military men and women away </a>from local businesses unless the business community expressed support for the range. He also told the Chamber that he might recommend soldiers travel off the Cape to purchase goods and services.<br/><br/>In light of the newly released emails, Gottlieb said he would call on Gov. Charlie Baker, who oversees the Massachusetts National Guard, to order the Guard to shelve the machine gun range.<br/><br/>“The governor has no other choice if he wishes to restore faith in the integrity of the public process under his administration,” Gottlieb said.<br/><br/>Earlier this summer,<a href=""https://www.capeandislands.org/local-news/2021-07-23/baker-expresses-environmental-safety-concerns-about-proposed-machine-gun-range"" target=""_blank""> Baker said he had questions</a> about environmental and safety concerns around the project, questions also raised by range opponents.<br/>",Eve Zuckoff,Wed Sep 08 10:40:19 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As you wait for your plane and walk through the entrance ramp, there’s nothing at all to let you know that you’re retracing the steps of the terrorists and some of their victims.<br/><br/>The only markers are outside. An American flag sits atop the end of each gate. The flags are on short poles, and easy to miss. It’s almost impossible to notice that they are the only gates in the airport with this understated decoration.<br/><br/>Logan International Airport features as a key thruway on the <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/2017/12/06/news/sixteen-years-after-911-attacks-pretrial-hearings-continue-accused"">extensive evidence trail</a> developed by the military commissions trying the five men accused of plotting the 9/11 attacks. At a 2017 hearing, I heard FBI witnesses testify that lead hijacker <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/2017/12/07/news/guantanamo-bay-update-911-pre-trial-hearings"">Mohammed Atta’s checked bag</a> didn’t make his flight. We saw photos of the luggage, and the tags and other documents with those gate numbers on them. <br/><br/>I’ve never visited the 9/11 memorial at Logan, but since that hearing, every time I’m there, I try to get a glimpse of either gate. It’s almost ritualistic, having to lay eyes on them, like one might try to locate an out-of-the-way shrine. <br/><br/>I was working for WNYC, New York’s local NPR, on the day of the attacks. We got knocked out of our offices, just blocks away from the twin towers, for a couple of weeks. Returning to the office meant daily walks past the pile of rubble that burned for months. <br/><br/>Some wanted to re-build the towers exactly as they were, just 10 feet taller, a show of strength or defiance. The first time that I saw the flag on the C-19 gate, I was a little angry. It felt weak and forgettable, nondescript. If you weren’t looking for it, you surely wouldn’t see it — we see flags all over the place. But I can’t judge the airlines or the port authority; I don’t have any better idea of what to do. <br/><br/>When I go to lower Manhattan now, even though it’s somewhere I lived and worked for so long, I don’t recognize it. I find trips back to Ground Zero unnerving. It’s not precisely reassuring that Logan’s gates are unchanged, but it offers something, at least, kept frozen in time to recall that day. <br/><br/>In the wake of the attacks, it quickly came out that all 19 terrorists were brown men, and as a brown man, for a moment, I was scared of being targeted. Just as quickly, I realized there was no place I’d rather be than New York City at that moment. There were vigils, strangers would hug and cry together. My white neighbors in Brooklyn would go out of their way to make eye contact and smile at me. We weren’t just okay, we were better, stronger, unified. <br/><br/>Going to the prison at Guantanamo Bay has shown me just the opposite. I’ve been to the base close to 10 times over the last decade. I’ve seen Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the ‘mastermind’ who came up the plan to hijack planes with boxcutters and fly them into buildings, and had briefer glimpses of the hundreds of others being held who were never charged with any crime. We learned in some detail about the abuse of the 9/11 defendants, the waterboarding and worse. We learned that one of the defendants sat on a pillow because of the damage he’d suffered from brutal sexual abuse at the hands of the CIA. <br/><br/>There’s no doubt that Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and his crew were evil. But what I came to feel, deep in my bones, on those trips to “Camp Justice,” was how successful the attacks had been. They had brought out evil in us. And it was there in front of me in brick and stone and barbed wire, next to a beautiful beach in the Caribbean. <br/><br/>We started out with unity, and it breaks my heart that this is what remains: a forever prison, and a forever war. And two lonely flags at Logan. <br/><bsp-raw-html html=""&lt;div style=\&quot;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25% ; height: 0;\&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;iframe style=\&#39;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0;\&#39; id=\&#39;partnerPlayer\&#39; frameborder=\&#39;0\&#39; marginwidth=\&#39;0\&#39; marginheight=\&#39;0\&#39; scrolling=\&#39;no\&#39; width=\&#39;100%\&#39; height=\&#39;100%\&#39; src=\&#39;https:\/\/player.pbs.org\/partnerplayer\/7aQXa7IBgMWq0uTwgtZbjg==\/?start=0&amp;end=0&amp;topbar=false&amp;autoplay=false&amp;endscreen=false\&#39; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;\r\n&lt;\/div&gt;"">Raw Html</bsp-raw-html>",Arun Rath,Thu Sep 09 16:08:28 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,9/11 Has Left A Huge Security Footprint On The Boston Landscape,9/11 Has Left A Huge Security Footprint On The Boston Landscape,"Linda Brown can’t tell you what she had for lunch yesterday, but the events of the Tuesday, Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks are ingrained in her mind, from the moment she stepped out of the shower at 9:03 a.m. <br/><br/>“When I turned on the news, I actually saw the second plane hit the second tower,” she said, believing then that a fighter jet had accidentally hit the World Trade Center. &quot;Then the camera panned out to show the first tower smoking, and I knew something terrible had happened... it&#39;s just one of those things you never forget in your life.&quot;<br/><br/>Brown was then a senior Inspector with the U.S. Customs Service at Logan Airport. When she got to work, she found grounded flights and only military planes occasionally patrolling overhead. “There is nothing eerier than walking out onto a busy airport and not having any noise, no flights arriving, no flights taking off, no hustle and bustle around,” she told GBH News<br/><br/>The two American Airlines and United Airlines planes that crashed into the trade center towers were hijacked after flying out of Logan Airport. What happened that day would not only change our experience with air travel, but lead to a metamorphosis in how America secured its public spaces.<br/><br/><b>Airport Security Overhaul</b><br/><br/>In 2001, there was very little security to speak of at the airport, according to Brown and other experts. Friends and family could walk right up to a gate without being screened. There was no Customs and Border Protection, let alone a whole Department of Homeland Security agency.<br/><br/>“My biggest concern [pre-9/11] was ensuring that drug smugglers didn&#39;t bring drugs across the border. Our number one priority now is ensuring that terrorists don&#39;t enter our country,” said Brown, who is currently Boston port director for Customs and Border Protection. “And we&#39;ve made huge strides in doing that.”<br/><br/>Then-president George W. Bush signed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act in November 2001 requiring screening be conducted by federal officials, initiating the birth of the Transportation Security Administration. Now, TSA agents have a large presence in every airport.<br/><br/>Because of 9/11 and the December 2001 shoe-bombing attempt by Richard Reid, TSA requires explosive detection systems nationwide, and requires shoes go through X-ray machines.<br/><br/>The passage of the Homeland Security Act by Congress launched the creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2003, fusing the U.S. Customs Service, Immigration and Naturalization Service, and other agencies covering agriculture, security, and communications.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1631297991264,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-fe91-d9b7-abe6-feb1834f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1631297991264,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-fe91-d9b7-abe6-feb1834f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017b-cf26-de67-ab7f-df7698ae0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017b-c4da-d6e2-ab7b-fdfb008d0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-f336-d663-a3fa-ff77fb000002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017b-d0eb-dc75-a1ff-d1fb0b08001f&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017b-d0eb-dc75-a1ff-d1fb08b50000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>“Organized crime and white-collar crime was really a focus of some federal investigations, and then all of a sudden terrorism was really, really brought to the forefront,” said Richard Donohue, a policy researcher at RAND Corporation’s Boston office. There was a shift in personnel training, how much money was being allocated to counter terrorism, intelligence, and technology.<br/><br/>At Logan Airport, there are five 3-D imaging machines at check-points and 30 CT machines to check baggage. Patrons walk through 21 full body scanners, raising their arms so the technology can detect nonmetallic weapons or explosives that can be concealed under layers of clothing.<br/><br/>Eleven canine teams trained in San Antonio patrol Logan, with the job of sniffing out explosives.<br/><br/>And the psychology of how people enter the U.S. has changed. Now, said Brown, customs officers have to ask themselves questions like “Is this person standing here coming to the U.S. for the reason that they state they’re coming? Are they really here for school or for a business meeting? What’s the real reason they’re coming?”’<br/><br/>The future of Logan Airport security may involve facial recognition technology, fingerprint and eye scanners, as a part of a controversial pilot program being implemented around the country in the next five years. <br/><br/>“We know we have to stay ahead of the threat. So, the funding will be there for us if and when we need it,” said Daniel Velez, spokesperson for TSA’s New England region. <br/><br/>But that system raises concerns over civil rights violations and is already the subject of <a href=""https://www.aclu.org/cases/aclu-v-dhs-foia-lawsuit-seeking-information-implementation-face-surveillance-airports"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>a lawsuit</u></a> from the American Civil Liberties Union. <br/><br/>MassPort, which owns and operates Logan Airport, declined to comment on this story, citing respect for the families impacted by the 9/11 attacks.<br/><br/><b>Regional Cooperation and Communication</b><br/><br/>Another thing that didn’t exist pre-9/11, according to national security experts, was cohesive communication and analysis.<br/><br/>“That was one of the big problems previously. Right? The three-lettered agencies didn&#39;t speak to each other enough,” said Brown. “I think we at CBP learned that lesson, we make sure that we share our information with whoever wants to listen.”<br/><br/>The Boston Regional Intelligence Center, or BRIC, was created in 2005 to share information between many agencies, from the Boston Police Department where it’s housed, to the FBI, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and CBP. <br/><br/>The organization, individual task forces, and police departments all share intelligence and perform counter terrorism trainings for staff, including how law enforcement should handle active shooter trainings or a terrorist event at a stadium, and how first responders should deal with those scenarios.<br/><br/>There are over 200 regional task forces that use technology and old school policing to assess domestic and international terrorism, and share with partners in law enforcement.<br/><br/>Joe Bonavolonta, special agent in charge of the FBI Boston division, was working in 2001 in New York City next to the World Trade Center, focused on busting Italian crime syndicates. <br/><br/>“It [cooperation] really has created a mechanism for us to effectively and efficiently use all the tools, whether it be in the local, state or federal tool kit, to try to get out ahead of these terrorism threats,” Bonavolonta said. “Right now, the FBI is heavily focused at people with easy access to weapons who are radicalized online and inspired by the global jihadist movement.’”<br/><br/>He pointed to several prominent investigations operated out of Boston, including the arrest and conviction of the Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, and the arrest and conviction of Tarek Mehanna, who provided material support to Al-Qaeda.<br/><br/>Chris Delmonte is the Chief of Police for the Bridgewater Police Department and heads the Southeastern Massachusetts Law Enforcement Council. For police chiefs like him, the greatest investments in security post 9/11 come from better training, and equipment sharing.<br/><br/>“We worked to secure a mobile command vehicle, and that&#39;s a resource that many individual communities couldn’t afford or operate on their own,” he said. <br/><br/>“Even when we talk about our individual communities, being a part of something bigger and greater and more collaborative has been a benefit even to all,” Delmonte said. <br/><br/><b>Cameras Take Over</b><br/><br/>Cameras are quiet sentinels in office lobbies, restaurants, airports, manufacturing sites, and many roads, a quiet reminder of how security has hardened since 9/11.<br/><br/>“If you walk around downtown Boston and look around, you&#39;re going to see a lot of cameras on the outside of buildings. You&#39;re going to see a lot of cameras inside of buildings. And there&#39;s quite a few of them that have our logo on them,” said James Marcella of Axis Communications, an international video surveillance manufacturer with a Chelmsford office.<br/><br/>While he wouldn’t disclose specific clients, a GBH contract search found MassDOT and Mass General Hospital, among others, are Axis Communications customers.<br/><br/>Video is used to record activities in private and public spaces, and can be used by law enforcement to review and react, said Marcella. The technology has transitioned from analog in the early 2000s to digital, with alerts for more preventative measures, like people loitering in one spot too long. Image quality has been boosted from low resolution to high megapixels.<br/><br/>The 2013 Boston Marathon Bombing, he said, is an example of how video surveillance was and can be used to track down perpetrators, with tape from stores and businesses along the marathon route.<br/><br/>Just within the MBTA transportation system there are more than <a href=""http://www.winstedcustom.com/resources/references/mbta/"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>10,000 cameras</u></a>. Donohue from RAND said the camera system is one of the largest in the country, and has been funded repeatedly through the Department of Homeland Security. In fact, money from the annual Homeland Security Grant Program is often what helps state, local governments, nonprofit agencies and private sector companies pay for surveillance.<br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1631299165183,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-fe91-d9b7-abe6-feb1834f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1631299165183,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-fe91-d9b7-abe6-feb1834f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017b-d0fe-dbf8-a1ff-d0fee9a30001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017b-d0fe-de67-ab7f-dafed18f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017b-d0fe-de67-ab7f-dafed16d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">City hall.jpg</bsp-image><br/><br/><b>Designing Your Way To Safety</b><br/><br/>Security can also come in the form of urban planning and architecture. Design firm Utile Architecture &amp; Planning created a master plan for City Hall and its plaza four years ago aiming to boost security while keeping the area appealing to visitors and employees. <br/><br/>Entering City Hall, &quot;which was meant to be a kind of effortless kind of flow from outside to inside and up, had to get rethought with security checkpoints and a whole level of apparatus that ended up taking away from the drama of walking into the building,” said Tim Love, principal at the firm and a board member of the Boston Society for Architecture.<br/><br/>Scanners, a conveyer belt, and an information stand were added. Staff and visitors now come in through separate entrances to reduce time in line. A new coffee shop exists to keep visitors happy after their security ordeal, or as they wait for others to pass through the scanners. According to the<a href=""https://www.boston.gov/news/mayor-walsh-unveils-newly-renovated-city-hall-lobby"" style=""text-decoration:none;""> <u>City of Boston</u></a>, lobby changes cost $2.1 million.<br/><br/>Commissioner Bill Evans led the Boston Police Department from January 2014 to August 2018, serving immediately after the Boston Marathon Bombings. He’s now head of security for Boston College. Part of boosting security after 9/11, when he was a captain on the force and his brother Paul was commissioner, was thinking outside of the box, he said. “We tried to identify and put ourselves in the position of what would be an attractive target for terrorists who really want to make an impact.” <br/><br/>That included adding fences, gates, and cameras around TD Garden, chemical plants, Fenway Park, and gas tanks in Dorchester. <br/><br/>‘“I remember right away doing a lot of outreach [post 9/11] to all those companies and saying, “I&#39;ll identify your weaknesses and how we are going to strengthen them. So, you know, we&#39;re watching everyone in and around your premises,”’ said Evans.<br/><br/>Another example of redesigning for security is the renovation of the<a href=""https://www.architects.org/stories/no-reservations"" style=""text-decoration:none;""> <u>Federal Reserve Bank</u></a> building by Halvorson Design Partnership after 9/11.<br/><br/>There is no gap greater than four feet around the building’s perimeter, in order to prevent vehicles from crashing into the building. Bollards create a kind of plaza within a plaza and a concrete raised grass bed creates another barrier, while also providing seating for the public. <br/><br/>“Decisions that were made about the site planning for that project were really a careful assessment about how to protect a federal building, not only because of 9/11, but because of the Oklahoma City bombing and the general vulnerability of federal buildings to terrorist attacks,” said Love. <br/><br/><b>Infrastructure Changes You Don’t See</b><br/><br/>There have also been vast security and infrastructure changes that are invisible to civilians.<br/><br/>For example, the National Nuclear Security Administration, NNSA, is part of the Department of Energy, and works to secure radiological materials for use, storage, and disposal. Blood banks, hospitals, research universities, and construction sites can all use those substances for manufacturing, research, and <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4783265/"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>ultraviolet</u></a> blood <a href=""https://nonproliferation.org/alternatives-to-high-risk-radiological-sources/"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>therapies</u></a>. <br/><br/>Emily Adams manages NNSA projects around the U.S., and said in the Boston area alone, they enhanced security at 41 buildings that contain high-activity radiological material, and are working on four more. The organization has also removed and replaced 11 devices that use radiological material in the area.<br/><br/>Over 300 area law enforcement officials have been trained by the NNSA. Training happens weekly on radiological fundamentals, including fictional scenarios involving the use of stolen materials in a dirty bomb attack.<br/><br/>“We&#39;ve also partnered with the local law enforcement agencies across the Boston area to develop policies and training programs to assist in an effective response should the theft of radioactive material take place,” said Adams. <br/><br/><i><b>Correction:</b> This story has been updated to correct the attribution of comments from James Marcella of Axis Communications.

Article,State To Roll Out Teacher Registry To Improve Tracking Of Credentials,State To Roll Out Teacher Registry To Improve Tracking Of Credentials,"Teachers and those who seek to become educators may soon see a shift in how Massachusetts credentials its educators and tracks those requirements through a new registry. <br/><br/>The Board of Early Education and Care (EEC) met Tuesday to discuss how it could relax some of the early education teacher credentialing policies to increase the pipeline of people willing to take jobs in daycares and after-school programs. <br/><br/>Part of that solution is an online registry that Commissioner Samantha Aigner-Treworgy called “a hub for our educator information,” intending to streamline how potential and current educators upload, share and store credentialing information, with the ability for the state to conduct analytics on those and where successes and pitfalls lie. <br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1631662353656,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000168-2a01-dff6-a1ef-fabd12060000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1631662353656,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000168-2a01-dff6-a1ef-fabd12060000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017b-5f95-ddb1-abfb-df97c9be0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017b-dbf3-d264-ab7f-dbf3be1b0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000177-d540-dbe7-ad77-fdcf6ec00003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017b-e6a5-d00c-ab7f-eff798d2000d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017b-e6a5-d00c-ab7f-eff798a40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>“We will be building a professional registry that will allow educators and our programs to help upload that information in a much more real time way,” she said. <br/><br/>The board on Aug. 31 voted to give Aigner-Treworgy authority to adjust early education teacher credentialing policy in an effort to get more applicants. <br/><br/>Recruiting early education teachers is impacting capacity and quality of EEC facilities, according to a May 2021 survey of 35 EEC center directors by the nonprofit Neighborhood Villages. Less than 25% of candidates reviewed are qualified for open roles. Those that do make the cut often reject offers for high-paying roles elsewhere. This staffing shortage decreases classroom hours available to families. <br/><br/>“We have indeed a workforce crisis, we have a shortage, but we also have the long overdue opportunities for real innovation to both support today&#39;s dedicated and resilient workforce while bringing others into this fabulous field,” said EEC Board Chair Nonie Lesaux. <br/><br/>While she didn’t go into detail on what major adjustments will occur to early child education credentials, Aigner-Treworgy said those “policies and operational flexibilities” would be forthcoming in the next few weeks. <br/><br/>She said the state will be releasing a policy that will include additional credentials educators can submit to be considered for licensure. While the list of potential credentials will be longer and offer more elasticity to documents people can submit, Aigner-Treworgy said it will not reduce qualifications. The list of new documents has not been released. <br/><br/>She said the board had heard public comments on people wishing there would be improvements on DESE licensure, including the inclusion of “coursework that may not be traditional EEC course of study.” <br/><br/>Trying to find alternative routes to “document that competency” to teach is something that’s at the forefront of the board’s efforts, said Aigner-Treworgy.<br/><br/>The platform will be accessible to educators, people applying for certifications and the state. <br/><br/>“Over the course of the year, we&#39;ll be using that to launch and support a background integration, training and professional development,” she said. The registry will be rolled out in three stages through early 2022. ",Sarah Betancourt,Tue Sep 14 19:36:53 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a statement Monday, it said the decision was made “following a Federal Register public comment period, and after careful consideration of the unique operational and geographic challenges highlighted through the comments.”<br/><br/>U.S. Representative Bill Keating, whose district is partially served by the Scituate station, told GBH News he is pleased that it will remain open.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1633377285559,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1633377285559,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000171-187a-d34a-a9fb-3c7ad9f80003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-3780-d887-adfb-779abd350000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017c-4c9f-dcca-a1fe-4ddf00000020&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017c-4c9e-dcca-a1fe-4ddffd990000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module>“This will be a long-term decision,” Keating said. “Rear Admiral [Thomas] Allan assured me that this will be long term and we won&#39;t have to worry about this season to season.”<br/><br/>Keating said, after learning of the agency’s plan to close the station this summer, a joint group of harbormasters, local and state leaders got together and requested an extended comment period on the issue. <br/><br/>They appealed to the U.S. Coast Guard to keep the station open because it serves the busy waters off the South Shore. If the Scituate station were to close, Keating said emergency response times would fall far short of what is needed for boating and fishing safety and it could increase a security risk after the decommissioning of the Plymouth Nuclear Power Plant.<br/><br/>“There are over 6,000 moorings from Hull to Plymouth,” Boudreau said. “So any response time increases, in that area, we were afraid, would have fatal consequences. So that was really the genesis for the efforts to keep it open.”<br/><br/>Scituate Harbor Master Stephen Mone said he is “happy with the decision.”<br/><br/>“Moving a boat from Scituate to Point Allerton in Hull in four-foot seas would take that boat 78 minutes to get from Hull to Scituate, 78 minutes to get some help,” Boudreau said. “And [in] any incident on the water, seconds count.”<br/><br/>The station is set to re-open for seasonal operations over Memorial Day weekend in 2022.

Article,Indigenous Peoples' March Calls For Statewide Observance Of Holiday,Indigenous Peoples' March Calls For Statewide Observance Of Holiday,"By Taylor Blackley and Elena Giardina<br/><br/>Activists and organizers demanded further action to support the needs and wishes of the Indigenous community — including statewide observance of Indigenous Peoples’ Day — in front of the Mass. State House on Saturday. On Monday, Indigenous Peoples’ Day will officially replace Columbus Day in Boston following an <a href=""https://www.boston.gov/news/mayor-janey-establishes-indigenous-peoples-day-boston"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">executive order</a> signed by acting Mayor Kim Janey earlier this week. <br/><br/>“It&#39;s not just about culture,” said Jean-Luc Pierite, a member of the Tunica-Biloxi tribe and president of the North American Indian Center of Boston, who helped to organize the rally. “It is about different Indigenous nations and the defense of their sovereignty, the efforts to rematriate land and natural resources back to the original peoples and to continue being stewards for the local ecosystem.” <br/><br/>According to Pierite, to be Indigenous not only means to be native, but also to have a resilient government and remain on the land regardless if a nation state occupies that same space. <br/> <bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1633822319738,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-62e6-dde0-ad63-fbf6275a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1633822319738,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-62e6-dde0-ad63-fbf6275a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000016d-c9b6-dd16-a77f-fbfe22620000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017c-6764-dcca-a1fe-67f725c3002d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017c-6764-dcca-a1fe-67f725920000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>Indigenous nations with a historical and continued presence in Mass. include the Massachusett, the Nipmuc, and the Wampanoag tribes. At today’s event on the Boston Common, members of various tribes and their allies advocated for the protection of Indigenous heritage, greater transparency of Indigenous history in education, and the representation of Indigenous communities in local government.<br/><br/>For Tylee Tosia, a student at Tufts University and member of the Diné tribe who also attended last year’s march, Boston’s observance of Indigenous Peoples&#39; Day is long overdue.<br/><br/>“Finally. It took long enough,” said Tosia. “Now we just have to make sure it goes to the state level.”<br/><br/>Columbus Day was founded in 1934 after the Knights of Columbus and members of the Italian-American community <a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/10/14/232120128/how-columbus-sailed-into-u-s-history-thanks-to-italians"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">pushed for cultural recognition</a> through the commemoration of Christopher Columbus.<br/><br/>However, in recent years the continued celebration of the federally-recognized holiday has been <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2019/10/14/columbus-day-or-indigenous-peoples-day"" target=""_blank"" data-cms-id=""0000016d-c9b6-dd16-a77f-fbfe22620000"" data-cms-href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2019/10/14/columbus-day-or-indigenous-peoples-day"">met with controversy</a> and calls to address the problematic legacy of its namesake. Besides being falsely credited as having discovered the Americas, the arrival of Columbus also has been linked directly to enslavement, introducing deadly diseases and the genocide of Indigenous peoples. <br/><br/>“There&#39;s no question of the crimes against humanity that he committed here within the Western Hemisphere,” said Pierite. “When we actually look at what&#39;s going on with our people today, we see some of those same beats tied to that legacy of colonialism which Columbus brought.”<br/><br/>Pierite added that the revisionist version of Columbus’s history so often taught in school curricula is used to assimilate Indigenous students, furthering the erasure of their culture — and when students speak up about the truth they have learned from their people, they are punished.<br/><br/>“Today means that Indigenous peoples are not only seen,” said Pierite. “But our knowledge is actually affirmed.”<br/><br/>While today’s event celebrated the official instatement of Indigenous Peoples&#39; Day, some Bostonians have vocally resisted the change. For example, before Acting Mayor Janey signed the executive order on Wednesday, <a href=""https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2021/10/06/boston-indigenous-peoples-day-columbus-day/?p1=hp_primary"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">someone in the crowd interjected:</a> “What about the Italian-Americans?” <br/><br/>Janey, the first Black woman to be acting mayor of Boston, responded, “We should celebrate all cultures...justice is not a zero-sum game.”<br/><br/>Other members of the Italian-American community agree with the executive order. At today’s rally, organizations like Italian-Americans for Indigenous Peoples&#39; Day showed their support for renaming the holiday. <br/><br/>“There are certainly many, many of us who feel no pride in Columbus,” said Heather Leavell, co-founder of Italian-Americans for Indigenous Peoples&#39; Day. <br/><br/>“It&#39;s just time that we listen to Indigenous people, hear what they&#39;re telling us, learn from them, center them, and celebrate them,” said Leavell. “It&#39;s time.”<br/><br/><i>Taylor Blackley is a general assignment reporter and staff photographer/videographer at The Scope: Boston and a Northeastern graduate student.</i><br/><br/><i>Elena Giardina is a reporter at The Scope: Boston and an undergraduate journalism and English student at Northeastern University. </i>",0000017c-6758-d82a-af7c-e7d91d8c0000,Sat Oct 09 20:54:31 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He worries about prison conditions with staffing shortages. <br/><br/>&quot;The prisoners won&#39;t be able to go to programs, they won&#39;t be able to do rehabilitative activities,’’ he said. “The place will be shut down in a way that is destructive to the whole purpose of corrections.”",Jenifer B.

And here I am,” said Georgia Hutchison.<br/><br/>Nearby, Sam Roberts put boats on display at his tent. His company, Fluidesign, builds custom shells for elite rowers, including 20 customers he said were going to pick up their orders just before competing in the Head.<br/><br/>“We have all of our boats custom fit to the athletes,” he said. “So we take all their measurements, we pre-calibrate the boat, make all the adjustments, and all they need to do is just add water and start rowing.”<br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1634867303409,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1634867303409,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-a5ac-d985-a5fc-adad851d0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017c-a5ac-dd9e-abfe-a7af6b790000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017c-a5ac-dd9e-abfe-a7af6b600000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">An old, bearded man wearing a Casitas Rowing club shirt sits at a picnic table in the shade.</bsp-image><br/><br/>Competitor Don Tanhauser was sitting by himself on a picnic bench in some shade, relaxing after a morning practice on the water.

But we feel that it&#39;s important to honor that tradition.

The same could likely be said for the thousands who clogged bridges between Cambridge and Boston and lined the banks of both sides of the river to cheer on the rowers.<br/><br/>James Moore had never been to the Head of the Charles before this year. His daughter, Sarique, was on the water with Johnson &amp; Wales University&#39;s women&#39;s <a href=""https://providence.jwuathletics.com/sports/wrowing/2021-22/bios/moore_sarique_13ut?view=bio"" target=""_blank"">collegiate eight</a> crew. <br/><br/>&quot;It&#39;s pretty cool,&quot; he said. &quot;Lots of boats, lots of people. I&#39;m a runner, so this is bigger than a running event.&quot; <br/><br/>Teams descended from all over for the regatta — some meeting their marks, others falling short. But regardless of their final times, just being at the Head of the Charles may have been bigger than anything else this year. <br/><br/>Claire Collins was on the women&#39;s four team at <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2021/07/21/meet-the-21-bay-staters-competing-in-the-tokyo-olympic-games"" target=""_blank"">this year&#39;s Olympics in Tokyo</a>. The Princeton alum — a Hedwig on the Hogwarts shell — said the return of big events like the Olympics and the Head of the Charles means a lot to the tight-knit rowing community.<br/><br/>&quot;I was reminded of that when I was at the Olympics, just watching — obviously rowing, but also watching other races, meeting other people,&quot; she said. &quot;And even here, it&#39;s like everyone came out this weekend to watch and support. ... It&#39;s so fun that everyone is just excited to come back.&quot;<br/><br/>By day&#39;s end, the banks of the Charles looked like they had just been through a carnival after three days of rowing revelry and the Hogwarts boat had amassed a small group of admirers. Caryn Davies, a two-time Olympic gold medalist in the women&#39;s eight, had her best Sybill Trelawney costume on. She said she couldn&#39;t compare the Olympics to the regatta, but she pointed out one key difference. <br/><br/>&quot;Well, we don&#39;t wear costumes in the Olympics,&quot; she said. <br/>",Esteban Bustillos,Sun Oct 24 20:57:24 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What looked to be dozens of tents and other makeshift accommodations lined the streets Monday afternoon, sometimes completely overtaking sidewalks and forcing pedestrians into close quarters with traffic. <br/><br/>As Boston develops procedures to fully implement the new executive order, city employees will be posting notices where tents have to be removed, according to a city spokesperson, adding that no person will be asked to move their tent without first being offered shelter.<br/><br/>It&#39;s clear that the city&#39;s plan will be no easy process. For Janey&#39;s part, she has emphasized that the process of clearing Mass and Cass should center on treating people with dignity, giving appropriate notice and opportunity for people to remove their shelters and, among other guidelines, not criminalizing the status of being an unsheltered individual, an individual with a substance use disorder or an individual with mental illness. <br/><br/>&quot;The last thing any of us want to do is to revictimize or traumatize individuals who are in need of support and services,&quot; she told reporters Monday.<br/><br/>Part of the effort has come from shelter providers, who are setting aside beds for people who are coming in. Pine Street Inn President &amp; Executive Director Lyndia Downie told GBH News that there&#39;s no perfect path to combatting the homelessness and addiction issues at Mass and Cass.<br/><br/>&quot;We need to throw as many things on the wall and see what sticks and what will work for people, because there&#39;s no perfect system out there for this level of addiction and complexity around the health care issues, the public safety issues, the public health issues and the housing issues,&quot; she said. <br/><br/>Downie said the city is trying hard to balance harm reduction with public safety and public health. And while there&#39;s been a steady stream of criticism of Janey&#39;s plan, Downie pointed out that if there was already sufficient support, then people wouldn&#39;t be on Mass and Cass in the first place. <br/><br/>&quot;And so I think we&#39;re all trying to look at, systemically, you have to do two things: you have to work with people on a one-on-one basis and help them find a path. And then you have to strategically work on &#39;what is the system we want?&#39; You’ve got to do both,&quot; she said.<br/><br/>Although GBH News couldn&#39;t get anyone to talk on the record at Mass and Cass Monday, there didn&#39;t appear to be a general sense of urgency around what the city is going to do in the days to come. <br/><br/>One man, Ronald Geddes, told <a href=""https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/boston-begins-mass-and-cass-cleanup-monday/2534685/"" target=""_blank"">NBC10 Boston</a> that he doesn&#39;t want to be there, but also doesn&#39;t want to go to a shelter.<br/><br/>&quot;I don&#39;t want to live on the streets, I don&#39;t want to live in a tent, I want to live in a house like everybody else,&quot; he said. <br/>","Esteban Bustillos, Mark Herz",Mon Oct 25 21:45:31 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pumpkins And Other Crops,"In West Bridgewater, farmer Peter Reading picked up one of his pumpkins and turned it around to assess the damage.<br/><br/>&quot;I mean, you see the pumpkin here, it looks perfectly fine. You flip it over on the other side and you see how soft it is,” he said. &quot;It&#39;s just breaking down from the inside out — and it&#39;s just way, way too much. And it&#39;s pumpkin after pumpkin after pumpkin.&quot;<br/><br/>Record-setting rains this summer left a lasting impact on farms across Massachusetts by creating prime conditions for pathogens and fungi to rot entire fields of crops, from Reading&#39;s pumpkins to cranberries on Cape Cod. The full extent of the crop loss is not yet known, but the state USDA office says they expect to request a federal disaster declaration.

Higgins said that’s because growing conditions vary, and not every field is infested with phytophthora. <br/><br/>“If the pathogen isn’t there, obviously it can’t infect your crops, and you might have a totally fine crop, especially if you have well-drained soils,” she said.<br/><br/>The fruit rot also hit the state’s most valuable crop: cranberries. <br/><br/>“With the excess rain that we had this summer, plus the heat, they were basically just kind of cooking in that environment of moist air, and that’s the perfect condition for fungi to grow and cause the rot that we’re seeing now,” said Brian Wick, executive director of the Cape Cod Cranberry Growers Association. <br/><br/>Last year, the state’s cranberry crop was down because of drought conditions, and farmers had been hoping to make up for that this year with a strong harvest. <br/><br/>The commissioner of the state Department of Agricultural Resources, John Lebeaux, wants to make sure people still support their local farmers because there is still locally-grown produce to be had. <br/><br/>Many farmers have insurance to help when they have a bad year, he said.<br/><br/>“It doesn&#39;t make them whole,” Lebeaux said. “But it takes some of the sting away.”<br/><br/>That kind of insurance may get more and more necessary as the climate changes. <br/><br/>It can be hard to say definitively that something like a drought or an especially rainy season is the direct result of climate change. But as the planet heats up, we’re going to see more of these extremes, said Peter Huybers of Harvard, who studies how climate change will alter crop production.<br/><br/>“As you warm the air, every degree Celsius you warm it, it holds 7 percent more water vapor,” Huybers said.<br/><br/>That means air coming from a dry area has the capacity to draw more water out of soils, causing drought. And air coming from over the ocean has more water in it to dump as rain.<br/><br/>For some farmers, the impacts of the changing climate have been clear for years.<br/><br/>“I don’t care what anybody says … we knew before anything was mentioned about climate change [that] it’s been here,” said Lynn Reading of C&amp;C Reading Farm. “You just have to make sure that you put enough money away so that you&#39;re able to, not go out of business and make sure you have enough money for the next season.&quot;<br/><br/>She said they’ll be OK. But they’re really hoping for better weather and a more productive harvest next season. ",Craig LeMoult,Wed Oct 27 16:06:31 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Florida and Louisiana were ranked as the most conservative while Hawaii and Vermont joined Massachusetts among the most liberal.<br/><br/>“Obviously the people who believe that the government should be constrained and should spend less, and should play a smaller role in our lives, believe this is a bad trend for the state of Massachusetts,” Schlapp said. <br/><br/>But Jesse Rhodes, a political science professor at UMass Amherst, says it is not surprising that the state legislature is considered the most liberal. What the survey failed to take into account, he said, is the positions of those who live in the legislatures’ states. <br/><br/>“Whenever an organization, be it conservative or liberal, puts out a ranking of states or state legislators, the rankings usually reflect the priorities of the organization that is doing the ranking. And there’s not always a lot of nuances about how the behavior of the legislators relates to the preferences of their constituents,” Rhodes said. “That’s really the critical relationship that we should care about if we care about democracy.”<br/><br/>Massachusetts residents received a similar distinction to their legislature in 2018, when a <a href=""https://news.gallup.com/poll/247016/conservatives-greatly-outnumber-liberals-states.aspx"">Gallup poll</a> found them to be the most liberal in the nation. <br/><br/>Rhodes has heard anecdotes from conservative residents who are unhappy with their lack of representation, especially with the Massachusetts congressional delegation, in his work as an associate director of the UMass Amherst Poll. Yet overall, he said, residents view the state legislature as performing better than the federal government or Congress.<br/><br/>Others say Massachusetts lawmakers aren’t liberal enough. Jonathan Cohn, chair of the issues committee at Progressive Massachusetts, disagreed with the ranking. The Commonwealth has a high number of Democratic legislators, he said, but the legislation they pass isn’t as progressive when compared to states like California or New York. He believes Massachusetts is behind on key progressive legislation, like same-day voter registration and allowing undocumented immigrants to obtain driver’s licenses. <br/><br/>“My initial thought on Massachusetts being ranked as the most liberal in the country is — I wish,” Cohn said.<br/>",Hannah Green,Thu Oct 28 19:38:18 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That’s why President Joe Biden&#39;s administration launched <a href=""https://www.sponsorcircles.org/"" target=""_blank"">a program</a> that allows groups of private citizens, called “sponsor circles,” to help acclimate evacuees to the country.

A resettlement agency found the family housing, and they moved into a three-bedroom apartment in Lynn in mid-October. <br/><br/>“It’s peaceful here and everything is provided to us, to my kids and my family,” Mohmand said in a phone interview through interpreter Rahmatullah Aka, who is a manager of community services for International Institute of New England, a Massachusetts-based resettlement provider. “People have been helping with housing, medical, food. I feel comfortable compared to the way we lived before.” <br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1635962822514,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1635962822514,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;migration.caption&quot;:&quot;Abdul Qayum, a former Afghan interpreter for the U.S. military, and his three children on the day they moved into their apartment in Lynn. &quot;,&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-e2b1-d646-ad7f-ffff820d0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;Abdul Qayum, a former Afghan interpreter for the U.S. military, and his three children on the day they moved into their apartment in Lynn. &quot;,&quot;altTextOverride&quot;:&quot;An Afghan man holds two young children who are sitting on his lap.

The resettlement agencies have told the Biden administration that we only have so much capacity to do our work,” said Jeffrey Thielman, president and CEO of the International Institute of New England, one of 200 resettlement agencies. “We were decimated under the Trump administration. The number of resettlement agencies in this country dropped by about 35 percent. All of the agencies that do this work reduced staff.” <br/><br/>At least five people — all of whom live in the same community — are needed to create a sponsor circle. The members agree to help for at least the first 90 days of a newcomer&#39;s resettlement, which may involve responsibilities such as helping them find a place to live, enrolling children in schools, connecting them with English language classes, and basic necessities like food and clothing. They are also expected to be sensitive to religion and culture, and understand that evacuees might be arriving with trauma.<br/><br/>People who apply to be part of a sponsor circle will be subject to a mandatory background check and a test on understanding the legal status, documentation and benefits available to Afghan evacuees. That includes a working knowledge and no judgment of the legal issues around humanitarian parole, the government program used to bring in the Afghans, which is only used in emergency situations when other protections are unsuitable because of long processing times.<br/><br/>Humanitarian parolees can stay in the United States for up to two years, although they can be approved to stay longer until they achieve asylum or become a special immigrant visa holder. They are authorized to work, receive a social security card, and are eligible for a driver’s license. <br/><br/>Once the sponsor circle applicants understand the responsibilities they will take on, they must raise at least $2,275 per person they wish to help and demonstrate they secured 60% of those funds before submitting their application.<br/><br/>The State Department created the program with Community Sponsorship Hub, a project created this year by Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisers Inc. They were aided by RefugePoint, a Massachusetts-based nonprofit that has spent decades identifying Afghan refugees abroad to resettle. <br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1635963065852,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1635963065852,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;migration.alignment&quot;:&quot;LEFT&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-e67a-db78-a57f-f77f781b0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;RefugePoint Founder and CEO Sasha Chanoff, seen on Zoom, speaks about the significance of the sponsor circle program. &quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017c-e679-ddc0-a77e-f77fd75e0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:&quot;/enhancement/EnhancementLeft.hbs&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017c-e679-ddc0-a77e-f77fd6e40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">A man sits behind a microphone. Photographs and books are on the wall behind him.</bsp-image><br/>RefugePoint Founder and CEO Sasha Chanoff considers the new “sponsor circle” program to be one of the most significant innovations in U.S. refugee resettlement since the 1980 Refugee Act. That law established the modern-day Refugee Admissions Program and nearly tripled the annual ceiling of refugees to 50,000.<br/><br/>“These evacuations, of course, were unprecedented. The number of people we brought in so quickly, the need to evacuate people from Kabul, the heartbreaking nature of those evacuations, the fact that people were fleeing for their lives,” Chanoff said. “Now these people are here in the U.S. — these Afghan evacuees — and we have a crisis situation on our hands. But at the same time, out of crisis is often born innovation and opportunity.&quot;<br/><br/>Because the sponsor circle program is not government-funded, RefugePoint is looking for private donors to keep it moving, with $25 million in seed money from Airbnb and resources from other groups like the International Rescue Committee.<br/><br/>“People who engage in this process often find that it&#39;s the most meaningful thing they&#39;ve ever done,” said Chanoff. <br/><br/>Mohmand said the help provided by the International Institute of New England has been vital for his family. He described being given a one-time payment of $1,225 from the federal government for each family member to help pay rent, though he says he’d like to find a security job and pay his own rent.<br/><br/>“People here are always coming to my house, even checking on me to see if I need something,&quot; he said. &quot;So, this is really, really great for me and I&#39;m really appreciating all these supporters.”",Sarah Betancourt,Wed Nov 03 15:00:06 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,Centuries-Old Portuguese Tradition Of Winemaking Lives On In New Bedford,Centuries-Old Portuguese Tradition Of Winemaking Lives On In New Bedford,"In the rear garage of Luzo’s Auto Body Shop, shelves are lined with squeegees, power washers and bottles of polish. But today, nobody’s buffing scratches off a Honda Civic. Today, half a dozen men are making wine.<br/><br/>In Fall River and New Bedford, more than one-third of residents claim Portuguese ancestry. Multiple waves of immigrants arrived here, dating back to the late 1700s when mariners came from Portugal’s Azorean islands to staff the booming whaling industry. To this day, many of these residents connect with their histories and homeland through the centuries-old Portuguese tradition of winemaking. And at Luzo&#39;s, it is an annual custom.<br/><br/>Two men take turns pouring buckets of crushed grapes — a 50-50 mix of zinfandel and Alicante varieties — into the waist-high wooden barrel of a grape press.<br/><br/>Just before the barrel overflows, one man places a wooden disk atop the crushed grapes. He turns a metal crank. With each spin, the disk descends into the barrel, compressing the must. Within seconds, a spout at the bottom of the grape press starts to run.<br/><br/>As the first drops of grape juice splatter into a pail, cheers erupt throughout the garage. It’s like prospectors striking gold.<br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1635965513822,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1635965513822,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-e723-db78-a57f-f73f393b0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017c-e723-d49d-af7e-ffab26e70000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017c-e723-d49d-af7e-ffab26c90000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">A man with purple juice and bits of grape coating his hands</bsp-image><br/><h3>From past to present</h3><br/>John Pinheiro owns Luzo’s Auto Body. He grew up on Faial Island in the Azores. Pinheiro’s father was the harpooner on a whaling ship in the 1930s and &#39;40s, but he’d return home to the family farm each fall when the grapes ripened.<br/><br/>Pinheiro recalls friends and family gathering at their adega — a small, countryside cabin — to crush the grapes and ferment wine. The ritual was accompanied by food and song.<br/><br/>But in the late 1950s when Pinheiro was 17, his childhood home was destroyed, buried in ash from a nearby volcanic eruption, along with his family’s farm and adega. They evacuated across the Atlantic to New Bedford. The transition was hard.<br/><br/>“When I left the island, I cried,” says Pinheiro. “If I could swim back when I first came here, I would have.”<br/><br/>New Bedford bore little resemblance to Faial. But Pinheiro’s father kept the winemaking tradition alive.<br/><br/>In 1967, Pinheiro’s father opened Luzo’s Auto Body. Ever since, the shop’s rear garage transforms into an adega for one day each fall.<br/><h3>‘A means to get us all together’</h3><br/>Today, Pinheiro and his collaborators press more than 1,000 pounds of grapes.

He said Remy was the glue for the whole organization and recalled just how generous he was. <br/><br/>During spring training one year, Ratanakommon said Remy gave him his phone number in case he ever needed tickets for a game. <br/><br/>“You know, I still have it in my phone, after 14 phones later,” he said. “He said, ‘You ever need anything, give me a call. And leave a message if I can’t pick up.’ That’s just part of his generosity, it’s part of his spirit, you know.”<br/><br/>For as big of a personality as he was, Ratanakommon said Remy knew how privileged he was to have his role on the team. <br/><br/>“I got to see him almost every day, every game day when we were at home, and again, [he was] always smiling, always chipper and always prepared,” he said. “And I think, again, he really, really was aware of his position and how he can affect the people around him and the fans.”<br/><br/>Inside, the chapel had been converted into a museum of Remy’s career, with photos and memorabilia from his playing days and broadcast career displayed for attendees. Two TVs played highlights of his career on a loop, ushers handed out replicas of Remy’s baseball card and fans wrote messages to Remy on big notecards placed just outside the chapel doors. <br/><br/>Robert Pellegrine and Carol Wilson are neighbors in Waltham, but Pellegrine describes their relationship as that of a mother and son, always talking about Red Sox games together. <br/><br/>“I’ve got the second-floor porch, she’s got the first floor-porch. Whenever anything’s going on, she always yells up, ‘Bobby, you up there?’” he said with a chuckle. <br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1636075899231,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-dc46-dd0e-abfa-fc7f12090000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1636075899231,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-dc46-dd0e-abfa-fc7f12090000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-edb6-d49d-af7e-ffbfd1420001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017c-edb6-ddc0-a77e-ffb7bc8a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017c-edb6-ddc0-a77e-ffb7bc560000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">20211104_174652.jpg</bsp-image><br/><br/>Wilson remembers sitting on her dad’s knee watching Red Sox games as a kid, and Pellegrine recalled watching games on a TV his grandfather used so often he eventually had to paint new dials on. They’re about as hardcore of Red Sox fans as it gets. And the way they talked about Remy, it sounded like he was family. <br/><br/>“He was just a regular guy, you know? Any sports [players] in Boston that were all-stars like Larry Bird, Bobby Orr, Jim Rice, Steve Grogan, all regular guys,” Pellegrine said. “And I think that’s what people are gonna look back at, you know?”<br/><br/>Wilson said Red Sox fans will miss Remy’s constant presence in the broadcast booth. <br/><br/>“Especially when we go to the games and he’s not up there,” she said. “Yeah, that’s gonna be hard.”<br/><br/>But, inside the chapel, it felt less like a wake and more like a celebration of a man who made complete strangers feel at home whenever he called a game. At the head of chapel, Remy’s casket, flanked by photos of Fenway, a plaque listing his accomplishments, a Red Sox jersey and a #2 from the Green Monster, was accompanied by a home plate, a guide for Remy to round the bases one last time. <br/>",Esteban Bustillos,Thu Nov 04 22:00:28 EDT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,ACLU Sues City To Stop 'Fundamentally Unlawful' Tent-Clearing And Arrests At Mass. and Cass,ACLU Sues City To Stop 'Fundamentally Unlawful' Tent-Clearing And Arrests At Mass. and Cass,"The ACLU of Massachusetts has filed a class-action lawsuit seeking to bar the city of Boston from arresting unhoused people and removing their tents from encampments around Mass. Ave and Melnea Cass Blvd. without first identifying viable alternative housing options for the people living there. <br/><br/>“We’ve tried to arrest our way out of this, and it didn’t work,” ACLU executive director Carol Rose told GBH News, referencing the Walsh administration’s ‘<a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2019/10/03/the-aclu-is-suing-boston-for-information-about-operation-clean-sweep"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>Operation Clean Sweep</u></a>’ of Mass. and Cass in 2019. “When you have a law enforcement response to a public health crisis, it&#39;s simply going to stay. That’s not theoretical — we experienced it.” <br/><br/>The lawsuit filed Thursday seeks monetary damages for the plaintiffs — three people experiencing homelessness identified as Ronald Geddes, AC and RAR — on the grounds that the city violated both their fourth and eighth amendment rights prohibiting unlawful seizures of property and cruel and unusual punishment.<br/><br/>“People are moving into their cars or under bridges or into other places, they’re losing their tents and their belongings, including their IDs and things like that, and they&#39;re being forced to go into other places far away from the services that they need,” Rose said. “They really aren&#39;t being offered appropriate shelter by the city, despite the assurances that they were going to do that.” <br/><br/>The <a href=""https://www.aclum.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/geddes_complaint.pdf"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>complaint</u></a>, filed in the Suffolk County Supreme Judicial Court, requests a restraining order to prevent the state and city from continuing to evict and arrest people in the area, and a preliminary injunction that allows occupants of the encampment to return to the area and live there, “unless and until Defendants identify alternative housing arrangements that take into account their individual needs.” <br/><br/>“The ACLU doesn&#39;t think that the appropriate remedy is necessarily that we should do nothing, but we can’t force the government to give people appropriate housing,” Rose said. “The remedy has to be that you cannot use the threat of taking away someone&#39;s liberty as a way to force them, to displace them from wherever they are unless they have a place to go.” <br/><br/>The lawsuit names defendants including the City of Boston, the Boston Police Dept., the Boston Public Health Commission and individuals acting as heads of those agencies, including acting Boston Mayor Kim Janey. <br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1636138300829,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1636138300829,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-c3f2-d208-a97c-dbf375e50001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017c-f170-dfb8-af7d-f5f4f5780000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017c-f170-dfb8-af7d-f5f4f5290000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">image00005.jpeg</bsp-image><br/>When asked about the lawsuit at a news conference Friday morning, Janey said she would not respond specifically to ongoing litigation, but she added  “we will certainly comply with the courts and ... our approach has been a public health approach where we first provide notice.” <br/><br/>Janey said city outreach workers have referred more than 60 unsheltered individuals to in-patient treatment, city shelters, transitional housing, and assistance to return them to stable homes. Last month, Boston Health and Human Services Chief Marty Martinez said that around 350 people were living in the area, according to a city survey. <br/><br/>“We are working hard to identify beds, and we are not asking anyone to remove their property or to move off the streets without first identifying a place for them to go that is appropriate,&quot; Janey told reporters. &quot;We are working hard to match the individual needs of the people who are living on the streets, living in tents, with the appropriate treatment and shelter options available.”<br/><br/>Janey noted that “we have just begun this work this week, it is ongoing outreach that happens every single day to connect individuals who need support to treatment and to services. We have made progress. There&#39;s more work to do, but we continue to use a public health approach.” <br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1636138626582,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1636138626582,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-f175-dfb8-af7d-f5f556590001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017c-f175-ddc0-a77e-f7772a300000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017c-f175-ddc0-a77e-f77729f90000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">IMG_7099.jpg</bsp-image><br/>Janey issued an <a href=""https://www.boston.gov/sites/default/files/file/2021/10/public-health-eo-10-19-21.pdf"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>executive order</u></a> last month, detailing plans to remove the encampments at Mass. and Cass and move people living there into shelter. <br/><br/>“With this executive order, residents facing substance use disorder and unsheltered homelessness can have the shelter and treatment they need to help them be safe and get better,” a <a href=""https://www.boston.gov/news/executive-order-outlines-strategy-address-public-health-and-encampments-boston"">statement from the city</a> reads.

Those BPHC employees did not confirm whether beds were in fact available at the Pine Street Inn men’s shelter, nor did they even ask whether there were any barriers, such as his PTSD, that would make such an option not viable for him.” <br/><br/>The complaint also points out that &quot;the City has stated that it will arrest people with open warrants in the area. As a result of these pronouncements, people living in the area — who often do not know whether they have outstanding warrants, since many do not receive summonses or other written notice of court hearings precisely because of their homelessness — are living in fear of being seized at any time.” <br/><br/>The city convened what it called  &quot;Community Reponse Sessions&quot; — makeshift court sessions in the Suffolk County jail — for people arrested on criminal warrants in the area. <br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1636138356043,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1636138356043,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-ec95-db78-a57f-fdbfc2d40001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017c-f171-dfb8-af7d-f5f5e90a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017c-f171-dfb8-af7d-f5f5e8e50000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">IMG_8136.JPG</bsp-image><br/>As of Friday, roughly half the people brought into the court have been allowed to seek treatment in a medical setting, the others have been sent to jail.

Charlie Baker by the Nov. 17 start of a mid-session recess, questions about the treatment of the two Gateway Cities on the South Coast <a href=""https://statehousenews.com/news/20212027"" style=""color: rgb(0, 106, 199); text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-skip-ink: none;"">pose a tricky dynamic</a>.<br/><br/>Congressman William Keating, who represents the 9th District, supports adding Fall River into his district alongside New Bedford, as do Sens. Michael Rodrigues and Mark Montigny, who represent Fall River and New Bedford respectively, Rep. Alan Silvia of Fall River, New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell, and the Drawing Democracy Coalition of voting advocacy groups.<br/><br/>A sizable contingent of Fall River and area officials want their city to remain in the 4th District, though, including Mayor Paul Coogan, City Council President Cliff Ponte Jr., Rep. Carole Fiola and Rep. Patricia Haddad, who represents nearby communities of Dighton, Somerset, Swansea and Taunton.<br/><br/>They told Moran&#39;s panel that the map as proposed would allow a unified Fall River to be the most populous community in the 4th District and would require two different members of the state&#39;s U.S. House delegation to focus on the South Coast region.<br/><br/>&quot;This region will have the strength of two federal voices when we need them to come together on mutual interests,&quot; Fiola said.<br/><br/>Backers of the map as drafted added that despite some similarities, New Bedford and Fall River have different racial and ethnic makeups and different economic engines, with commercial fishing representing a major industry in New Bedford and Fiola saying &quot;Fall River has no fishing industry.&quot;<br/><br/>Another complicating factor is the need to keep all nine congressional districts at about the same population.<br/><br/>Moran said during Tuesday&#39;s hearing that map-drawers wanted to strengthen the majority-minority status of the 7th Congressional District anchored in Boston, the only one in the state where nonwhite residents outnumber white residents, in this round of once-every-decade redistricting.<br/><br/>That shift left the 8th Congressional District represented by Congressman Stephen Lynch with &quot;an extra 40,000 people,&quot; Moran said, creating a knock-on effect on neighboring districts.<br/><br/>&quot;You can only give it to two people: you can give it to the 9th and you can give it to the 4th,&quot; Moran said. &quot;You can&#39;t give it to the 7th, because that waters down the majority-minority district. So those 40,000 people have to be dispersed either to the 4th or to the 9th. You can only give so much to the 9th because the 9th can&#39;t give any population to anybody because it&#39;s surrounded by water, so the rest of it goes to the 4th.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;When you look at the sheer geography and the numbers, and you look at the 10th-largest city in the commonwealth, which is Fall River, it became a natural place for us to look to unify a big city down in the South Coast region,&quot; he added.<br/><br/>Congressman Jake Auchincloss, who represents the 4th District, told lawmakers on Tuesday that he supports the map as drafted, which would unite Fall River instead of splitting the city across two districts while placing it entirely under his representation.<br/><br/>&quot;The 4th Congressional District is socioeconomically, ideologically and geographically one of the most diverse in New England,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#39;ve got rural, suburban, rural areas, vote red and blue, commute to Boston and Providence, and that is a strength. That is a strength of a congressional district to have the full fabric of the commonwealth within it, to contain multitudes. I think it makes me a more effective representative in Congress, I think it would make any representative from this district more effective in Congress, and I think that diversity should be heralded as a strength rather than something that needs to be workshopped.&quot;<br/><br/>In a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAVwnpoYVtM&amp;ab_channel=WCVBChannel5Boston"" style=""color: rgb(0, 106, 199); text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-skip-ink: none;"">segment</a> on WCVB&#39;s &quot;On the Record&quot; that aired Sunday, veteran Democrat political analyst Mary Anne Marsh called the proposal to place all of Fall River in the 4th District &quot;the Jake Auchincloss incumbent protection plan.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It doesn&#39;t help New Bedford, it doesn&#39;t help Fall River, it only helps Jake,&quot; Marsh said. &quot;Every single congressman including Joe Kennedy, his predecessor, has always opposed splitting these two communities up or splitting Fall River in half, but not Jake. He&#39;s more than happy to take Fall River for himself.&quot;<br/><br/>Opponents of the proposed map also contend that Fall River and New Bedford would together be able to flex more political muscle if they shared a congressional district. While Fall River would be the largest city in the 4th District, they say, other communities have higher numbers of votes cast in elections.<br/><br/>Mitchell, who was first elected New Bedford&#39;s mayor in 2011, said the two cities share sizable Portuguese-American populations, a chamber of commerce, access to UMass Dartmouth and socioeconomic commonalities, similarities that warrant shared representation in Congress.<br/><br/>&quot;This concern that if Fall River were in the 9th District it would be overshadowed by New Bedford should cause people to step back and say, is that really going to be different in the 4th District?&quot; Mitchell said. &quot;Is it realistic to think Fall River is going to be the center of gravity in that district? I don&#39;t think so.&quot;<br/><br/>Legislative leaders have not outlined a specific timeline for advancing the congressional and Governor&#39;s Council redistricting proposals. Sen. Will Brownsberger, Moran&#39;s co-chair on the committee, said while unveiling the draft maps that officials hope to complete the final legislation this week and vote on it next week.<br/>",Chris Lisinski | State House News ,Tue Nov 09 17:17:01 EST 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I actually thought it might be good for my career. I was working for the BBC World Service already, and I was at that point in my career where I thought it would be smart to see if I would like the life of a foreign correspondent. So I went to visit my buddy, who was stationed in Kabul, just to try it out. <br/><br/><b>Schachter:</b> OK, so pretty soon after you got there, you hitched a ride out of Kabul on an aid convoy, and you had some real jaw-dropping adventures, both terrifying and touching, which is reflected in the title of your book. What did you learn from those adventures about Afghanistan and the Afghan people? <br/><br/><b>Woolf:</b> I think the thing that most stays with me is that there isn&#39;t one Afghanistan. The country is a mosaic of different peoples and interests and factions and powers. For example, there were people who were religious leaders and yet had been co-opted by the communist government because they [the government] could give them support in terms of revenue and foot soldiers in their locality. And, you know, just to see that kind of thing firsthand is bewildering to a Westerner. <br/><br/>And at the same time, you know, it seems obvious as well when you see it taking place, that different sides are cutting deals with each other. We had one point where we forced two sides that were fighting to organize a cease fire. And this one, the aid convoy leader told us, was relatively easy to arrange because the two fighting commanders were cousins. I can see it now, this little Kiwi guy [New Zealander], who was a bit of a bulldog personality, just bamboozling these two commanders to cease fire so we could get through with our supplies that were needed in the North. <br/><br/><b>Schachter:</b> So the two couldn&#39;t just share the valley? <br/><br/><b>Woolf:</b> Well, yes and no. But you know, they have to put on a show of fighting now and then. So again, that&#39;s another thing you learn about the country, is that a lot of what you see is not really what&#39;s going on. And I think anyone who spends any time there, especially if they spend time outside the wire, as you might say — outside of the safely held government areas — is going to learn very quickly the realities of the situation. <br/><br/><b>Schachter: </b>Chris, you and I worked together at the GBH and PRX program The World until a few years ago, and I know you&#39;re something of an historian, especially when it comes to things military. Given your experience in Afghanistan and your experience in general reporting on world affairs, how did American military leaders — and leaders in general — get things so wrong? <br/><br/><b>Woolf: </b>Well, that&#39;s a huge question. I think partly inertia — we were there, so we stayed — I think that was the most fundamental problem. <br/><br/>I actually saw no reason for the West to stay involved in Afghanistan directly after the fall of the Taliban regime at the end of 2001. It would have been obviously a lot smarter to just assemble — as we had done — a coalition of Afghans opposed to the Taliban. And I was thinking, &#39;Well, why not just keep them strong enough to keep the Taliban out, or at least weak?&#39; But for some reason, once we were in we stayed there, and I could never see a purpose there. So, I can&#39;t blame the military or even the officials who tried to make it work. It&#39;s really a failure of vision at the top in terms of what it is we were trying to do. And to me, it seemed like pure hubris to try and remake a country like Afghanistan in our image, when it is in many ways very alien to our experiences and our culture. So it was always going to be an uphill struggle. <br/><br/>And of course, the one thing that Afghans can agree on is that they don&#39;t like foreigners telling them what to do. That was another fundamental mistake. Having foreign troops there at all is going to create opposition. You know, it seems for anyone who knows the country knows it&#39;s going to be creating problems, however benevolent the foreigners may be, and how much they may be really sincerely trying to help the country. You know, nobody here would like foreigners coming in with arms telling us what to do, however beneficially. They&#39;re still going to be acting as though they run the place, and that&#39;s that&#39;s going to put people&#39;s backs up. <br/><br/><b>Schachter: </b>Now, given what you know about the mujahideen — the Holy Warriors or Islamic rebels in Afghanistan — and what you know of the history of conflict in that country, is there any way to predict where things might go now, with the Taliban in charge? <br/><br/><b>Woolf: </b>There are huge constituencies in Afghanistan that are repelled by the Taliban&#39;s ideology. The Taliban is a legitimate force, but so many people in the cities, so many of the educated people, so many of the women, so many of the minorities that the Taliban are hostile to. ... My hope is that eventually these constituencies will find themselves strong enough to force an accommodation with the Taliban and build a country that&#39;s more just and more inclusive. <br/><br/><b>Schachter: </b>In the meantime, though, we will likely see more refugees, likely many more refugees, including here in Massachusetts. How do you think we would be best equipped to to handle the difference in experience and culture [between us and them] that you witnessed? <br/><br/><b>Woolf: </b>It&#39;s not just the cultural differences. Let&#39;s remember a lot of these people will have suffered trauma and they will also have relatives and close friends and family left behind who are still in danger. And that kind of stress and trauma is going to be one of the foremost things that they&#39;ll be bringing with them. But then culturally, there&#39;s also going to be a lot of shocks as well. For example, a lot of women in a lot of parts of Afghanistan <i>are</i> more sequestered. And they <i>are</i> expected to have a less visible profile, especially in the countryside. It&#39;s just the culture. So that&#39;s going to be a challenge to try and figure out a way forward. But in many other ways, they&#39;re just people who want ordinary things for themselves: some security, somewhere to live and jobs to be able to provide for their families.

Article,Quincy High grapples with how to move forward from racial incidents,Quincy High grapples with how to move forward from racial incidents,"Parents and community members brought their anger, confusion and determination to a meeting at Quincy High School on Monday night to address how to respond to a series of racial incidents that led to last week&#39;s student walkout.<br/><br/>One of the incidents was a student-made rap song that included racist and sexist language. The other was a video that a white student at the high school made several years ago, while they were in seventh grade. In the video, the student allegedly uses racist language against Black people, including the n-word. <br/><br/>On Friday, students walked out in protest of the videos and the school&#39;s response. Kate Campbell, co-president of the Quincy Citywide Parent Teacher Organization and parent of two Quincy High students, told GBH News on Sunday that emotions had been building up long before the walkout.<br/><br/>“For students, it was a culmination of feeling unheard for a long time,” she said. “Feeling like the climate and the culture in the high school was untenable for a large part of the population in the high school.”<br/><br/>The incidents and student walkout both hung over Monday&#39;s meeting, where participants broke out into smaller groups to talk about next steps before meeting in a larger group with Quincy Public Schools Superintendent Kevin Mulvey.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1637030152975,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-dc46-dd0e-abfa-fc7f12090000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1637030152975,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-dc46-dd0e-abfa-fc7f12090000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-0aa2-d8e1-a97f-7bab2ee10003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-02e9-d7af-a3ff-e6fd6ada0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-2699-dab0-a57d-ef9d2119002d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-2699-dab0-a57d-ef9d1f060000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>The meeting became contentious at times when school and district administrators spoke, with some attendees demanding immediate answers as to what the next steps will be and grilling Quincy High Principal Lawrence Taglieri about the school&#39;s response to the videos. <br/><br/>Several attendees walked out during Taglieri’s remarks, calling them “lip service.”<br/><br/>Mulvey said the district would use information gathered at Monday&#39;s meeting, along with data collected previously from parent focus groups and surveys, to assess concerns and create responses. <br/><br/>“We intend to identify areas we can move on immediately, which we will do,” he said. “The mayor is in full support of that, the school committee is in full support of that, and we will move as quickly as possible and — I said in there tonight — immediately to make some of these changes that they have identified.”<br/><br/>But Larry Brown and Pauline Russell-Brown, who have two children who attend Quincy High, pointed out that any solutions won’t come quickly. <br/><br/>“This ain’t gonna happen overnight. It’s just not,” Brown said.<br/><br/>Still, Russell-Brown said Monday&#39;s meeting was a start. <br/><br/>“There’s definitely a long, long road,” she said. “It’s gonna take a lot of, lot of people. A lot of people who weren’t here, unfortunately. I believe that all the people that attended tonight, they want to be part of the solution, you know what I mean? It’s just unfortunate that the people who … keep this issue going, they’re not here and they’re not listening. So we need to be more vocal, more visible, more diligent.”<br/>",Esteban Bustillos,Tue Nov 16 10:21:05 EST 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,Judge rules against ACLU lawsuit seeking to stop tent-clearing at Mass. and Cass,Judge rules against ACLU lawsuit seeking to stop tent-clearing at Mass. and Cass,"A Suffolk Superior Court Judge on Wednesday denied <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/news/2021/11/05/aclu-sues-city-to-stop-fundamentally-unlawful-tent-clearing-and-arrests-at-mass-and-cass"" rel=""nofollow"">a request from the ACLU of Massachusetts</a> for a temporary restraining order aimed at stopping the city of Boston’s dismantling of a homeless encampment near Massachusetts Avenue and Melnea Cass Boulevard, known as Mass. and Cass, near the city’s South End. <br/><br/>In her ruling, Judge Janet L. Sanders cited “certain problems” with the ACLU&#39;s argument, namely that no one has been arrested during the operation and that shelter beds are available. Regarding the ACLU’s claim that there is a “constitutional right to a certain kind of housing,” Sanders said that is “further than any court has ever gone.” <br/><br/>Though Sanders denied the request, she emphasized that the city needs to take steps to improve conditions for people displaced at Mass. and Cass — and do so prior to an evidentiary hearing scheduled for Nov. 29, when witnesses will be expected to testify and be cross-examined. <br/><br/>“This case has already received some attention,” Sanders said in her ruling. “What happens in the next 12 days is likely to receive the same public scrutiny. Indeed, those elected to represent us perhaps have the greatest interest in making sure that in this interim period, those at Mass. and Cass are treated with dignity and respect and afforded as much help as government resources.” <br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1637187572844,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1637187572844,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;Related Stories:&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-dbe5-dd5c-ad7f-fbed56100003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-f15f-d49d-af7e-fbdf6e040003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-076b-d7af-a3ff-e77f0c130000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-ec94-db78-a57f-fdbfba260003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-2ffb-d9b9-a7fd-efff10250002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-2ffb-d9b9-a7fd-efff0d8f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>In October, former acting Mayor Kim Janey issued an executive order stating that “tents and temporary shelters will no longer be allowed on the public ways in the City of Boston.” Attorney Lisa Maki, who represented the city of Boston, told the court that the removal process will not be as strict as that order states.<br/><br/>&quot;You can have a tent on a sidewalk in the city,&quot; Maki said. &quot;When the notice for removal and protocol steps are followed and the tent is still there, it is subject for removal.&quot; She added that tents can only be removed after the city has provided both 48-hour notice and an offer of shelter.<br/><br/>ACLU attorney Ruth Bourquin said she takes this as a small victory. <br/><br/>“That&#39;s a very different message that was given to the court by a representative of the city today than has been given to our clients,” Bourquin told reporters after the hearing. “I want to make sure our clients know this, because right now they are on the streets of Boston, scared to even put a tent over their head in order to try to keep themselves safe.” <br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1637187480906,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1637187480906,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-ddd3-d646-ad7f-dddfd0df0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-2ffa-dab0-a57d-efff21150000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-2ffa-dab0-a57d-efff20ef0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">IMG_8112.JPG</bsp-image><br/>The ruling came just hours after Mayor Michelle Wu told reporters the city would “pause” the <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2021/11/01/i-have-no-place-to-go-hundreds-leave-mass-and-cass-as-city-clears-tents"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>ongoing sweep</u></a> until the court ruled in favor of the ACLU’s request for a preliminary injunction. <br/><br/>Wu told reporters Wednesday she will continue working with Dr. Monica Bharel, her recently appointed &quot;Mass. and Cass czar,&quot; and other stakeholders “to ensure that we’re bringing a public health and housing-first lens.” <br/><br/>When asked if the executive order would resume if courts ruled in favor of the city, Wu responded, “not necessarily.” <br/><br/>Despite the pause, in court Maki argued in favor of continuing to clear tents. She cited public health issues, an infestation of rats, an excess of garbage and waste and blocked sidewalks. <br/><br/>“It is the city that faces irreparable harm if this waits any longer, it is the city’s preference that people are placed in individualized housing,” Maki said. “We’re not saying we don’t want that, it just doesn’t exist right now. Individualized housing is not a process that would be set up overnight.” <br/><br/>Maki also cited crime statistics that she said put the city in danger: six homicides in the area in the last year, 122 unattended deaths, and 13 reports of sexual assault. <br/><br/>The answer to these problems, Bourquin argued, is not “that the government can destroy your current living place and send you to someplace that may or may not be able to accommodate you, but is structurally set up in a way that you know only a few people can be accomodated,” Bourquin said. “[The city] just admitted private housing doesn’t exist yet.” <br/><br/>So far, the city’s efforts in accordance with the executive order have placed 39 people in shelter, 126 in medical treatment facilities and 16 in housing, including 12 people who are now in permanent housing, according to Maki. <br/><br/>But without transitional housing options available for everyone, many people living on Mass. and Cass have told GBH News they would rather remain on the street than live in a shelter environment. As of Tuesday, <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2021/11/16/were-backed-into-a-corner-new-homeless-encampment-rises-near-mass-and-cass"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>a new encampment of around 30 tents was created in Newmarket Square</u></a>, just a few blocks east of the city’s targeted clearing site. <br/><br/>Janey’s <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n_xJUlt5LTu0ZHatvdMLhN_mdoCxiRhK/view"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>executive order</u></a> states that if a tent owner refuses to remove their belongings off the street, it “may be considered disorderly conduct and subject to enforcement of the existing laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.” The city maintains that no arrests of this nature have taken place, though Bourquin argued that the order contained language constituting the threat of arrest, which she says is a violation of civil rights. <br/><br/>“So I guess it’s a ‘we should cross that bridge when we get to it’ type of thing,” Sanders said. “The city hasn&#39;t arrested anybody.

A prominent voice in The Black Arts Movement, Bullins founded Roxbury Crossroads Theatre and was committed to being a Black artist who reflected Black life. <br/><br/>Born in Philadelphia, Bullins moved to San Francisco in the early 1960s, enrolling in creative writing programs. He won his first Drama Desk Award in 1968 for his trilogy play <i>The Electronic N***** and Others. </i>In the &#39;70s, Bullins moved to New York, where he produced his plays off-Broadway and won an<i> </i>Obie Award in<i> </i>1975 for <i>The Taking of Miss Janie.</i> <br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1637338950096,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-62e6-dde0-ad63-fbf6275a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1637338950096,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-62e6-dde0-ad63-fbf6275a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-c775-d34e-ab7c-c7f7a5270003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-38ff-d0ab-a17d-7aff45360003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-38ff-d0ab-a17d-7aff44f50000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>After topping off his undergraduate studies at Antioch University with a Master of Fine Arts degree from San Francisco State in 1994, Bullins arrived in Boston with an appointment as a professor of theater and a distinguished artist-in-residence at Northeastern University in 1995. He went on to found the Roxbury Crossroads Theatre in 2006. “Black folks wanted to be in a space and put their voices out there and say ‘I&#39;m Black, I’m proud and these are my stories,&#39;&quot; said Jackie Davis, who was the theater&#39;s associate artistic director at the time. According to Davis, Bullins could have easily been an award-winning actor or a poet laureate, but he chose to put those stories on the stage. <br/><br/>Cliff Odle, playwright, actor and professor of theater at Bates College, credits Bullins’ work for today’s theater.<b> “</b>When I think of his legacy, I think of the Black Arts Movement. His works are so important when you think of its place in American theater history. We would not have the great work and playwrights we have today, like Suzan-Lori Parks and Lydia Diamond,” Odle said. <br/><br/>Among the numerous plays that Bullins wrote throughout his career, Odle said the one he would stage today would be <i>Salaam, Huey Newton, Salaam</i>.  “That is a strong reflection, a critique and condemnation of the aftermath of the &#39;60s after the death of Newton, who gave a lot to the cause, only to be killed by an African American. That’s something that still resonates.”<br/><br/>Anton Dudley, a playwright, director and librettist for both musicals and opera, also acknowledges Bullins’ influence on the next generation of playwrights. Dudley worked with Bullins as part of Cherry Lane Theatre’s Mentor Project, and remembers him as someone who was “generous and intelligent and worldly and perceptive and fair and didn&#39;t impose himself on my play.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I think we had the same kind of rage, and he made his rage into something productive, not something debilitating,&quot; Dudley continued. &quot;That’s what I wanted to do.”<br/><br/>Dawn Meredith Simmons, founder and director of the Front Porch Arts Collective, met Bullins when she was working at the actors’ alliance StageSource.<b> “</b>Without folks like him, it would be harder for the rest of us. He’s a point of pride in the Black community and Black theater and in literary circles. He helped to diversify what makes Boston theater so interesting.” <br/><br/>Jacqui Parker, artistic director of Our Place Theatre Project and the founder of Boston&#39;s annual African American Theatre Festival, frequently collaborated with Bullins. She described<b> </b>him as “a ‘gangster’ in the theater world in the best possible way.&quot;<br/><br/>Among Bullins&#39; many awards, he received two Guggenheim Fellowships as well as grants from the Rockefeller Foundation and the National Endowment of the Arts. But a common lament among Bullins’ colleagues is that he didn’t receive the exposure that his body of work deserved. Simmons’ advice to people who are just learning about Bullins is to “read his work, and read the work of his contemporaries, and wrestle with it.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The work was of a time,&quot; Simmons continued. &quot;Think about what has changed since these people were writing and fighting and grinding it out. Ask yourself, ‘has that much changed since they were written?’” <br/><br/>Davis added that anyone who isn’t familiar with Bullins is missing a bit of American history. “The conversations that he was having back in the &#39;60s and &#39;70s and &#39;80s are the conversations that we are still having today,” she said. Though Bullins is immortalized by his body of work, Davis said, “there&#39;s a hole in my heart and in the world of Black theater right now. We&#39;re in mourning. I knew this day was coming, but you&#39;re just never ready for it.”","Chelsea Merz, Jacob Garcia",Fri Nov 19 11:53:34 EST 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the beginning of the session, court was ordered into recess on multiple occasions until three arrests had been made later in the morning. <br/><br/>Though the purpose of the court session, according to a spokesperson from Janey’s office, was to place people with substance use disorder in treatment facilities and target those who commit “serious crimes” in the area, the majority of defendants brought in were arrested on outstanding warrants for minor drug charges. <br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1637585273122,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-62e6-dde0-ad63-fbf6275a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1637585273122,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-62e6-dde0-ad63-fbf6275a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-2f1a-dab0-a57d-ef1ff1530003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-dbe5-dd5c-ad7f-fbed56100003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-bcf6-d985-a5fc-bcff06010003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-478a-d9b9-a7fd-cf9ef6f9002d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-478a-d9b9-a7fd-cf9ef6b90000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, who recently announced a &quot;pause&quot; of the city&#39;s ongoing tent-clearing efforts at Mass. and Cass, told GBH News that the intention behind the court was to expedite the processing of outstanding warrants.

However, what was created wasn’t a full diversionary court,” Wu told GBH News. “It wasn&#39;t one of the special courts where the judges had the power to clear warrants from all across the state, it only applied to those with municipal warrants within Boston. And so in practice, it ended up that people had to be sent back to the other courts anyway to actually get the resolution that they needed.” <br/><br/>Cases that were being heard at the Community Response Session will “transition back to their respective divisions,” a trial court spokesperson said. “The Boston Municipal court will continue to communicate and collaborate with the City of Boston and state agencies to expand services to those court-involved individuals in need of services in every Division of the Boston Municipal Court.” <br/><br/>Anthony Benedetti, Chief Counsel for the Committee for Public Counsel Services, says his organization had been putting pressure on the state to conduct court business at courts where warrants could be processed more immediately. <br/><br/>“I want to thank the Trial Court for listening to our concerns and for putting an end to a project that never really accomplished what it set out to do,” Benedetti said in a statement to GBH News. “We have said from the beginning that the stated goals of this session could have, and should have, been achieved at a physical, existing courthouse. We will continue to represent the rights of all of our clients, many of whom are experiencing homelessness and substance use issues — societal problems that should be handled outside the criminal legal system.”<br/><br/>Wu <u><a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2021/11/17/judge-rules-against-aclu-lawsuit-seeking-to-stop-tent-clearing-at-mass-and-cass"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">“paused” the tent-clearing effort on Wednesday</a></u>, telling reporters that she will continue working with Dr. Monica Bharel, the former chief of the state&#39;s department of public health whom she <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2021/11/10/boston-mayor-elect-wu-to-name-former-dph-chief-to-clean-up-mass-and-cass"" target=""_blank"">recently appointed to clean up Mass. and Cass,</a> and other stakeholders “to ensure that we’re bringing a public health and housing-first lens.” <br/><br/>Later that day, a Suffolk Superior Court judge <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2021/11/17/judge-rules-against-aclu-lawsuit-seeking-to-stop-tent-clearing-at-mass-and-cass"" target=""_blank"">denied the ACLU of Massachusetts</a> a temporary restraining order to bar city officials from arresting unhoused people and removing their tents without first identifying viable alternative housing options for the people living there.<br/><br/>Though the ACLU lost in court to the city, Wu says she doesn&#39;t see this as a &quot;win or a loss.&quot; <br/><br/>“We&#39;re all headed in the same direction,&quot; Wu told GBH News, &quot;which is making sure that there are safe, warm homes for people all across the city and the region.”<br/><br/>Though the executive order continues to be paused, Wu maintained that “we never paused on the outreach, that is ongoing...but the barriers are still high for many of the shelter beds that are available, and we are now working quickly with a new team that we&#39;ve assembled to take down those barriers and to create even more low-threshold housing so that people have a real alternative to being on the streets in tents.” ",Tori Bedford,Mon Nov 22 07:50:52 EST 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,Local retailers are banking on a robust holiday shopping season,Local retailers are banking on a robust holiday shopping season,"Despite the pandemic and an uptick in COVID-19 cases, Massachusetts retailers have high hopes for this year&#39;s holiday shopping season. <br/><br/>Retailers Association of Massachusetts President Jon Hurst said they are predicting a 6 percent increase in sales over last year. &quot;An average holiday increase, historically over the decades, has been 4 percent,&quot; he said. &quot;So typically anything 4 percent or more is considered a very strong holiday season.&quot;<br/><br/>Every year, the association&#39;s 4,000 members are asked to take part in an annual holiday shopping survey. Hurst said in 2019, they reported that 26 percent of their sales were made online. That number increased to 50 percent last year, and it&#39;s risen to 60 percent this year.<br/><br/>Hurst said despite the jump, the real story in 2021 will be the return of the in-person shopper. &quot;They&#39;re getting back to a little bit more normalcy. That doesn&#39;t mean that online sales won&#39;t increase [or] go away — but maybe things are balancing out a little bit more now.&quot;<br/><br/>Still, retailers said this year&#39;s holiday shopping season has its challenges, with inflation at the top of their list of concerns. &quot;We all have seen that in our shopping and filling up cars and so forth,&quot; Hurst said.<br/><br/>Supply chain issues came in second on the list. Hurst said the stores are adequately stocked up, but he advises people to get out there and shop early.  &quot;If  you&#39;re one of these folks that procrastinate until the last weekend or the week before the holiday, you may disappointed on what your selection level is. We&#39;re urging consumers to be patient and to be flexible, flexible in their choices.&quot;<br/><br/>Hurst said local retailers want to see a big turnout for Small Business Saturday, which this year is Nov. 27.<br/><br/>&quot;Small Business Saturday has evolved a lot over the decades. In the early years, it was more about American Express. And it&#39;s really taken on a life of its own, with lots of campaigns at the state level and local level to remind the consumer to get out there and spend.&quot;<br/>",Mary Blake,Tue Nov 23 18:16:12 EST 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Globe&#39;s 2002 series earned it the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service in 2003, and “Spotlight” won Academy Awards for best picture and best original screenplay. Actor Neal Huff played Saviano in the film.<br/><br/>“My gift to the world was not being afraid to speak out,” Saviano said in mid-November in a brief telephone interview with The Associated Press.<br/><br/>Born June 23, 1952, Saviano recalled going to confession as a young boy at St. Denis Church in tiny East Douglas, Massachusetts, in the 1960s and whispering his transgressions through a screen to the Rev. David Holley. The priest, he said, <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/d62e914879e92c043a7ac3a595089add"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; color: var(--linkLightColor); text-decoration: none; background-color: transparent; font-size: inherit; cursor: pointer; outline: none; font-family: &quot;AP Serif&quot;; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;"">violated that sacred trust</a> and forced the 11-year-old to perform sex acts. Holley died in a New Mexico prison in 2008 while serving a 275-year sentence for molesting eight boys.<br/><br/>“When we were kids, the priests never did anything wrong. You didn’t question them, same as the police,” brother Jim Saviano told the AP. “There were many barriers put in his way intentionally and otherwise by institutions and generational thinking. That didn&#39;t stop him. That’s a certain kind of bravery that was unique.&quot;<br/><br/>A self-described “recovering Catholic,” Saviano went on to establish the New England chapter of the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, an organization working to bring specific allegations of clergy sexual abuse to light.<br/><br/>His faith in the church shattered, Saviano instead leaned on politicians and prosecutors to bring offenders to justice.<br/><br/>“We’re putting our faith in legislators and prosecutors to solve this problem,” he told reporters in 2002.<br/><br/>“Phil was an essential source during the Spotlight Team’s reporting on the cover-up of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church, providing other critical sources, research materials and the names of several accused priests,” said Mike Rezendes, a member of the Globe team that brought the scandal to light and a current AP investigative reporter.<br/><br/>“He also shared his own heartbreaking story of abuse, imbuing us with the iron determination we needed to break this horrific story,” Rezendes said. “During our reporting, and over the last 20 years, I got to know Phil well and have never met anyone as brave, as compassionate or as savvy.”<br/><br/>Saviano earned degrees in zoology and communications from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and Boston University and began working in hospital public relations. Later, he shifted to entertainment industry publicity and concert promotion, working closely with Collins, a lifelong friend and confidante, as well as Ella Fitzgerald, Mel Torme and other artists.<br/><br/>In 1991, he became seriously ill with AIDS and went public with his childhood abuse the following year, becoming one of the first survivors to come forward.<br/><br/>“Father Holley forced me and two of my friends to have repeated sexual contact with him,” Saviano said in an interview with the Globe — the first of many that would lead not only to criminal charges against the disgraced cleric but widespread prosecutions of others as the enormity of the scandal became evident.<br/><br/>By the early 2000s, Saviano was spending 10 hours a day on the phone with victims and journalists. He was an outspoken critic of the Vatican&#39;s reluctance to deal decisively with the fallout from the scandal. In 2008, when Pope Benedict XVI hinted to U.S. bishops during a visit that they&#39;d mishandled the church’s response, Saviano questioned the pontiff&#39;s decision to follow his remarks with Masses in New York and Washington.<br/><br/>“If he was really serious about the issue, that Mass would not be held in New York. It would be held here in Boston,&quot; he said.<br/><br/>In 2009, suffering kidney failure and unable to locate a match among family or friends, he found a donor after SNAP spread the word in a nationwide email to 8,000 clergy sex abuse survivors.<br/><br/>The abuse that came to light as a result of Saviano&#39;s work prompted Cardinal Law, Boston&#39;s highest-ranking churchman, to step down. The Globe&#39;s reporting showed Law was aware of child molesters in the priesthood but covered up their crimes and failed to stop them, instead transferring them from parish to parish without alerting parents or police.<br/><br/>When the archbishop died in Rome in 2017, Saviano asked bluntly: “How is he going to explain this when he comes face to face with his maker?”<br/><br/>In 2019, at the Vatican for an abuse prevention summit called convened by Pope Francis, <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/pope-francis-ap-top-news-international-news-united-states-latin-america-34df3ee878694c229c55bf1a5de533af"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; color: var(--linkLightColor); text-decoration: none; background-color: transparent; font-size: inherit; cursor: pointer; outline: none; font-family: &quot;AP Serif&quot;; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;"">Saviano said he told summit organizers to release the names of abusive priests around the world along with their case files</a>.<br/><br/>“Do it to launch a new era of transparency. Do it to break the code of silence. Do it out of respect for the victims of these men, and do it to help prevent these creeps from abusing any more children,&quot; he said.<br/><br/>Although there was a hard edge to much of his life, Saviano enjoyed traveling extensively and developed a soft spot for Indigenous art. In 1999, he launched an e-commerce website, Viva Oaxaca Folk Art, showcasing handmade decorative pieces he purchased on trips to southern Mexico and resold to collectors across the U.S.<br/><br/>He is survived by three brothers, Jim Saviano of Douglas; John Saviano of Douglas; and Victor Saviano of Boston; two nieces; and two nephews.

The idea that they would be precluded from voting is absurd,&quot; Galvin, a Democrat and the state&#39;s top elections official, <a href=""https://statehousenews.com/news/20211693"" style=""color: rgb(0, 106, 199); text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-skip-ink: none;"">said in September</a>.<br/><br/>In July, MassGOP Chair Jim Lyons told supporters the party was &quot;actively building a statewide infrastructure consisting of Republican activists&quot; who would work to put ballot questions dealing with voter ID, newborn care, and critical race theory education before voters next year.<br/><br/>The race education question and the newborn care question, which was filed in response to last year&#39;s expansion of state abortion access laws, failed Attorney General Maura Healey&#39;s constitutional review.<br/><br/>A judge <a href=""https://statehousenews.com/news/20211684"" style=""color: rgb(0, 106, 199); text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-skip-ink: none;"">later issued a preliminary injunction</a> allowing sponsors of the newborn proposal to collect signatures. Wakeman, who also served as an administrator for that campaign, said volunteers collected about 100,000 signatures but only got a bit more than 75,000 certified, falling short of the amount necessary to take another step toward the November 2022 ballot.<br/><br/>Wakeman said Bernadette Lyons, who chairs the Massachusetts Newborn Protection Coalition and is the wife of the MassGOP chair, filed a motion with the court seeking to keep the ballot question alive.<br/><br/>&quot;The hope for that is slim, but the hope is that we&#39;re able to continue the conversation with the Supreme Judicial Court over whether or not Maura Healey was justified in her ruling or not,&quot; Wakeman said. &quot;We believe that the question was simple and straightforward and that her ruling made it impossible for us to receive the correct amount of signatures.&quot;<br/><br/>A third question on which Wakeman worked, which sought to hamstring the state&#39;s participation in the Transportation Climate Initiative, is effectively moot and will not advance after Gov. Charlie Baker last month <a href=""https://statehousenews.com/news/20212127"" style=""color: rgb(0, 106, 199); text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-skip-ink: none;"">pulled the plug</a> on the plans.<br/><br/>With the field of 2022 ballot questions whittled down to just three topics, voters have a clearer sense of which issues will generate substantial debate -- and even more spending -- over the next year.<br/><br/>The app-based driver ballot question will build on an intense and expensive campaign cycle in California, where Uber, Lyft and DoorDash last year collectively spent more than $200 million successfully advocating for a similar measure known as Proposition 22.<br/><br/>Those three companies and Instacart are funding the Coalition for Independent Work pushing the Massachusetts ballot question, which <a href=""https://statehousenews.com/news/20211483"" style=""color: rgb(0, 106, 199); text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-skip-ink: none;"">would declare</a> all app-based drivers to be independent contractors and not employees -- a status that Healey alleges is a violation of existing state law -- and offer them access to some new benefits such as a pay floor and paid sick leave.<br/><br/>Officials for the coalition said they filed about 130,000 signatures for each of two versions of the question with local elections officials for certification, though it was unclear Wednesday how many the campaign then submitted to Galvin&#39;s office.<br/><br/>Members of the vocal opposition effort, which include U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and organized labor leaders, argue that the companies are trying to rewrite state law to support their business models at the expense of workers.<br/><br/>Another question on track for the ballot could feature major industry implications. The Massachusetts Package Store Association said it submitted more than 109,000 certified signatures on its question, <a href=""https://statehousenews.com/news/20212175"" style=""color: rgb(0, 106, 199); text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-skip-ink: none;"">which would double</a> the number of alcohol licenses a single company could hold but keep a cap in place.<br/><br/>The dental benefits question seeks to apply a profit limit on dental insurance companies similar to those in place on medical insurers, according to Mouhab Rizkallah, chairman of the ballot question committee.<br/><br/>Rizkallah, who would only answer questions via email, said medical insurers must pay at least 88 percent of the revenue they collect from premiums toward patient care but that a similar requirement does not exist for dental insurance providers, meaning that &quot;patients have to fight for coverage, and often quit due to exhaustion.&quot;<br/><br/>The proposal would require dental insurers to spend at least 83 percent of their dollars on &quot;dental expenses and quality improvements, as opposed to administrative expenses,&quot; according to its text.<br/><br/>Rizkallah said the campaign paid more than $500,000 on signature-gatherers and submitted 104,000 validated signatures with Galvin&#39;s office.<br/><br/>&quot;We are confident that this protective legislation will pass in Massachusetts, and it will then ricochet across the nation,&quot; Rizkallah wrote.<br/><br/>Rizkallah is an orthodontist himself who owns and operates six &quot;The Braces Places&quot; locations in the state. Separate from the ballot question, he is facing a lawsuit from Healey, who <a href=""https://www.mass.gov/news/ag-healey-sues-orthodontist-for-keeping-children-in-braces-longer-than-medically-necessary"" style=""color: rgb(0, 106, 199); text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-skip-ink: none;"">alleged in February</a> that Rizkallah kept children in braces for longer than necessary to submit false claims to MassHealth.

MPSA Executive Director Robert Mellion said his group hired Signature Drive at a rate of $5 to $8 per signature, while the Coalition for Independent Work did not provide details about the paid vendor it used.<br/><br/>Galvin&#39;s staff will process submissions in the coming weeks and count signatures. Later this month, officials will publish a list of which met the requirement of at least 80,239 signatures and transmit the petitions to the Legislature.<br/><br/>Lawmakers will then have until May 4, 2022 to act on each of the proposed laws. If they decline to do so, each campaign will need to collect another 13,374 signatures by July 6, 2022 to put the question before voters that November.<br/>",Chris Lisinski | State House News Service,Wed Dec 01 18:44:44 EST 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Charlie Baker&#39;s desk on Friday when both branches are scheduled to hold sessions.<br/><br/>About 15 hours after a conference committee filed their accord to spend a significant portion of federal American Rescue Plan Act funds and surplus state tax revenue, the House accepted the bill on an unrecorded voice vote and without debate during a lightly attended informal session.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1638478308710,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1638478308710,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-7731-dab0-a57d-ff3535ee0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-4e71-d9b9-a7fd-ce770de80003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-33d4-d9b9-a7fd-fbd63a6c0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-30db-d269-a3fd-befbf0a20001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-7cea-d269-a3fd-fefb69b4002d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-7cea-d269-a3fd-fefb69880000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>A Senate vote to accept the conference committee report (<a href=""https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/H4269"">H 4269</a>) is expected on Friday, and then final procedural votes could send the spending package to Baker.<br/><br/>Negotiators tasked with resolving differences between the underlying House and Senate spending bills (H 4234 / S 2580), both of which carried a bottom line of about $3.82 billion, announced an accord on Tuesday night and filed the 163-page legislation around 8 p.m. Wednesday.<br/><br/>Both the House and Senate met on Thursday, but the Senate adjourned until Friday without tackling the topic.<br/><br/>&quot;I think that there were members, particularly in the Senate, that wanted to have an opportunity to read through the bill and make sure that we didn&#39;t do it all today,&quot; said House Ways and Means Assistant Vice Chair Rep. Paul Donato.<br/><br/>&quot;I foresee that we&#39;ll be enacting it tomorrow,&quot; Donato told the News Service.<br/><br/>Legislative leaders had hoped to wrap up work on the bill by Thanksgiving, but needed a couple of extra weeks to reach consensus on a bill that has been eagerly anticipated by many stakeholders in line for a piece of the federal economic recovery aid.<br/><br/>The package would steer $500 million toward one-time bonus payments for lower-income essential workers who stayed on the job in-person during the state of emergency. It would also deposit $500 million into the unemployment insurance trust fund to relieve pressure on businesses who fund the system via taxes and had to absorb costs stemming from a wave of joblessness during the pandemic.<br/><br/>The bill features $530 million for housing initiatives, $400 million to expand access to mental and behavioral health supports and community-based primary care, $300 million for Medicaid home services, $260 million to support financially strained hospitals in areas particularly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and $200 million for local and regional public health systems.<br/><br/>&quot;This marks a major step forward in the effort to transform our dangerously inadequate and inequitable local public health system,&quot; said Maddie Ribble, director of public policy at the Massachusetts Public Health Association. The funding will move Massachusetts &quot;closer to a 21st-century local public health system that our state can be proud of,&quot; Ribble said, while urging lawmakers to also pass a bill creating minimum public health standards for every community.<br/><br/>The conference committee bulked up the spending package&#39;s bottom line by roughly $180 million over the base House and Senate versions. As redrafted, the bill would use all of the state&#39;s remaining fiscal 2021 tax surplus and would leave about $2.25 billion in ARPA funds remaining to be spent at a later date, according to House Ways and Means Committee Chair Rep. Aaron Michlewitz&#39;s office.<br/><br/>Baker pressed lawmakers in recent months to make swift use of the more than $5 billion Massachusetts state government received in ARPA funds, but legislative leaders instead opted to sweep the money into an account and decide its fate after a lengthy public hearing process.<br/><br/>Because the Legislature is in its seven-week holiday recess, both branches are meeting only in informal sessions, when a single member can halt any bill&#39;s movement by objecting. However, the original spending bills passed unanimously in both the House and Senate and the bill, which is laden with earmarked local spending, is not expected to encounter opposition.<br/><br/>While the bill sailed through without any dissent from representatives, the Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance criticized House leadership for advancing the measure during an informal session less than a full day after the conference committee filed its compromise.<br/><br/>&quot;No one would have ever thought that an elected body of 160 House lawmakers would be stripped of their responsibilities in order to appease a particular Speaker, but that&#39;s exactly what has happened,&quot; MassFiscal spokesperson Paul Craney said in a statement. &quot;Rank and file lawmakers need to ask themselves why they are even there if they are not even going to review budget items. The Massachusetts State House has been closed for over 600 days, and this is exactly the reason why -- leadership prefers it. Constituents have no way of observing the behind closed doors deliberations that occur to determine how their tax dollars are spent in the Massachusetts House of Representatives.&quot;<br/><br/>Calling it a &quot;big bill,&quot; Sen. Jason Lewis told the News Service Thursday that &quot;there&#39;s a lot of important appropriations in there, and we did want to just give senators a chance to read through it before the Senate takes it up tomorrow.&quot;<br/><br/>Lewis added: &quot;The Senate&#39;s plan is to take it up first thing in session tomorrow. ... And our plan is to get the bill onto the governor&#39;s desk before the end of the day tomorrow.&quot;<br/><br/><i>Chris Van Buskirk, Sam Doran and Michael P.

Article,"Unseen, part 5: Sex traffickers prey on drug-addicted young men","Unseen, part 5: Sex traffickers prey on drug-addicted young men","<i>Updated at 12 p.m. Dec. 13</i><br/><br/>Bruce Bemer made no secret of what his money could buy. The wealthy Connecticut businessman admitted to police and the FBI that he purchased sex from drug-addicted young men. But Bemer strenuously denied a far more serious charge: knowingly participating in a human trafficking operation.<br/><br/>Three months ago, the Connecticut Supreme Court agreed with the 68-year-old defendant — ruling unanimously that a lower court failed to prove he was aware of the trafficking operation that provided the young men he paid to perform sex acts. <br/><br/>Far more boys and young men are victims of commercial sexual exploitation than previously understood, a GBH News investigation has revealed, and the Connecticut case shows how difficult it is for prosecutors to hold alleged abusers accountable. It also points to how drug addiction and treatment facilities present key recruitment opportunities for predators, anti-trafficking advocates say.<br/><br/>It is believed that the traffickers who provided Bemer with young men operated for almost 30 years, according to a Danbury detective who was involved in the case. Robert King and William Trefzger preyed on emotionally damaged and troubled youth, often using their drug addictions to gain trust before turning them into sex workers.<br/><br/>The Connecticut high court’s decision shocked many in the state who have followed the case, but perhaps no one more than Lin Marino, whose son, Samuel, was one of the trafficking victims from whom Bemer purchased sexual acts.<br/><br/>“It removes any justice that we may have received for our son,’’ Marino told GBH News. “It was devastating news.”<br/><br/>Samuel died in a car crash in 2009 while being pursued by police after a carjacking, according to a police report. But his mother and others are convinced he took his own life by purposely crashing the car he was driving. <br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1639403739842,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1639403739842,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-b410-deb5-a77f-febaebaf0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-b410-dba8-a17f-f71edc280000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-b410-dba8-a17f-f71edc0d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">Samuel Marino poster</bsp-image><br/><h3>&#39;He was ashamed of being trafficked&#39;</h3><br/>Samuel Marino took chances. He excelled in snowboarding and loved nothing more than BMX biking. He broke a lot of bones doing what he loved. And after graduating Tolland High School in 2001, Samuel, who had a learning disability, built barns for a living, putting further strain on his body.<br/><br/>Lin Marino said he was often in pain. That led him to OxyContin, then heroin. Through tears, his mother recalled asking Samuel to leave the house.<br/><br/>He went to several rehabilitation centers, she said.<br/><br/>“Little did we know that every time he would come out of a rehab facility, they were waiting for him to readdict him so they could traffic him,” she said.<br/><br/>Samuel stayed at a Liberation House facility in Stamford for nearly six months, court records show. Nobody at the organization’s corporate headquarters could be reached for comment.<br/><br/>It was outside the rehab center in Stamford that Samuel met with Robert King and William Trefzger. <br/><br/>“Sam didn&#39;t have a chance,” his mother said. “Robert King picked him up out of his first rehab and told him he was going to be his sponsor, pretended he was a friend, and Sam&#39;s friend. And all the while he was readdicting my son, over and over — every time my son tried to get clean — so that he could use him for his own profit, to sex traffic him.”<br/><br/>For years, Marino and her husband, Michael, now deceased, were unaware of what had happened to their only son.

The judge handed down a 20-year sentence for which Bemer would have to serve 10 years. But he avoided prison altogether. After posting bail totaling $1.3 million, he was remanded to his Glastonbury home under house arrest while he appealed his conviction. Bemer declined a request for an interview through his attorney.<br/><br/>Robert King, 56, of Danbury, Connecticut, the purported leader of the sex trafficking ring, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit human trafficking and was sentenced to state prison in June 2019. In exchange for testifying against Bemer, his sentence of 20 years was suspended by the trial judge after he served four and a half years in prison. King was released several months ago with time served.<b> </b>Through his lawyer, Chris Duby, he declined to comment on this story.<br/><br/>A third defendant in the Connecticut case, William Trefzger, 77, pleaded guilty to patronizing a trafficked person in February 2018. He entered into a plea deal. In exchange for his testimony against King and Bemer, his 10-year sentence was suspended after one year served and 10 years of probation. <br/><br/>Trefzger, who admitted his role in targeting young men with drug addictions, became the first person convicted under a 2013 Connecticut human trafficking law. But he was never called to the stand by prosecutors to testify against King or Bemer. Telephone messages left at Trefzger’s home in Westport went unanswered. <br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1639234267911,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1639234267911,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-a9f9-deb5-a77f-effb44760001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-a9f9-d880-a9ff-bdff344c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-a9f9-d880-a9ff-bdff34310000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">Human Trafficking Ring</bsp-image><br/><br/>King’s drugs-for-sex enterprise began to unravel in January 2016 when workers at a group home in Torrington noticed him coming and going at all hours and signing a resident out of the facility.<br/><br/>Dan Trompetta of the Danbury Police, now retired, was the lead detective in the case. He told GBH News that he was contacted by a state probation officer who said King was prostituting one of her clients. She said King gave her client drugs and made him perform sex acts. <br/><br/>Seasoned investigators in court testimony said they were shocked by the extent of what they discovered and the impact on victims and their families. Investigators testified in the criminal trial that King checked at least one victim out of Connecticut Valley Hospital, a state-run psychiatric facility. The young man was sexually exploited and then returned to the facility, police said. <br/><br/>Trompetta said King would also find young men at group homes, sober houses, shelters and on the streets. He asked some of them to stay with him in a trailer park in Danbury, where he supplied them with a steady stream of drugs and alcohol.<br/><br/>“Most of them have had problems with substance abuse prior. Some had recovered, and King destroyed that,” Trompetta explained in an email. According to psychiatrists and depositions taken in civil hearings all of the young men targeted by the human trafficking ring suffered severe psychological problems including Samuel Marino. “He was a manic depressive, and I think this made him an easy target for this sex trafficking ring,” said his mother. <br/><br/>King’s trailer is situated off a two-lane road populated by industrial sites and abandoned work sheds. Police staked out the house for months.<b> </b>They made a move in June 2016 after an FBI agent spotted King chasing a young man who ran from the trailer, then hauling him back inside.<br/><br/>That led to a search warrant and King’s arrest, Trompetta explained. <br/><br/>Standing in front of the box-shaped home, Joel Faxon, a New Haven attorney representing some of the young men who were exploited in the Bemer case, said the virtual captivity King used on his victims was the closest thing he had seen to indentured servitude.<br/><br/>“He would load up the van with young men and bring them to a destination where they&#39;d have to perform sex acts in exchange for cash, and then the cycle would continue,” Faxon said. “They&#39;d have a drug debt, and then they&#39;d have a rent debt, and then they&#39;d have a room and board debt, and a food debt — and they&#39;d ultimately all have to perpetually be paying him off while they were trapped here.”<br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1639235044043,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1639235044043,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-aa04-deb5-a77f-eeaecd810001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-aa04-deb5-a77f-eeaebc9b0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-aa04-deb5-a77f-eeaebc700000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">A row of small, white trailers line a paved road.</bsp-image><h3>The buyer</h3><br/>The main beneficiary of the Connecticut trafficking ring was Bruce Bemer, prosecutors say, who had a reputation for getting what he wanted. The Glastonbury businessman built his career on inherited wealth. He owns a petroleum company, a motorcycle dealership and the New London-Waterford Speedbowl. <br/><br/>Bemer got the young men he wanted through intermediaries. One of these men agreed to speak exclusively with GBH News, but only under a pseudonym because he feared “what Bemer’s money can buy.” He said he served as a debt collector and a “fixer,” arranging for individuals to meet Bemer at various locations, including at his Glastonbury plant after hours. <br/><br/>Sitting in a restaurant just off Interstate 84 in East Hartford, “Scott” said he met Bemer at a popular outdoor gay cruising site in the 1990s that has long been paved over by roads and remade by gentrification. Scott said Bemer decided to have others procure his partners after he was robbed by a man he had met at the site.<br/><br/>“He gave me a description of what he liked.

His attorney, Robert M. Goldstein, informed us that Perry had turned down GBH News’ interview requests. <br/><br/>Perry was sentenced to two and a half years in the Suffolk House of Correction after pleading guilty to 15 counts of evidence tampering, 15 drug charges and six counts of sex for a fee. He was also ordered to give up his license to practice law. He was disbarred in 2020. Suffolk Superior Court Judge William F.

Little learned about the dangers of the streets as a homeless teen. He said drugs-for-sex operations targeting boys and young men are more common than people understand.<br/><br/>“I first met David Perry when I was in recovery in my late teens, and he was part of my recovery circles. He had this kind of cult-like aura to him where he would get very close, lean in — kind of uncomfortably close — when he was talking to you,” Little said. “He had a kind of a gaggle of boys or like a gaggle of young men that were always around him. He had run sober homes. So when the news came out about, you know, that he was basically trading sex acts for drugs, I wasn&#39;t surprised at all. I was disgusted, but I wasn&#39;t surprised.”<br/><br/>Little said these facilities can be prone to abuse. Sober homes proliferated nationally as the opioid crisis grew. Many are loosely regulated and poorly run, according to a 2019 three-part <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2019/05/06/sober-houses-in-a-gray-area-between-over-regulating-and-under-regulating"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>series</u></a> published by GBH News. <br/><br/>The Perry case was not the first instance of a sober home operator trading drugs for sex in Massachusetts. In August, the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department sued the operators of two such residences in Lynn and Boston, accusing the owner of demanding sexual favors from female residents in exchange for rent and drugs. The owner of the residence, Peter McCarthy of Dorchester, operated seven sober homes in the commonwealth. In 1992, he was convicted of indecent assault and battery and was required to register as a sex offender. <br/><br/>Such arrangements may be far from unusual, according to Massachusetts Attorney General Healey,<b> </b><br/><br/>“Treatment centers and sober homes, which are a critical part in the recovery journey for so many, have been targeted by traffickers looking to identify people with substance use disorder and exploit their vulnerabilities with the promise of drugs, food and a roof over their head in exchange for commercial sexual activity,” Healey said.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1643206181813,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1643206181813,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;Read more of Unseen&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000178-9274-d798-a1fa-def4b9110000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a110002&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000178-db18-d908-a1f9-fbdb7e170000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a110002&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-87e8-dd7d-a57b-87e8b0eb0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-4733-d44d-a57c-67ff48ef0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a110002&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-a145-d9b9-a7fd-eb57c56a0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-c8ca-deb6-a3fd-ebcfb4db0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-aa1b-de37-ad7f-ba1b353d001b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-aa1b-de37-ad7f-ba1b345e0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Michael Jones, executive director of the Massachusetts Alliance for Sober Housing, a nongovernmental accrediting organization, said Perry’s sober houses were not registered and not certified. Only 177 of an estimated 350 sober houses in Massachusetts are registered and regularly inspected, Jones said.<br/><br/>“We would urge them to register, so that we know what&#39;s going on inside those homes,” he said, adding that he wants the state to do more to guarantee compliance.<br/><br/>GBH News asked the state Bureau of Substance Addiction Services about Jones&#39; concern but received no response. <br/><br/>In Connecticut, the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services also does not monitor, certify or oversee sober living homes. <br/><br/>David Perry pleaded guilty in 2019 to charges of evidence tampering, conspiracy to distribute illegal drugs, possession of illegal substances, and six counts of sex for a fee. <b> </b>Perry was never charged with human trafficking. It is a charge that can be difficult to prove.<br/><h3>A conviction unravels</h3><br/>Upon his conviction in 2019, Bruce Bemer’s attorney, Ryan Barry, brought together a team of highly experienced lawyers to argue his appeal. <br/><br/>Bemer was tried under a human trafficking statute passed by the Connecticut Legislature in 2013. Like the federal law, the accused is deemed guilty if they use fraud, force or coercion or knowingly engage in sex with a person under 18. <br/><br/>One of Bemer’s lawyers was Joette Katz," a former associate justice of the Connecticut Supreme Court and former commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Children and Families. Katz had sat on various anti-human trafficking panels and has<a href=""""https://www.law.com/ctlawtribune/2020/12/29/victims-of-sex-trafficking-deserve-fairness-in-preserving-dignity/?slreturn=20211019120719"""" style=""""text-decoration:none;""""> <u>written</u></a> on the topic. But Barry", who recruited Katz to the legal team, said she was convinced Bemer’s case did not fall within the bounds of human trafficking.<br/><br/>A Danbury Superior Court jury in 2019 found Bemer guilty of four prostitution-related charges and one trafficking crime. But on Sept. 29 this year, the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled that there was no evidence to demonstrate that Bemer knew the boys he exploited were trafficked or underage. <br/><br/>Bemer also strenuously denied any knowledge that the young men being supplied to him were addicted or intellectually challenged. <br/><br/>“I believe he knew,” said his former fixer, Scott.<br/><br/>But there are major challenges to proving human trafficking, said Jane Anderson," a former Miami prosecutor now working for <a href=""""https://aequitasresource.org/"""" style=""""text-decoration:none;""""><u>AEquitas</u></a>", a national legal nonprofit focused on intimate partner abuse, sexual violence and human trafficking. Anderson said the legal threshold for a sex trafficking conviction in Connecticut is much higher because the state statute importantly does not mirror the federal law in allowing “simple buyers” to be charged with trafficking. A section of the state law requires that the accused “<i>knowingly</i> compels or induces another person to engage in conduct involving sexual contact with one or more third persons” — phrasing that bolstered Bemer’s claim of ignorance.<br/><br/>Further complicating that burden of proof, Anderson said, are cases involving male victims and the fact that the element of sex for drugs does not automatically entail force or coercion. Some courts “would not understand that a male buyer would have any knowledge that the male was being forced or coerced,” she said.<br/><br/>Attorney Ryan Barry questions why trafficking charges were brought against only two of King’s clients, Bemer and Trefzger. King had also supplied boys and young men to at least eight different upper-middle class clients, including a local dentist, a Hartford lawyer and a Springfield, Mass., businessman, according to court records. Barry says Bemer’s wealth and prominence made him an ideal prosecution target. <br/><br/>“To go after a guy in Glastonbury who&#39;s a good, law-abiding citizen. There may be something else there,” Barry said, questioning whether state prosecutors were hoping to use the Bemer case to win a high-profile prosecution under the new human trafficking statute. <br/><br/>State attorney Sharmese L. Hodge, who tried the case, did not return phone calls from GBH News.<br/><br/>Bemer set aside $25 million of his fortune to settle lawsuits brought by 14 of 15 known victims. The most recent lawsuit was filed in July by attorney Faxon against Bemer in Connecticut Superior Court on behalf of a John Doe plaintiff “for repeated sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, sexual assault and human trafficking” that Bemer is alleged to have perpetrated when the plaintiff was a child.<br/><br/>Bemer’s legal representative said the lawsuits are opportunistic and unmerited.<br/><br/>But Lin Marino, who in 2019 resolved a lawsuit with Bemer on behalf of her son, said she would trade all the money she received to have him back. She said the state’s high court failed her family and others.<br/><br/>Marino said she hopes the tragedy that still consumes her daily life will serve as a warning to government officials, legislators, law enforcement and the operators of group and drug recovery homes to take the trafficking of young males seriously. She says she goes to trafficking events and donates money in the hope of making sure other young men do not end up like Samuel. <br/><br/>“I will go around to sex trafficking awareness events and talk about the fact that the trafficking of young men and boys is so underreported,” she said. <br/><br/>“I will never get over the death of my son, but this is one of the ways I am trying to heal.”<br/><br/><i>Correction: This story was updated to correct where the Coca-Cola bottles were found.

The students are fed up.”<br/><br/>Several buildings on Lesley’s historic campus have required maintenance and repair over the last semester, and accommodations have been made after students filed complaints about broken laundry machines, spoiled or expired food and unavailable school shuttles. The university said the students&#39; complaints are not indicative of systemic issues at the school.<br/><br/>Several students alleged they experienced sickness after consuming rotten food or undercooked meats provided by food contractor Aramark. Lesley students echoed <a href=""https://simmonsvoice.com/12328/news/studentsallegeunsafedietaryoptions/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">similar complaints made by Simmons students</a>, who created a petition in November to end the school’s contract with the food service provider. A spokesperson for Lesley said that university personnel work closely with Aramark employees to ensure that food standards are met, and denied claims of a larger systemic issue. <br/><br/>“While we are working closely with a group of students to discuss their concerns and our steps to address them — including issues we have experienced this fall with our laundry and transportation services — we can unequivocally confirm that these are isolated issues and there are no systemic issues around fundamental services,” a Lesley spokesperson told GBH News in a statement. “We look forward to ongoing dialogue as we continue to make progress on resolving these issues effectively and with urgency.”<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1639095127186,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1639095127186,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;Related Stories:&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-73e4-dab0-a57d-fff53d580003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-377f-d887-adfb-77ff91400000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000175-333d-d753-a37f-b3bd59650003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-a1ad-d9b9-a7fd-ebbf382d0029&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-a1ad-d9b9-a7fd-ebbf35930000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>Throughout the fall semester, the university asked students to be patient as it coped with ongoing supply chain issues that affected students’ meal plans, a $3,450-per-semester mandatory plan for all on-campus students. <br/><br/>“We are faced with unprecedented shortages of food and packaging materials, massive delays and cancellations of deliveries by our vendors, and unpredictable substitutions of items with different products by our vendors,” <a href=""https://lesley.edu/students/health-wellness-safety/coronavirus-disease/fall-2021-plan/meals"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">a notice posted</a> on the Lesley website reads. <br/><br/>In a petition created last week, students demanded that meals be made available seven days a week in both campus dining halls, and that “meals must all be edible … fully cooked, at appropriate temperature, free of mold, and within date of expiration.” <br/><br/>In response to the petition, on-duty chefs are also now required to send photos of labelling and menus to managers for approval “to eliminate potential onsite errors when food supply changes necessitate last minute menu changes,” university President Janet L. Steinmayer wrote in a note to students on Tuesday. In addition, the university has partnered with GrubHub to allow for free delivery of takeout meals for all students, faculty and staff, and “grab and go” meals are provided when the Washburn dining hall — one of two dining halls on campus — is not staffed. Rides from campus safety can also be arranged for students who wish to dine in the cafeteria across campus. <br/><br/>“When we experimented with providing more extensive dinner services on South Campus,” Steinmayer wrote, “the result was a large amount of food waste.” <br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1639150092838,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1639150092838,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-a1a7-d269-a3fd-bfbfa0760002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;Lesley sophomore Él Martinez holds a sign at a protest demanding better living conditions at the university&amp;#39;s three Cambridge campuses, Thursday, Dec. 9, 2021&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-a4f3-d0ab-a17d-eeff8d720000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-a4f3-d0ab-a17d-eeff8d490000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">A protester holds a sign reading &quot;Lesley lies&quot; outside a residential building.

Repairs on broken sinks in one dorm have been delayed until after the end of the semester, and the university is providing bottled water to accommodate students in that dorm, according to a Lesley spokesperson. <br/><br/>Lesley University is in the process of a large-scale transition, <a href=""https://lesley.edu/about/lesley-campus-plan"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">announced last fall</a>, that includes renovations of dorms and other academic buildings across the school’s three campuses, using funds from the sale of underutilized or vacant buildings on the 16-acre campus in Cambridge. Focus group meetings about the proposal are ongoing, and include student perspectives, according to a Lesley spokesperson. <br/><br/>“In this campus plan, they talk about doing renovations and making changes and investing money into the campus,” Martinez said. “But that should have happened before students moved in and didn&#39;t have access to these very critical necessities.” <br/><br/>Maggie Zecker, a 20-year-old junior political science major, says the university took five weeks to fix a broken radiator in her room. “I purchased a heated blanket and sucked it up for a little while,” Zecker told GBH News on Thursday. “Portable heaters are not allowed in dorms either, so that made it a little bit difficult.” <br/><br/>In her letter to students, Steinmayer recommended that on-campus residents submit work orders regarding issues with hot water, noting that “unfortunately, with the current supply chain issues that are out of our control, if a part is needed for a repair, it may take a bit longer than we would like.” <br/><br/>Sophomore photography student Grace Madonna, 20, says her on-campus friends have come to her Cambridge apartment to shower on multiple occasions when hot water was unavailable in their dorms. Though she lives off-campus, Madonna says she has experienced difficulty accessing academic buildings and labs for her work, and expressed concern about security on campus.<br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1639095007437,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1639095007437,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-a1ab-dab0-a57d-efbfa3f70001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-a1ab-dab0-a57d-efbf955e0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-a1ab-dab0-a57d-efbf953a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">IMG_7984.jpg</bsp-image><br/>“We have asked multiple times to have around-the-clock security because the [photography lab] is open from eight a.m. to midnight, but we&#39;ve only had security from about seven to 10 p.m., despite multiple asks for longer hours.” <br/><br/>Security is provided 24/7 with officers on each campus, and the university is working on providing a phone app to make reporting incidents more convenient for students, according to Lesley Chief Operations Officer Joanne Kossuth. <br/><br/>The university is also in the process of creating a web dashboard for COVID-19 information, Kossuth told GBH News in an email Thursday. Periodic updates are also provided to the community via email, and contact tracing and testing are provided by Cataldo Ambulance Service, which conducts weekly testing for vaccinated members of the on-campus university community and twice per week for people with vaccine exemptions. Since August, five residents, three commuters and three on-campus employees have tested positive for COVID-19, according to Kossuth. <br/><br/>After multiple complaints about non-functional laundry machines provided by a laundry vendor the school “isn’t happy with,” laundry services will be provided for free in the spring semester, and the school is actively looking for another laundry vendor, according to Kossuth. <br/><br/>Approximately 6,000 students are enrolled at Lesley, paying an annual tuition of $51,170 before aid, according to the U.S. Dept. of Education.

Deval Patrick calls on Biden to support kids who lost parents to COVID-19,"Jennifer Wiles has met a lot of children who have lost a parent to COVID-19.<br/><br/>&quot;I know a little girl who is eight years old, whose mother was diagnosed with COVID, and she had a really rapid decline,&quot; said Wiles, the director of children&#39;s services for the hospice and palliative care program at Beth Israel Lahey Health. <br/><br/>Like many who have lost a loved one in this pandemic, the girl wasn&#39;t able to say goodbye in person. She just had an iPad with a poor connection.<br/><br/>&quot;Not a final hug. Not a final holding of the hand. Just on the iPad,&quot; she said. <br/><br/>A new <a href=""https://www.covidcollaborative.us/initiatives/hidden-pain"">report</a> released last week by the <a href=""https://www.covidcollaborative.us/"">COVID Collaborative</a>, a national advisory group on the pandemic co-chaired by former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, found that more than 167,000 children in the United States have lost a parent or caregiver to COVID-19. That&#39;s one out of every 450 kids. The report says that includes more than 2,000 kids in Massachusetts. <br/><br/>Patrick and his coalition are calling on President Joe Biden to lead a coordinated effort to identify the children who need support and meet the wide range of social and emotional needs they face.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1639425072999,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-e4be-dadb-a77e-f5be3b2c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1639425072999,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-e4be-dadb-a77e-f5be3b2c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-591f-dcca-a1fe-59df713c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000179-d2d2-d872-a5f9-f3d3b1780003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000175-beb5-d944-a9fd-fef542b00003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000172-0f61-d5a0-af72-6f75a4010003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-b556-dba8-a17f-f75eb3ff000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-b556-dba8-a17f-f75eb1c30000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>&quot;When it comes to children, focusing on meeting their needs and doing so promptly, we think, is critical,&quot; Patrick told GBH News.<br/><br/>Those needs include counseling, and in some cases, intense therapy, Patrick said.<br/><br/>&quot;Many need very basic services around health and housing and food,&quot; he said. &quot;These are children, 70 percent of them 13 years old or younger, and they don&#39;t know how to advocate for themselves. And they don&#39;t always have adults who can do so for them.&quot;<br/><br/>Knowing what kind of help is available and how to access it is complicated, Patrick said. A program led by the White House could help make those connections, by screening to identify kids who have lost a parent at doctors’ appointments, creating school-based interventions to support them where they are and strengthening existing social services. <br/><br/>The report&#39;s recommendations include the creation of a unified fund to address those needs, particularly for the 13,000 children who lost their only caregiver, that would go to financial assistance and mental health support.<br/><br/>&quot;That was the case after the [Boston] Marathon bombing,&quot; Patrick said. &quot;Having one central place where resources were pooled and where decisions could be made quickly, I think was incredibly important.

The first part, she said, focuses on remembering and honoring the person who has died.<br/><br/>&quot;That&#39;s important, to keep saying their name, to keep talking about memories and different experiences that they have had with this person,&quot; she said. &quot;The second part is to realize that no one is alone in grief. And that is part of our mission, too, that no young person should have to grieve alone. With peer support models, with the camp, with all of our programs, people have the opportunity to see that there are other people who have experienced something similar to them.&quot;<br/><br/>The kids are also armed with information about what grief is, the emotions that it can cause, and how to express those emotions, &quot;so that kids can draw within themselves their own strengths to cope with with grief,&quot; she said. &quot;And I think in doing so, we really promote resiliency and hope. We really confirm the courage, the kindness, the compassion that is within all of them to cope.&quot;<br/>",Craig LeMoult,Mon Dec 13 18:32:29 EST 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She said Charail Premdas was a young man who struggled with mental health issues for most of his life, and he fell through the cracks. <br/><br/>Premdas suffered a medical emergency during breakfast on Dec. 5. “Officers observed what appeared to be a seizure suffered by Mr. Premdas, who then became unresponsive,” said spokesperson Peter Van Delft in a statement to GBH News.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1639518218391,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-62e6-dde0-ad63-fbf6275a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1639518218391,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-62e6-dde0-ad63-fbf6275a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-2e07-d82a-af7c-efdf0dfe0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000016d-ae61-d52b-ab6d-fe7770350003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000179-1ecc-ddcd-a57f-fffd6bb70003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-bae3-d91e-a3fd-fefb32ee002d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-bae3-d91e-a3fd-fefb32b30000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>Jail staff immediately began attending to Premdas and employed the use of an automated external defibrillator as part of the emergency assessment process, according to Van Delft. Emergency Medical Services also tried to resuscitate him, and transported him to Massachusetts General Hospital where he died shortly after 8 a.m.<br/><br/>Premdas had been held at the jail since Oct. 19 on an aggravated assault charge out of Boston Municipal Court. He was incarcerated at Suffolk County Jail, where he was being held on $500 bail until his scheduled trial next week. <br/><br/>The Suffolk County Sheriff&#39;s Office, led by Sheriff Steven Tompkins, said foul play is not suspected and an investigation into Premdas’ cause of death is being conducted. Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins’ office has been notified.<br/><br/>Gail Premdas was told her son died later on Dec. 5. She found out from Massachusetts General Hospital that in November, after Charail was admitted to jail, he received in-patient care at the hospital and was diagnosed with an enlarged heart. She said the sheriff’s office did not inform her of the hospital stay or diagnosis.<br/><br/>“Was that true? I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m waiting for the autopsy to come back. Did he actually have a seizure before he fell out? I don&#39;t know. He&#39;s never had seizures,” she said. &quot;Did he get ahold of some drugs in jail? Did someone give him something? Was it the fact that his heart was too large and it was badly damaged? I don’t know.&quot;<br/><br/>The 71-year-old mother recently went to Nashua Steet Jail to pick up her son’s belongings. She said she was told homicide was also investigating the matter, but it was routine.<br/><br/>She was hoping her son’s case would be dismissed and she could have him civilly committed so that he could get the behavioral health services he needed.<br/><br/>His mother explained that Charail&#39;s life was not easy. Before his incarceration, he had been homeless in Boston. He had a son, and his daughter died at birth. He also struggled with substance abuse and mental health issues.<br/><br/>“There&#39;s not enough services for that. I can attest to that,” said Gail Premdas. “But he was kind. I would hear him, when he would call me up and then ask for people to give change. I would hear him say &#39;thank you.&#39; He still had some manners about him — he was just a totally lost soul out there.” <br/><br/>Premdas, who works in mental health services, said her son “fell through the cracks” for years.<br/><br/>Charail Premdas is the latest person to die in custody at the Suffolk County Sheriffs’ Office. Rashonn Wilson, Ayesha Johnson, Edward &quot;Jay&quot; Isberg Jr. and Carl &quot;Chuck&quot; Rabouin all died at Suffolk County facilities between July and September 2021. The causes of death in those cases have not been publicly released.<br/><br/>According to a public records request shared on MuckRock, a service dedicated to government transparency, there were three deaths total from 2019-2020 in Suffolk County custody. There has been little information from Tompkins’ office explaining the recent uptick. <br/><br/>GBH News left messages with Wellpath, the medical provider for the Suffolk County Sheriff’s Office, which were not returned. <br/><br/><i>This story was updated to include comments from Gail Premdas.</i>",Sarah Betancourt,Tue Dec 14 17:07:32 EST 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,Worcester bans use of controversial facial recognition technology ,Worcester bans use of controversial facial recognition technology ,"Worcester has become the eighth municipality in Massachusetts to bar government agencies from acquiring or using facial recognition technology. <br/><br/>The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to pass the ordinance, citing the technology&#39;s <a href=""https://www.nist.gov/speech-testimony/facial-recognition-technology-frt-0"">documented flaws</a> when it comes to identifying people of color as well as a desire to rebuild trust in the community. Worcester joins a growing list of cities to take this action, joining Boston, Brookline, Cambridge, Easthampton, Northampton, Springfield and Somerville — as well as other major cities around the country, including San Francisco and New Orleans.<br/><br/>“The current technology has been shown to be inconsistent,” said Worcester City Councilor Khrystian King. “It’s been shown to disproportionately impact people of color, Black men and Black women in specificity.

He said the point of the ordinance, which was part of a series of reforms promoted by the city manager, was to send a message. <br/><br/>“The impetus really was trying to improve and enhance our public safety efforts. And communities of color and other segments of our community need to make sure that we rebuild trust. And one way you do that is make sure technology used is well vetted and has requisite oversight,” King said. <br/><br/>The ACLU of Massachusetts is fighting for just the kind of oversight that King is talking about.<br/><br/>“There are a lot of ways to get bad guys today,” said Kade Crockford, director of the Technology for Liberty Program at the ACLU of Massachusetts. “We live in the golden era of surveillance for police. The crucial difference, though, between the cellphone that is commonplace in law enforcement now and the use of biometric identifiers to track everywhere we go and everything we do and everyone we associate with … is that I can leave my phone at home, but I can’t leave my face.” <br/><br/>And, Crockford said, police need to ask a judge for a warrant to prove that the information is needed. She said a facial recognition system would be entirely under the control of the police.<br/><br/>Crockford points to at least three recent cases in the United States where Black men were arrested based on being misidentified by facial recognition, and one case in Michigan where a 14-year-old Black girl was barred from a roller skating rink because recognition technology used by a private security company wrongly deemed her a safety risk.<br/><br/>The ACLU and other detractors concede there are areas where facial recognition can be effective. The Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles, for example, has been using the technology since 2006 to combat identity fraud. <br/><br/>&quot;Facial recognition is the most precise way to protect access to anything... There&#39;s a chance in a million that somebody wrongfully gains access to whatever the facial recognition can protect,&quot; said Richard Carriere, senior vice president and general manager of CyberLink, a company that makes facial recognition software called FaceMe Security.<br/><br/>Carriere said facial recognition is nearly 100% accurate when used the way his company intends it to be used — which is to protect against identity theft — regardless of a person&#39;s skin complexion, gender or ethnicity. He pointed out that iPhones&#39; Face ID feature works for everyone. &quot;Of course there&#39;s always risk, there&#39;s one in a million; in poor lighting conditions someone who has a darker skin will be more difficult, or if it&#39;s extremely bright someone who has fair skin [will have trouble],&quot; he said.<br/><br/>And Carriere was adamant that most companies like his do not condone the use of their technology without the consent of the people being watched, which is how facial recognition is often used by police and other authorities. <br/><br/>&quot;Using people&#39;s data without consent, that&#39;s a problem,&quot; Carriere said, &quot;[but] that&#39;s an application of the technology, it&#39;s not the technology. Just like there&#39;s several applications to the pen, one of which is stronger than the cannon,&quot; he added.",Aaron Schachter,Wed Dec 15 16:27:39 EST 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The districts emphasized that they were not aware of any specific or credible threats to their schools, but that they were still taking it seriously. <br/><br/>The messages originated from Natick, Holliston, Belmont, Cambridge and Cohasset.

The home serves a handful of young men and transgender women. Last week, Williams said he’s already planning to expand. With the help of a $10 million grant from the Texas Legislature, he is purchasing another multi-acre property to increase the number of beds.<br/><br/>“This is an epidemic,’’ said Williams, 63. “The myth is it doesn&#39;t happen to boys. But we know it happens to boys in every city, in every state, across this country, every day.”<br/><br/>Williams is the founder of a nonprofit called Ranch Hands Rescue, which connects traumatized people with abused and neglected animals as part of a therapeutic process. The safe home, surrounded by an 8-foot cedar fence, also is home to a ragtag batch of rescued animals, including a limping horse, a formerly neglected alpaca and a gaggle of once abandoned chickens. <br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1640006307900,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1640006307900,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;migration.alignment&quot;:&quot;RIGHT&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-c916-deb6-a3fd-eb9f8d150001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;Landon Dickeson, director of clinical services at Ranch Hands Rescue, pets Midnite the horse at the facility in Argyle, Texas, on Dec. 7.

Roxbury Youthworks’ BUILD is the only program in Massachusetts focusing solely on male, nonbinary and transgender victims of commercial sexual exploitation. For many of the people Collins helps, their only housing options are couch-surfing or homeless shelters. <br/><br/>“I think it should set a precedent for other states,’’ said Collins, also a life coach at BUILD. “Stable housing and stable care directed towards these youth helps stop commercial sexual exploitation.”<br/><br/>An increasingly vocal group of male trafficking survivors like Alfaro and William are driving efforts to increase resources for male sex trafficking victims.

Procopio has been working for about a decade to create more awareness about male trafficking victims, sometimes facing pushback from other advocates.<br/><br/>“I’m getting very emotional,’’ said Procopio, who in 2014 founded the nonprofit BUILD. “It brings to light that this topic for trafficked boys is finally getting the recognition it needs, all the way to the federal level.”<br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1639755432083,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1639755432083,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-c908-d982-a77d-e95aba230001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-c907-deb6-a3fd-eb8fc5a30000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-c907-deb6-a3fd-eb8fc5890000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">An older man sits in a green Adirondack chair in a grassy park lined with trees.</bsp-image><br/><br/>There’s no definitive data to detail numbers of trafficking or commercially sexually exploited victims in the United States. But one 2016 national <a href=""https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/7187110-Youth-Involvement-in-the-Sex-Trade-3#document/p10/a580473"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">study</a> found more than a third of young people involved in the U.S. sex trade were boys and young men. That same year, a federal <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20500520-resources-sop-data-collection-2016#document/p53/a2021179"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">study</a> found a third of male youths experiencing homelessness said they traded sex for something of value — putting their number in the thousands nationwide on any given night.<br/><br/>Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey told GBH News last week that trafficking crimes against “male, transgender, and LGBTQ victims are significantly underreported and often go undetected.” She said, “This is something that we as a state, and as a society, must work to address – through training and outreach, public awareness, and victim resources – so we can get them the support they need and deserve.”<br/><br/>Some anti-trafficking advocates like Nikki Bell, founder of the Worcester-based nonprofit Living in Freedom Together, offer no apologies for focusing on women’s needs first. The organization runs two shelters for prostituted women: one for women struggling with substance use and mental health disorders, and the other for those seeking immediate shelter. She says their day program welcomes boys for services but the shelters are reserved for women, including trans women. Bell, who also is a trafficking survivor, doesn’t believe studies that show a significant proportion of male victims. <br/><br/>“It feels sometimes like girls and women cannot even be victimized without people being like, ‘Well, what about men? What about boys?’’’ she said. “It&#39;s an issue predominantly affecting women and girls.”<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1643206207366,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1643206207366,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;Read more of Unseen&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000178-9274-d798-a1fa-def4b9110000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a110002&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000178-db18-d908-a1f9-fbdb7e170000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a110002&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-87e8-dd7d-a57b-87e8b0eb0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-4733-d44d-a57c-67ff48ef0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a110002&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-a145-d9b9-a7fd-eb57c56a0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-c8ca-deb6-a3fd-ebcfb4db0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-c911-dc47-a77f-fbb5c02d000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-c911-dc47-a77f-fbb5bf400000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>But others want to make sure all genders feel supported. The Boston-based anti-trafficking program for youth, My Life My Choice, plans on replacing its current <a href=""https://www.mylifemychoice.org/"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">website</a> — featuring three women and the headline, “Her strength. Our Power” — with something gender-neutral. <br/><br/>Lisa Goldblatt Grace, executive director of the program, said currently only about eight of the 200 youth the program serves are cisgender boys, meaning their male gender matches the sex they were assigned at birth. About 40 percent of their youth identify as “LGBTQ plus,” she said. But the organization wants to make sure all young people feel welcome.<br/><br/>“We&#39;re working really hard to ensure that all of the young people that we serve, of all gender identities, all gender expressions, feel affirmed, validated, supported, safe, getting services, choosing to get services with us,’’ she said. <br/><br/>Trafficked minors in Massachusetts can seek shelter through the Department of Children and Families. The state is currently<a href=""https://www.commbuys.com/bso/external/bidDetail.sdo?docId=BD-21-1034-0009-DSS09-58737&amp;external=true&amp;parentUrl=close"" style=""text-decoration:none;""> working</a> to create group homes specifically tailored to exploited youth. And last spring, DCF launched trainings for social workers to help them support foster parents who may be caring for trafficked children of all genders. <br/><br/>But for now, there are few clear paths for help for trafficked young men in Massachusetts or across the nation. In Texas, Bob Williams wants to fill the gap. <br/><br/>“I was shocked that there wasn&#39;t a facility or a safe house,” Williams said during a three-hour interview earlier this month on the Texas property he transformed from an office space to include a safe home. “I thought, I can fix that.”<br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1639755560377,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1639755560377,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-c90a-d91e-a3fd-cddbb5690001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-c90a-deb6-a3fd-eb8f79c40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-c90a-deb6-a3fd-eb8f79ab0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">An older man with glasses and a ten-gallon hat pets a horse&#39;s head while looking out over a pen with two sheep.</bsp-image><br/>Gray-haired and bestacled, wearing a black ten-gallon hat, Williams says he is taking on this project because of his lived experience. <br/><br/>Williams says he was raped at the age of 17 and, unable to process the pain, became addicted to drugs and homeless. He felt everything had been taken from him and he didn’t care what happened. By 20, he was trading sex for shelter. Under federal law, any child who trades sex for something of value is considered a trafficking victim. Adults are considered trafficked if they are “induced by force, fraud or coercion.”<br/><br/>Williams understands now that he was a trafficking victim — something he didn’t comprehend until after he changed his life around. Years later, he got clean and sober and started working for Motorola, where he eventually became a sales executive. In 2007, he suffered a stroke and retired.<br/><br/>Williams was inspired to help animals, and later people, after coming across a goat stuck in a cage at an open-air market, unable to walk or turn around. Concerned about its welfare, he purchased it for $60. He placed the goat in the back seat of his Cadillac and brought it home. <br/><br/>He said he told the story to one of his closest friends, now deceased actress and philanthropist Doris Roberts, best known for her work on the TV show “Everybody Loves Raymond.” Roberts helped him raise money to create an animal sanctuary. As Williams cared for a growing crew of recovering farm animals, he found his own health was getting better. <br/><br/><b>“</b>I would say to Doris, ‘These animals are having an impact on me, they&#39;re helping me,’’’ he said. “So I wanted to design a program for people.”<br/><br/>He lobbied mental health professionals to help him. For months, he was told his plan wouldn’t work, that healthy animals were the only answer. Eventually, he persuaded a local counselor and an advocacy agency to bring a pilot group of troubled children to interact with his traumatized animals — and they were encouraged by the results. Ranch Hands Rescue was officially incorporated in 2009 and now boasts that it has cared for 579 animals and 1,710 clients, including trafficked boys, girls and veterans.<br/><br/>Roberts, who died in 2016, was an avid supporter of his fundraising efforts. “It’s a new way of life for these children and these animals,’’ she said tearfully in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUWOI-pzZUU"">a short promotional film from 2014</a>. “Let’s help them make it a wonderful life.’’ <br/><br/>When Williams decided to create a residential program, he said he first thought of veterans. But then, he said, he realized through conversations and research that trafficked young men had nowhere to go. When Ranch Hands Rescue staff began working from home because of the pandemic, he realized he could convert the organization’s headquarters into a safe home.<br/><br/>He said there’s an appalling lack of data on trafficking numbers altogether. Women and girls also need more help, he said, “But the reality is that somebody&#39;s got to do something about the boys.”<br/><br/>Recently, residents, staff and volunteers at Bob’s House of Hope helped decorate a Christmas tree, hang stockings and put up other holiday decorations. A sign reading, “Santa please stop here,” hangs on the wall. <br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1639755695175,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1639755695175,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-c90c-deb6-a3fd-eb8dd84a0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-c90c-deb6-a3fd-eb8dc8af0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-c90c-deb6-a3fd-eb8dc8950000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">Four stockings hang above windows that face a parking area. A sign shaped like a downward arrow reads &quot;Santa please stop here&quot;</bsp-image><br/>Williams introduced a reporter to several of the residents, asking two of them to show off their singing abilities, while protecting their anonymity due to fear of the men who trafficked them. <br/><br/>Landon Dickeson, director of clinical services at the home, said organizers are learning every day how to better do their work. It isn’t enough to replicate what happens at women’s shelters, he said. For one thing, the clients at Bob’s eat a lot more. <br/><br/>Residents also struggle with mental illness, substance abuse, health issues and trust deficiencies. Not one has more than a seventh-grade education. They have serious dental care needs and most hoard food, unaccustomed to a plentiful kitchen. But every once in a while, there is song, there is laughter, and there is hope for self-sustaining lives. <br/><br/>“I want my focus to be helping people recover from complex trauma — not just trauma, not just PTSD, but complex PTSD — and those who have tried everything else and still not gotten better,’’ Dickeson said. “What more can you ask for? People helping animals, animals helping people? That&#39;s perfect.”<br/><br/>With his multi-acre purchase, Williams is planning to accommodate more trafficking survivors. He said he could use 20 more beds today. He knows it won’t solve the national trafficking problem. The country also needs to better educate people about trafficking and hold traffickers and sex buyers accountable. <br/><br/>Until then, Bob’s House of Hope wants to be a beacon for those who need help. <br/><br/>“I knew if we built it, they would come, and we can&#39;t even keep up with the calls,’’ Williams said. “My goal is to eventually be able to take young men from anywhere in the world.” <br/>","Jenifer B.

The situation also brought up the need for families and schools to talk with children about social media and threats of violence. <br/> <br/>“I&#39;ve heard both parents saying ‘I&#39;m not taking any risks, I&#39;m not sending my student in today,’ or students themselves at the high school age saying, ‘You know, I&#39;m not taking any risks either,’” said Jessica Tang, president of the Boston Teachers Union.<br/> <br/>Boston Public Schools said about three-quarters of kids came to school Friday, down 12% from attendance the day before.<br/> <br/>Tang said educators were concerned as well.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1639781542205,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1639781542205,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-b968-d91e-a3fd-fdf93b790003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-34b6-d9b9-a7fd-feb6aee00003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-a483-db79-af7e-f78321580003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-ca93-deb6-a3fd-eb9fcd7d0026&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-ca93-deb6-a3fd-eb9fccad0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>“But educators, for the most part, we show up no matter the risks,” Tang said. “Our schools used to be considered safe places for students, and institutions where you could go and not have to worry about so many other things that you worry about in the larger community. And that is no longer the case. ... We have to wonder, why is TikTok such an influential platform right now? What does that say about the state of our social-emotional needs of our students?”<br/>  <br/>Mikell Taylor has two young children in the Acton-Boxborough Regional School District: a son in preschool and a daughter in first grade. <br/> <br/>She said it was “quite jarring” to hear about the TikTok threat, but she and her husband decided to send their kids to school. <br/> <br/>“There&#39;s no credible local threat that anybody can point to,” Taylor said. ”If we shut down every time somebody is saying horrible things on social media, we would never do anything. But at the same time, we know that parental instinct of, ‘Oh my god, but what if?’” <br/><br/>Taylor said she and many younger parents need help on how to talk to their children about threats of violence at school.<br/> <br/>“I&#39;m also just sort of dreading the first active shooter drill my daughter goes through,” said Taylor, “because after the first time she had a fire drill this year, you know, she was afraid of fires in our house for like two weeks after it and had trouble sleeping.”<br/> <br/>Both Tang and Merrie Najimy, president of the Massachusetts Teachers Association, emphasized the need for guidance and support staff to help address the needs of students, educators and parents, not just around the spectre of school violence, but the ongoing and sometimes debilitating stress of the pandemic.<br/> <br/>“At minimum, every single building needs a team of social workers, school psychologists, mental health experts, smaller class sizes so we can build relationships and more educational support professionals to help build those relationships,” Najimy said. “We&#39;re talking about building a community of connectedness so that kids don&#39;t feel they have to turn to dangerous and destructive behavior.”<br/> <br/>Boston Public Schools this year added 78 family liaisons and 84 social workers to ensure that they are present in every school.<br/> <br/>Natick Public Schools Superintendent Anna Nolin told GBH News that they beefed up their behavioral support staff prior to the pandemic. And she said they have an ongoing program to help students and parents understand concerns and problems around social media.<br/> <br/>Nolin said she was on the phone late into the night on Thursday with parents, and made a point on Friday of visiting every school in her district with roughly 5,500 students. She said the effort paid off with a day that looked like “business as usual.”<br/> <br/>“We had a lot of good conversations up front with our parents and we proactively communicated,” Nolin said. “I think that gives parents some ease.

Article,St. Vincent Hospital nurses hope their union victory sets a workplace standard for essential workers,St. Vincent Hospital nurses hope their union victory sets a workplace standard for essential workers,"After a nine-month strike, dozens of negotiating sessions and a day-long deliberation, nurses at Worcester’s St. Vincent Hospital and the hospital&#39;s parent company, Dallas-based Tenet Healthcare, reached a tentative agreement on Friday — a peace treaty that nurses hope will set a higher bar for the treatment of essential workers across the country. <br/><br/>“The nursing field has been through so much in the last couple of years,” nurse Dominique Muldoon told GBH News. “We went from being healthcare heroes, and then we struggled and started getting sick ourselves, and some of us even died during the pandemic. I would hope that some things, some attitudes change because of this strike.” <br/><br/>Some 700 nurses participated in the strike as they negotiated for a new contract to <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2021/11/09/there-actually-is-no-shame-in-this-corporation-says-st-vincents-nurse-on-strike"">address staffing concerns</a>, including lowering the number of patients assigned to nurses. One key aspect of the agreement will increase the number of nurses at the hospital. Though the contract has not yet been ratified, both parties are touting it as a win for staff and patients as COVID-19 rates once again rise in the region.<br/><br/>Union leadership with the Massachusetts Nurses Association said the two parties were prepared to settle in August, until Tenet Healthcare refused to allow a proposal that would let striking nurses return to their previous jobs. The most recent agreement concedes that sticking point. As part of the deal, all nurses who went out on strike are guaranteed the right to return to work in the same position, hours and shifts that they worked prior to the strike. <br/><br/>“We got the core issue, and we&#39;re very happy about it,” Muldoon said. “We’re looking forward to getting back to work and having some normalcy in our lives, getting back to nursing and taking care of our patients again.” <br/><br/>In addition, all permanent replacement nurses will be retained in their current positions, according to a hospital spokesperson.<br/><br/>“The decision to allow striking nurses to return to their original positions followed careful consideration of the clinical challenges expected this winter throughout Massachusetts, and the resultant need for as many nurses as possible to provide quality care for our community,” hospital spokesperson Matthew Clyburn said in a statement. <br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1639948932805,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1639948932805,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;Related Stories:&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-05de-de43-ad7f-addf33210003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-ecf7-d2d2-a1fe-feff14a30003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-d492-d91e-a3fd-d4db1f800029&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-d492-d91e-a3fd-d4db1cf30000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>“The new contract will provide enhancements for patients and our team, and we are glad to finally end the strike and put our sole focus back on patient care,” Saint Vincent Chief Executive Officer Carolyn Jackson said in a statement. “We will be setting a new tone at Saint Vincent Hospital: We are one team with a common purpose. Not striking nurses versus replacement nurses. Not nurses versus management. One team united behind the principles of professionalism, excellence, accountability, and compassion.<br/><br/>The St. Vincent nurses <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2021/03/08/nurses-at-worcester-hospital-walk-off-the-job"">walked off the job on March 8</a>, making this the longest nurses strike in state history and the longest in the country in 15 years, according to the Massachusetts Nurses Association. The previous longest strike in the state, at Burbank Hospital in Fitchburg, lasted about six months in 1982.<br/><br/>Marlena Pellegrino, a nurse at St. Vincent Hospital and co-chair of the St. Vincent Hospital nurses’ local bargaining unit, said striking was their last resort. Prior to this action, the nurses had held presentations, sent emails to management, and participated in negotiation meetings.<br/><br/>“This agreement, and the improvements it includes was hard fought, and represents a true victory, not only for the nurses, but more importantly, for our patients and our community, who will have access to better nursing care, which was why our members walked that strike line for the last nine months through four seasons,&quot; Pellegrino said in a statement.<br/><br/>Specific details of the agreement are being withheld until a ratification vote is conducted. Union organizers said nurses are eager to complete that step as soon as possible, though a specific timeline has not been provided. <br/><br/>“I have nothing but pride and appreciation for all 700 nurses [who] literally put everything on the line for their patients and this community,” Marie Ritacco, St. Vincent nurse and MNA vice president told GBH News in a statement Sunday. “Our strike struck a chord, and for that and because of that we will walk into that building with our heads held high.”<br/><br/>Muldoon says meetings to share contract information continue, including one this Wednesday — though she anticipates the ratification process may take longer than a few days. Sessions have been going well, Muldoon says, and represent a standard for essential workers that she hopes extends to other groups of people working during the pandemic. <br/><br/>“There&#39;s a lot of essential workers out there, I&#39;m not saying that nurses are the only ones, but we happened to stand up and I think we shined a light on it,” Muldoon told GBH in an interview Sunday. “I would hope other professions would feel the same way.”<br/><br/>The St. Vincent nurses walked off the job on March 8, making this the longest nurses strike in state history and the longest in the country in 15 years, according to the Massachusetts Nurses Association.

That’s significantly more than the 11 found in 2020, when the pandemic kept many travelers at home. The agency said the last time it found 18 firearms at Logan Airport was in 2019, and it wants the public to be vigilant about following the rules to safely travel with guns.<br/><br/>“Passengers are allowed to travel with their firearms and ammunition as long as they follow the proper procedures,” said Bob Allison, TSA’s federal security director for Massachusetts and Maine, in a statement. “Travelers should never bring a gun — loaded or unloaded — to a security checkpoint, because they are not permitted to be carried into the cabin of a plane. Carelessly traveling with a firearm is a public safety concern, considering it could accidentally be discharged during a search.” <br/><br/>Where local firearm possession laws permit — including Massachusetts — passengers in the United States can travel with firearms in checked baggage if it’s in a locked, hard-sided case. A passenger cannot bring a gun aboard a plane, regardless of if they have a concealed weapon permit.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1640129724685,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1640129724685,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-d80a-dc47-a77f-fbafc7160003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-4d05-d82a-af7c-efddd3d40003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-4d5c-d0ab-a17d-4fff29360003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-df58-dc47-a77f-fffd8f480012&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-df58-dc47-a77f-fffd8e570000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>If passengers travel with ammunition, it has to be in its original box and can be packed inside the hard-side case next to the firearm. The case has to be presented at the airline check-in counter. Airline representatives must informed of a passenger&#39;s intention to travel with a firearm, along with a form declaring that. The case is assessed in a checked baggage scanner, and goes into the cargo hold of a plane. <br/><br/>Michael Portelli, the supervisory transportation inspector for Logan Airport’s TSA, said gun-owning travelers can make several mistakes when preparing a gun for travel.<br/><br/>“First, that it&#39;s not locked. Second would be that it&#39;s in the soft-sided container, that would be like, in a canvas bag — which would not be acceptable. The last thing would be with that they would not declare it to the airline. The airline needs to know its flying,” he said. On top of the TSA&#39;s rules, many airlines also have their own requirements for passengers traveling with firearms.<br/><br/>The majority of firearms detected by the airport’s computed tomography scanners this year were handguns: 9 millimeter, .38- and .32-caliber. All were loaded, according to local TSA spokesman Dan Velez. Most people claimed they didn’t know they were carrying a gun, or that it belonged to their spouse and that spouse had packed it without their knowledge.<br/><br/>Consequences for attempting to improperly travel with a gun can include fines for the passenger and airline. <br/><br/>If someone is found with a firearm at a security checkpoint, the Massachusetts State Police are called. <br/><br/>The TSA can issue a federal financial civil penalty to travelers who have guns or gun parts with them at a checkpoint, typically $4,100 for a first offense though it can go as high as $13,669. The TSA’s federal security director for Massachusetts can nominate someone for the FBI’s no-fly list if they have multiple offenses for bringing a gun for the airport, but that’s rare. <br/><br/>Velez said if individuals declare a firearm at the check-in counter but TSA security agents find it was not packed properly, the agency can fine airlines for not making sure the item was properly packaged. <br/><br/>The most recent gun was found on Dec. 8, when TSA officers detected the loaded 9 mm firearm along with a magazine containing 10 rounds at Terminal B. They immediately notified the state police, who confiscated the firearm. The Massachusetts resident said he hadn’t used the bag in over a year and wasn’t aware the firearm was in there. He was issued a summons to appear in court and cleared to fly.<br/><br/>Nationwide, TSA officers have stopped more than 5,700 firearms at security checkpoints in 2021, a 20-year record.<br/><br/>The agency said that overall in New England airports, gun detections tend to be lower than other parts of the country because the regional gun laws are stricter.<br/><br/>“Any time you get a surge of travelers like we&#39;re going to see here in the next 10 days, we tend to be on really high alert because you have so many people coming through,” said Velez. “There&#39;s a higher chance that somebody is going to try to come through the security checkpoint with a firearm.” <br/>",Sarah Betancourt,Tue Dec 21 20:06:02 EST 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She said she used to be able to buy beef for $4.29 per pound. Then it went up to $5. Then $6. Now she pays $7.29.<br/><br/>&quot;I’m trying to hold fast to maintain a price point, but it becomes difficult to do so and run a profitable margin,” Straughter said. “For a business like mine, how are you going to survive this winter?”<br/><br/>Small businesses across the country are struggling as they face myriad challenges posed by the supply chain crisis, increased consumer demand and labor shortages — all without the large-scale vendors and other support structures that major corporations can rely upon.<br/><br/>According to a <a href=""https://portal.census.gov/pulse/data/#data"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>US Census poll</u></a> of small businesses taken in late November, 66.5% of businesses said they were experiencing delays from domestic or foreign suppliers. In early April, that number was only 41.3%. This translates to an overwhelming majority — 74.8% — of small businesses reporting a large or moderate increase in the prices they pay for goods and services since the pandemic began in March 2020.<br/><br/>This is no “typical” pandemic-related supply chain crunch, and Nubian Square’s local businesses are no exception to the grim rule.<br/><br/>At Soleil, Straughter faces an impossible choice: raise her prices and risk losing customers or concede defeat and run at a loss. <br/><br/>In the same building, Dudley Café general manager Jebin Tuladhar said their supply shortages have created price hikes the likes of which he has never seen in his tenure as manager.<br/><br/>“The price of a product goes up every day,” he said. “We can’t just keep increasing the price of the menu because that’s typically not how the business is run.”<br/><br/>Rising paper prices have hit the café particularly hard. Because food needs to be packaged individually for safety reasons during the pandemic, the restaurant’s expenses for paper and plastic are beginning to outpace what they pay to make their food.<br/><br/>Tuladhar said that the restaurant is an anchor for Nubian Square and a celebration of local culture. The coffee shop boasts a rich multicultural menu that honors women of color with dishes named after Frida Kahlo, Michelle Obama and Boston’s own Ayanna Pressley. <br/><br/>“We have a lot of artists that come into the café, we have a lot of City Hall people come around,” Tuladhar said. “We also do art exhibitions for neighborhood artists … and we put their art often in the café.”<br/><br/>He believes his customers represent a slice of Roxbury’s community and culture.

Instead, he said he will resign from his post at the ACLU effective at the end of this month in order to launch an exploratory committee. He told GBH News he was inspired to consider a run after his work on the voter engagement &quot;What a Difference a DA Makes&quot; program.<br/><br/>The program, he said, exposed him to &quot;the lack of awareness of how much power and influence district attorneys have on people&#39;s day-to-day lives.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I felt that it would be worth looking into whether or not someone who holds my views on the criminal legal system and has a commitment to racial justice could have a meaningful impact here in Plymouth County,&quot; he said.<br/><br/>If Hall pursues a run, his candidacy could spell out a potential challenge to longtime Plymouth County District Attorney Timothy J. Cruz.<br/><br/>Cruz, a 20-year incumbent, was first appointed to the office in 2001 by then acting Gov.

Under the Biden administration, the department abandoned the appeal, paving the way for Wednesday’s decision.<br/><br/>The Cape Cod-based tribe was granted more than 300 acres of land in trust in 2015 by then-President Barack Obama, a move that carved out the federally protected land needed for the tribe to develop its planned $1 billion First Light casino, hotel and entertainment resort.<br/><br/>The tribe learned last year that the federal government was moving to reverse the reservation designation.<br/><br/>The Trump administration had decided it could not take the land into trust because the tribe was not officially recognized as of June 1, 1934. That was the year the federal Indian Reorganization Act, which laid the foundation for modern federal Indian policy, became law.<br/><br/>The tribe, which traces its ancestry to the Native Americans that shared a fall harvest meal with the Pilgrims in 1621, gained federal recognition in 2007.<br/><br/>Weeden thanked President Biden and other elected officials, including U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey and U.S. Rep. William Keating — all Massachusetts Democrats — for their support.<br/><br/>“Today’s decision allows us to reclaim and protect our cherished Land and better serve the Mashpee Tribe for generations to come,” Weeden wrote. “While the injustices inflicted upon us cannot be erased, we can look to the future — a future of freedom, a future of prosperity, and a future of peace. We wish this not just for the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, but for Tribal communities all across the land.”<br/>",Associated Press,Thu Dec 23 16:25:14 EST 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Board of Health in October denied the Deeleys a new permit that would have allowed them to keep the roosters.<br/><br/>The Deeleys in the suit said the power of a local health board is limited when it comes to commercial farms and the “crowing of roosters” does not constitute a nuisance under state law.<br/><br/>The suit seeks damages and a reversal of the board&#39;s decision.<br/><br/>The city in response said it has the authority to revoke the animal permit for cause and asked that the suit be dismissed.<br/>",The Salem (Mass.)

Article,Desmond Tutu's legacy lives on in Boston,Desmond Tutu's legacy lives on in Boston,"In 1999, guests arriving at the wedding of Stewart Ting Chong and Marsha Minasian at St. John’s Episcopal Church in Hingham were surprised to find none other than Archbishop Desmond Tutu officiating. <br/> <br/>But the groom and the Nobel Peace Prize winning nonviolent activist had a shared history. Ting Chong, who is Asian, grew up in apartheid South Africa, where he was classified as “non-white,” living in a restricted area and unable to attend white-only schools. Ting Chong was accepted into the priesthood in 1987, where he and Tutu crossed paths. Ting Chong worked closely with Tutu for many years as part of the archbishop’s media team in their fight against South African apartheid. When Ting Chong moved to the US in 1999 to marry his fiancé from Rockland, Massachusetts, Tutu agreed to officiate.<br/> <br/>Tutu, who died Sunday of cancer in Cape Town at age 90, visited the Boston area many times throughout his life for various reasons other than that wedding. He gave speeches and held small group discussions — sometimes impromptu events to shocked groups of students, activists or admirers. Following his death, local leaders reflected on Tutu’s legacy as a spiritual leader who helped end apartheid in South Africa and lead reconciliation efforts throughout the 1990s.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1640611310874,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-62e6-dde0-ad63-fbf6275a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1640611310874,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-62e6-dde0-ad63-fbf6275a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-f6d3-d982-a77d-ffd3a5240000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000163-08ee-dcf0-abf7-38ffbd6e0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-377f-d887-adfb-77ffe6b90000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-f97d-d982-a77d-f97f9b7c0029&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-f97d-d982-a77d-f97f990b0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/><b>“He taught me what true courage is”</b><br/><br/>Ting Chong worked with Tutu at a time when it was particularly dangerous to be an anti-apartheid activist in South Africa. <br/> <br/>“He taught me what true courage is,” Ting Chong said. “Courage to defend the downtrodden and to speak against injustice and racism. To be able to witness that, to be able to see one man stand in front of thousands of people and say, ‘Stop,’ and they would stop.” <br/> <br/>Working in media for Tutu, Ting Chong recalled how the apartheid government restricted access to international press. “His office and a small media team, which included myself, were the only people that were truly getting information out,” Ting Chong said.<br/><br/>Ting Chong recalled that the work was so risky, he stopped visiting his own brother at the time, who also lived in Cape Town. “I said, ‘It&#39;s just too dangerous, just by association, I can&#39;t involve you,” Ting Chong recalled telling his brother. “We have our phones tapped … first thing in the morning before we drive, we look under our cars. Before we go to bed we look outside to see if there&#39;s any vehicles that we don&#39;t recognize in the streets.”<br/> <br/>One time at the airport — where Ting Chong recalled Tutu and his family were regularly searched — he saw a person inching toward Tutu. <br/><br/>“I immediately, without even thinking, moved myself between the Archbishop and this person,” Ting Chong said. Nothing happened, but he did not regret his decision. “That’s the kind of thought that goes through one&#39;s mind when there&#39;s a person that you’re working for that is so large and so influential.”<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1640610362639,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-62e6-dde0-ad63-fbf6275a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1640610362639,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-62e6-dde0-ad63-fbf6275a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;quote&quot;:&quot;&amp;quot;His sermon was around two cultures coming together and becoming one and therefore taking the richness of different cultures in order to welcome others.”&quot;,&quot;attribution&quot;:&quot;Stewart Ting Chong, friend of Archbishop Desmond Tutu &quot;,&quot;fallbackToPerson&quot;:false,&quot;useGrayBackground&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-fbfe-deb6-a3fd-fbff0fdc0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000162-022d-dc51-ab7b-96bf02e20008&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-fbfe-deb6-a3fd-fbff0fae0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>When apartheid fell and former South African President Nelson Mandela appointed Tutu as chair of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Ting Chong resigned as new leadership took Tutu’s place.

While that might feel or seem incongruous with a human rights activist who&#39;s literally experienced and witnessed the worst of humanity, somehow, in him, it was no contradiction.”<br/> <br/>Despite the controversy surrounding the topic, the sanctuary was packed. “While the subject is contested and difficult, I fully believed that he had earned his right to say his piece and speak his mind,” Taylor said. “He was a voice and a force … as a young minister, he was somebody that I was in awe of, in terms of his ministry, his courage, his incisive thinking, mostly his deep, deep spirituality.”<br/> <br/>Tutu made many other visits to Boston. In 2008, he spoke at a private event with Harvard Nieman fellows, as well as at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center at the Greenbuild International Conference and Expo, where he talked about the role of social justice in environmental equity.<br/><br/><b>&quot;A man of faith using that faith to be a change agent&quot;</b><br/> <br/>Former Boston City Councilor Tito Jackson met Tutu multiple times, most recently in South Africa in 2017. Jackson recalled taking part in dialogue sessions with the Archbishop multiple times in Boston, through their shared work with a racial justice organization called Global Citizens Circle. <br/> <br/>“These events were called circles, and the interesting part was, it was people having courageous conversations,” Jackson said. “He had attended as a discussion group leader multiple times, and each time was one of those mountaintop experiences, when you get to listen, hear and most importantly feel his presence, his knowledge and his guidance in the room.”<br/> <br/>Reflecting on his experiences with the Archbishop, Jackson emphasized the impact Tutu had across the world. <br/> <br/>“The legacy of Archbishop Desmond Tutu speaks to the embodiment of a man of faith using that faith to be a change agent,” he said. “Being unwilling to be silent in the most difficult of times, and also using the opportunity and privilege that he had to not stay neutral in situations of injustice.&quot;",Rebecca Tauber,Mon Dec 27 08:24:50 EST 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,A long journey from Kabul brings one family to New Bedford,A long journey from Kabul brings one family to New Bedford,"This summer, the U.S. ended its 20-year war in Afghanistan. As the Taliban captured the capital, Kabul, tens of thousands of Afghans fled the country, fearing repression and economic collapse. <br/><br/>Farkhanda Ehssan&#39;s family is one of several whose journey out of Kabul led them to New Bedford, Massachusetts. <br/><br/>On a recent evening, Ehssan checked on the beans in her small second-story apartment as her three kids waited eagerly for dinner. The older kids pecked at a video game on their mom’s phone, while the youngest, 4, clambered onto the table for an impromptu dance performance.<br/><br/>Ehssan is grateful for light-hearted scenes like this, since such moments have been hard to come by. In recent months, her family spent most nights sleeping in tents on military bases — in Qatar, Germany, and El Paso, Texas. They finally arrived at this apartment a couple weeks ago.<br/><br/>The family’s long journey from Kabul to New Bedford began on the morning of August 15 — but Ehssan said she didn’t realize it at first. “When we woke up, everything was normal,&quot; she said, recalling that day. &quot;My husband left for his job, and the kids left for school.”<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1640707830744,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1640707830744,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-e2aa-d7e8-a1ff-eefbe7240003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017b-f47c-d9cf-a9ff-f6fc9b040000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017b-ad35-d0ff-a1fb-edf5a7330000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-01cc-dc47-a77f-bbed702f0008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-01cc-dc47-a77f-bbed6f190000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>Ehssan worked for the U.S. government’s Agency for International Development, helping train Afghan women to be journalists. Around 10 a.m. that day, Ehssan got a call from her sister-in-law.<br/><br/>“She told me, ‘The Taliban has come.’ I said, ‘What are you saying?

She said her neighbors all across Kabul were feeling the same anxiety.<br/><br/>“The people were very much afraid of the Taliban,” said Ehssan. “Everyone was hopeless that they have conquered the whole country. Now what? What will happen with our schools, with our education, with our economy, with our culture? We don’t know the answers.”<br/><br/>Ten days later, the U.S. military offered her family a flight out of Kabul, thanks to her work with the U.S. government. The family waited in the airport for three days, with no food, until their flight finally departed. During the wait, a <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2021/08/26/1031244804/kabul-airport-explosion-afghanistan"" class=""Link"" target=""_blank"" style=""background-repeat: no-repeat; box-sizing: border-box; background-color: transparent; touch-action: manipulation; color: var(--linkColor); text-decoration: none;"">suicide bombing</a> killed dozens of people trying to enter the airport.<br/><br/>Kabul’s banks closed when the Taliban arrived. So despite her well-paying job, Ehssan took off with no money — just six gold bracelets around her wrist.<br/><br/>Last month, her family was at a camp in El Paso. Ehssan was teaching an English class to other refugees one day when she got a text informing her of where her family would be resettled long-term. The place name was unfamiliar: Massachusetts.<br/><br/>That’s when the Googling began.<br/><br/>“The first thing I search was the map — where is Massachusetts situated?” she said. Ehssan was glad to find it on the same side of the country as Virginia, where she has a sister.<br/><br/>Ehssan’s family spent their final days in El Paso glued to the internet, reading up on their future home state. “It has a good economy,&quot; she said, recalling those days and what she learned online. &quot;The best schools are here. And the housing is very expensive.”<br/><br/>Arriving in New Bedford has meant at least a touch of normalcy. Ehssan could finally cook her own food for the family, after months of eating military-grade boiled eggs for breakfast.<br/><br/>The first morning in their new apartment, Ehssan’s kids requested, “&#39;Mom, cook us eggs in our own style,’&quot; she recalls with a smile.<br/><br/>So Ehssan fried the eggs, leaving the yolks runny. “They were very, very happy for that.”<br/><br/>Ehssan’s husband has started a job at a warehouse. Ehssan is looking for work too. In the meantime, she’s helping her family settle into New Bedford with trips to the playground and a visit to the local mosque. They’ve also taken in some of the city’s signature waterfront sights.<br/><br/>“We have seen the fishing boats,” said Ehssan, adding that her kids have begged for a ride on one.<br/><br/>The family is one of five who have settled in New Bedford after fleeing Afghanistan this summer. More are waiting to come, but it’s been hard to find housing.<br/><br/>Local aid groups are working to secure housing and accepting donations to support the families.<i> </i>The <a href=""https://immigrantsassistancecenter.org/"" class=""Link"" target=""_blank"" style=""background-repeat: no-repeat; box-sizing: border-box; background-color: transparent; touch-action: manipulation; color: var(--linkColor); text-decoration: none;"">Immigrants Assistance Center</a> in New Bedford is collecting gift cards to restaurants and supermarkets.

For now, though, she’s taking things one step at a time. She’s getting her kids registered for school, while also keeping them connected to their homeland through their first language, Dari (which she also calls Persian).<br/><br/>“To be honest, I told them, ‘You’ll learn English at school, but [when] you’re at home, you try to speak Persian so you don’t forget your own language,’” said Ehssan. “Because it will help them again. I hope we can have a time to move back to our country, be in our country, see our country. So they should not forget their own language.”",Daniel Ackerman,Tue Dec 28 11:16:48 EST 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To lessen strain on the court system and decrease risk of viral transmission in its buildings, spokeswoman Jennifer Donahue said the system will prioritize cases involving a defendant in custody and limit the number of jurors asked to serve on jury pools.<br/><br/>“All Courts are increasing COVID-19 mitigation protocols including additional health assessments of court users, increased social distancing, and the continued use of masks by all court users,” she said in an emailed statement. The trial court system also includes the Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court. <br/><br/>Donahue said the court system is not requiring proof of vaccination, but is asking people to check the <a href=""https://www.mass.gov/info-details/what-to-know-before-going-to-a-courthouse-during-covid-19"" target=""_blank"">website</a> of each court they’re planning to visit and follow the outlined procedures.

District Court business will be handled by the Taunton District Court through the end of the week.<br/><br/>Pittsfield District Court is also closed due to court staff testing positive, and will continue to operate remotely until Jan. 3. <br/><br/>The state’s Committee for Public Counsel Services has been communicating with the Trial Court over the past two weeks, and will soon request changes in response to the omicron variant and the increase of cases, according to Robert McGovern, communications director for the group. <br/><br/>&quot;We will be suggesting steps that we believe the court could take to better protect clients and attorneys and the public who come to the court each day,” he said. <br/><br/>The silver lining to some is that the trial system’s move to prioritize cases where people are already incarcerated could expedite their potential freedom. Elizabeth Matos, director of Prisoners Legal Services, said prisoners should be sent home to wait for their day in court, but if that’s not going to happen, this is a good step for prisoners to stay safe from COVID-19.<br/><br/>“We don&#39;t want people lingering in jail for prolonged periods of time without trials happening, when people who are pretrial are supposed to be getting a speedy trial,” she said. Remaining incarcerated increases their risk of exposure, she added. <br/><br/>Matos said there are concerns about mounting COVID-19 cases at county jails, including in Bristol, Hampshire and Essex counties. Vaccination rates among correctional officers and prisoners are lower than state prisons, she said. County guards don’t fall under Gov. Charlie Baker’s vaccine mandate for state prison employees.

And what we did not play is a U.S. military compromised – not to the degree that the United States is compromised today, as far as 39% of the Republican Party refusing to accept President Biden as president – but a compromise nonetheless. So, we advocate that that particular scenario needs to be addressed in a future war game held well in advance of 2024.<br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1640961735561,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000168-2a01-dff6-a1ef-fabd12060000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1640961735561,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000168-2a01-dff6-a1ef-fabd12060000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-10ee-d4b5-a5ff-dbee11bc0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-10f0-d6e5-af7f-15fae7de0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-10f0-d6e5-af7f-15fae7cb0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">Protestors push an American flag into a doorway of the Capitol.</bsp-image><h3 class=""edTag"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 35px 0px 10px; padding: 0px 15px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: 600; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 2.2rem; line-height: 1.4em; font-family: &quot;Gotham SSm&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; max-width: 680px; position: relative; float: none; width: auto; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;"">Can the current Pentagon leadership handle it?</h3>I&#39;m a huge fan of Secretary [of Defense Lloyd] Austin, a huge fan of the team that he has put together and the uniformed military under General Milley.

Article,"Betty White, TV’s Golden Girl, dies at 99","Betty White, TV’s Golden Girl, dies at 99","LOS ANGELES (AP) — Betty White, whose saucy, up-for-anything charm made her a television mainstay for more than 60 years, whether as a man-crazy TV hostess on “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” or the loopy housemate on “The Golden Girls,” has died. She was 99.<br/><br/>People and the Washington Post reported Friday the news of White’s death.<br/><br/>She launched her TV career in daytime talk shows when the medium was still in its infancy and endured well into the age of cable and streaming. Her combination of sweetness and edginess gave life to a roster of quirky characters in shows from the sitcom “Life With Elizabeth” in the early 1950s to oddball Rose Nylund in “The Golden Girls” in the ’80s to “Boston Legal,” which ran from 2004 to 2008.<br/><br/>But it was in 2010 that White’s stardom erupted as never before.<br/><br/>In a Snickers commercial that premiered during that year’s Super Bowl telecast, she impersonated an energy-sapped dude getting tackled during a backlot football game.<br/><br/>“Mike, you’re playing like Betty White out there,” jeered one of his chums. White, flat on the ground and covered in mud, fired back, “That’s not what your girlfriend said!”<br/><br/>The instantly-viral video helped spark a Facebook campaign called “Betty White to Host SNL (please?)!,” whose half-million fans led to her co-hosting “Saturday Night Live” in a much-watched, watch-hailed edition that Mother’s Day weekend. The appearance won her a seventh Emmy award.<br/><br/>A month later, cable’s TV Land premiered “Hot In Cleveland,” the network’s first original scripted series, which starred Valerie Bertinelli, Jane Leeves and Wendie Malick as three past-their-prime show-biz veterans who move to Cleveland to escape the youth obsession of Hollywood. They move into a home being looked after by an elderly Polish widow — a character, played by White, who was meant to appear only in the pilot episode.<br/><br/>But White stole the show, and the salty Elka Ostrovsky became a key part of the series, an immediate hit. She was voted the Entertainer of the Year by members of The Associated Press.<br/><br/>“It’s ridiculous,” White said of the honor. “They haven’t caught on to me, and I hope they never do.”<br/><br/>By then, White had not only become the hippest star around, but also a role model for how to grow old joyously.<br/><br/>“Don’t try to be young,” she told The AP. “Just open your mind. Stay interested in stuff. There are so many things I won’t live long enough to find out about, but I’m still curious about them.”<br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1640981622584,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000168-2a01-dff6-a1ef-fabd12060000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1640981622584,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000168-2a01-dff6-a1ef-fabd12060000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-121f-d4b5-a5ff-dbbfca480000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-1220-d6e5-af7f-177a5c030000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-1220-d6e5-af7f-177a5bf00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">1000-1.jpg</bsp-image><br/>Such was her popularity that even White’s birthday became a national event: In January 2012, NBC aired “Betty White’s 90th Birthday Party” as a star-studded prime-time special. She would later appear in such series as “Bones” and Fireside Chat With Esther” and in 2019 gave voice to one of the toys, “Bitey White,” in “Toy Story 4.”<br/><br/>White remained youthful in part through her skill at playing bawdy or naughty while radiating niceness. The horror spoof “Lake Placid” and the comedy “The Proposal” were marked by her characters’ surprisingly salty language. And her character Catherine Piper killed a man with a skillet on “Boston Legal.”<br/><br/>But she almost wasn’t cast as “Happy Homemaker” Sue Ann Nivens in “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” in 1973. She and her husband, Allen Ludden, were close friends of Moore and Moore’s then-husband, producer Grant Tinker. It was feared that if White failed on the show, which already was a huge hit, it would be embarrassing for all four. But CBS casting head Ethel Winant declared White the logical choice. Originally planned as a one-shot appearance, the role of Sue Ann (which humorously foreshadowed Martha Stewart) lasted until Moore ended the series in 1977.<br/><br/>“While she’s icky-sweet on her cooking show, Sue is really a piranha type,” White once said. The role brought her two Emmys as supporting actress in a comedy series.<br/><br/>In 1985, White starred on NBC with Bea Arthur, Rue McClanahan and Estelle Getty in “The Golden Girls.” Its cast of mature actresses, playing single women in Miami retirement, presented a gamble in a youth-conscious industry. But it proved a solid hit and lasted until 1992.<br/><br/>White played Rose, a gentle, dim widow who managed to misinterpret most situations. She drove her roommates crazy with off-the-wall tales of childhood in fictional St. Olaf, Minnesota, an off-kilter version of Lake Wobegon.<br/><br/>The role won her another Emmy, and she reprised it in a short-lived spinoff, “The Golden Palace.”<br/><br/>After her co-star Arthur died in 2009, White told Entertainment Tonight: “She showed me how to be very brave in playing comedy. I’ll miss that courage.”<br/><br/>White’s other TV series included “Mama’s Family,” as Vicki Lawrence’s irascible mother; “Just Men,” a game show in which women tried to predict answers to questions directed to male celebrities; and “Ladies Man,” as the catty mother of Alfred Molina.<br/><br/>“Just Men” brought her a daytime Emmy, while she won a fourth prime time Emmy in 1996 for a guest shot on “The John Larroquette Show.”<br/><br/>She also appeared in numerous miniseries and TV movies and made her film debut as a female U.S. senator in Otto Preminger’s 1962 Capitol Hill drama “Advise and Consent.”<br/><br/>White began her television career as $50-a-week sidekick to a local Los Angeles TV personality in 1949. She was hired for a local daytime show starring Al Jarvis, the best-known disc jockey in Los Angeles.<br/><br/>It was then she got a tip to start lying about her age.<br/><br/>“We are so age-conscious in this country,” she said in a 2011 interview with The Associated Press. “It’s silly, but that’s the way we are. So I was told, ‘Knock four years off right now. You’ll be blessing yourself down the road.’<br/><br/>“I was born in 1922. So I thought, ‘I must always remember that I was born in 1926.’ But then I would have to do the math. Finally, I decided to heck with it.”<br/><br/>White proved to be a natural for the new medium. She was bright, pretty and likable, with a dimpled, eye-crinkling smile. A 1951 Los Angeles Times headline said: “Betty White Hailed as TV’s Busiest Gal.”<br/><br/>“I did that show 5½ hours a day, six days a week, for 4½ years,” she recalled in 1975. Jarvis was replaced by actor Eddie Albert, and when he went to Europe for the film “Roman Holiday,” she headed the show.<br/><br/>A sketch she had done with Jarvis turned into a syndicated series, “Life With Elizabeth,” which won her first Emmy. For a time she did interviews on “The Betty White Show” in the daytime, filmed the series at night and often turned up on a late-night talk show. She also appeared on commercials and every New Year’s narrated the Pasadena Rose Parade.<br/><br/>With the glib tongue and quick responses nurtured in the Jarvis years, she was a welcome guest on “I’ve Got a Secret,” “To Tell the Truth,” “What’s My Line” and other game shows — all the way up to the 2008 “Million Dollar Password,” which revived the game once hosted by Ludden, whom she had met when a contestant on his original “Password.”<br/><br/>That was in 1961, and the next year, while touring in summer theater during television’s off season, she starred with Ludden — by then a widower with three children — in the comedy “Critic’s Choice.”<br/><br/>White, who had claimed to be “militantly single” since a 1947-1949 marriage, weakened in her resolve.<br/><br/>“I had always said on `The Tonight Show’ and everywhere else that I would never get married again,” she told a reporter in 1963. “But Allen outnumbered me. He started in and even the children got in the act. And I surrendered — willingly.”<br/><br/>The marriage lasted from 1963 until his death from cancer in 1981.<br/><br/>Off-screen, White tirelessly raised money for animal causes such as the Morris Animal Foundation and the Los Angeles Zoo. In 1970-1971, she wrote, produced and hosted a syndicated TV show, “The Pet Set,” to which celebrities brought their dogs and cats. She wrote a 1983 book titled “Betty White’s Pet Love: How Pets Take Care of Us,” and, in 2011, published “Betty &amp; Friends: My Life at the Zoo.”<br/><br/>Her devotion to pets was such that she declined a plum role in the hit 1997 movie “As Good As It Gets.” She objected to a scene in which Jack Nicholson drops a small dog down a laundry chute.<br/><br/>In her 2011 book “If You Ask Me (And Of Course You Won’t),” White explained the origins of her love for dogs. During the Depression, her dad made radios to sell to make extra money. But since few people had money to buy the radios, he willingly traded them for dogs, which, housed in kennels in the backyard, at times numbered as many as 15 and made White’s happy childhood even happier.<br/><br/>Are there any critters she doesn’t like?<br/><br/>“No,” White told the AP. “Anything with a leg on each corner.”<br/><br/>Then what about snakes?<br/><br/>“Ohhh, I LOVE snakes!”<br/><br/>She was born Betty Marion White in Oak Park, Illinois, and the family moved to Los Angeles when she was a toddler.<br/><br/>“I’m an only child, and I had a mother and dad who never drew a straight line: They just thought funny,” she told The Associated Press in 2015. “We’d sit around the breakfast table and then we’d start kicking it around. My dad was a salesman and he would come home with jokes. He’d say, `Sweetheart, you can take THAT one to school. But I wouldn’t take THIS one.′ We had such a wonderful time.”<br/><br/>Her early ambition was to be a writer, and she wrote her grammar school graduation play, giving herself the leading role.<br/><br/>At Beverly Hills High School, her ambition turned to acting, and she appeared in several school plays. Her parents hoped she’d go to college, but instead she took roles in a small theater and played bit parts in radio dramas.<br/><br/>Explaining in 2011 how she kept up her frantic pace even as an octogenarian, she explained that she only needed four hours of sleep each night.<br/><br/>And when asked how she had managed to be universally beloved during her decades-spanning career, she summed up with a dimpled smile: “I just make it my business to get along with people so I can have fun.

On Monday, Chau was elected as the first Cambodian American mayor in the United States, taking the oath of office in the Lowell Memorial Auditorium. <br/><br/>Lowell City Councilor Chau also took his place as the city’s first mayor of color, unanimously elected by his 10 colleagues on the council, a message that he said holds meaning to the city’s largely immigrant population.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1641342698333,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1641342698333,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000179-476c-de59-a579-cf6cf7640003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-ccc4-d7e8-a1ff-ccdd03370003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-01c8-dc47-a77f-bbedc5ae0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-27a0-d6e5-af7f-27fae5e6002d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-27a0-d6e5-af7f-27fae5bb0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>“They sent a message to the rest of the community here, too. You know, you work hard, you try to bring people together to unite everyone and work for a common goal, which is really to enhance the quality of life in the city for everyone,” he told GBH News in a Zoom interview. “We have millions of Cambodian diaspora around the world. We love our country and we try to achieve a level of success and establish roots and history wherever we are, wherever we decide to make a home.”<br/><br/>Chau, 49, and his family suffered immensely to access the American Dream. His father, a captain in the Cambodian Army, was killed by Khmer Rouge in 1975 as the country was embroiled in a years-long civil war. His mother, Hem Hay, kept the children alive through what he described as “hunger and illness” for four years until they found the opportunity to escape, traveling by night and avoiding landmines. In 1981 they arrived in Pennsylvania as refugees sponsored by the Catholic Church, and lived in a convent for a couple of years. <br/><br/>Chau said that’s when he discovered his Christian faith, which he brought with him when the family moved to Lowell’s Acre community in the mid-1980s. The Acre <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/lowe/learn/historyculture/the-acre.htm"">neighborhood</a> has been home to generations of immigrants from Ireland, Eastern Europe, Latin America and Southeast Asia for 170 years. <br/><br/>“When you first come as an immigrant and you didn&#39;t have anything, you probably would end up in this neighborhood called Acre. It&#39;s a great history for the city, and you have it as a starting point for many immigrants,” he said. <br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1641342912980,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1641342912980,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;migration.alignment&quot;:&quot;LEFT&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-27a7-da64-a77e-2ff72b690001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-27a7-d4b5-a5ff-ffa70ef80000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:&quot;/enhancement/EnhancementLeft.hbs&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-27a7-d4b5-a5ff-ffa70ee10000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">photo from sarah.png</bsp-image><br/>While his older siblings went to work, Chau attended the Bartlett School and won a scholarship to attend Phillips Academy in Andover. He studied political science and economics at Macalester College in Minnesota before returning home to Lowell. The position of mayor in Lowell is considered part-time, so Chau will continue to work as an employee at the state’s Social Security Administration.<br/><br/>Lowell has a strong city manager form of government and does not directly elect a mayor, but does expect the mayor to chair the city council and the school committee. <br/><br/>Chau served a two-year term as City Councilor after his 2019 election.<br/><br/>Chau’s immigrant backstory reverberates throughout Lowell, which has the nation’s second-largest Cambodian community outside of Long Beach, Calif. The city’s population is nearly 25% Asian, and Lowell is also home to many Latin American immigrants. <br/><br/>He recognized the significance of his position in his inaugural address. “We cannot change our past or take back the sorrows from where we came,” Chau said. “But together, we can fashion a brighter future. We cannot change the world. But collectively, we can make historic change in Lowell. To the Cambodian diaspora around the world, we can no longer be just victims. It is our time to now to be leaders and to succeed.”<br/><br/>Chau’s biggest competitor in the mayoral race was Councilor <a href=""http://www.vesnaforlowell.com/meet-vesna.html"" target=""_blank"">Vesna Nuon</a>, another Cambodian refugee. Nuon withdrew his bid at the end of December to unify the council, according to the <a href=""https://www.lowellsun.com/2021/12/29/vesna-nuon-withdraws-from-mayoral-contest-with-sokhary-chau/"">Lowell Sun</a>. <br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1641342985860,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1641342985860,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-2792-da64-a77e-2fd76af00001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;Lowell Mayor Sokhary Chau, shown here in a Zoom interview GBH News Tuesday, is the first Cambodian-American mayor of a U.S. city. &quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-2797-d6e5-af7f-27ff4d3e0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-2797-d6e5-af7f-27ff4d2a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">Lowell mayor Sokhary Chau.png</bsp-image><br/>Chau wants to see more diversity in city government and increase access to city services among immigrants. <br/><br/>“It’s important we get immigrant families involved, you know, make them feel comfortable seeking resources and resource from city, whether it&#39;s at City Hall or the school department or what have you. I think it&#39;s important to provide that equal access to everyone,” he said. <br/><br/>For policy issues, Chau says he wants to help alleviate the impacts of COVID-19 on the city’s population by alleviating stress on small businesses and improving health information access, and mentioned decreasing homelessness and finding affordable housing.<br/><br/>”Housing supply is a huge issue,” Chau said, adding that even if a couple has three jobs combined, they can’t afford a good, safe living arrangement. Finding solutions for the working-class population, he said, is a priority. <br/><br/>At the swearing-in, Chau was joined by wife Somong Rattanayong, and his two sons, ages 15 and 17. Chau&#39;s inauguration earned the praise of U.S. Ambassador to Cambodia W.

Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey to call for an immediate review of the facility by the Department of Homeland Security.<br/><br/>In a letter this week to officials at Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement and the DHS, Warren and Markey said they have heard concerns from detainees about inadequate medical care, limited and monitored interactions with counsel, violation of detainees’ rights to practice religion and retaliatory punishment against inmates who filed complaints.

Following the report of sexual harassment and physical assault, one detainee’s lawyers also claim that he was inappropriately denied access to a visa after reporting the crime due to a failure of the facility’s systems. <br/><br/>ICE said its Office of Detention Oversight inspects all facilities twice a year to see if they meet detention standards, and a third inspection is conducted each year by an outside contracted company called Nakamoto Group. The most recent inspection in Oct. 2021 rated Plymouth as “superior,” the highest ranking, though <a href=""https://www.ice.gov/doclib/facilityInspections/plymouthCoCorrFac_CL_06-10-2021.pdf"">contractor documents</a> shared with GBH News indicate some of last year’s inspections were conducted remotely, or with some inspectors working from home due to the pandemic, relying on photographs and videos of the facility. DHS did not respond to requests for comment. <br/><br/>Markey is not convinced that ICE detainees are getting “access to a safe, dignified, and lawful environment,” he said in a statement emailed to GBH News. “ICE officials and contractors must be transparent about how they treat people in their custody, and that’s why Senator Warren and I wrote to the agency this week to demand answers as to whether this facility is meeting DHS rules and regulations.”<br/><br/>The Plymouth County Sheriff’s Office denies the allegations. “We welcome the Senators’ interest in our facility,” said spokesperson John Birtwell. “In past years we have had a productive relationship. I am confident the claims described in the letter are unfounded. This is a safe, secure and modern facility staffed by humane men and women.” He says there are currently 140 ICE detainees at the facility. <br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1641427106762,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1641427106762,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-2c9d-d4b5-a5ff-ffbfe2530001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-2cad-ddaa-a77e-6fede96a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-2cad-ddaa-a77e-6fede9460000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">Screen Shot 2022-01-05 at 6.40.24 PM.png</bsp-image>Plymouth has a contract with ICE to hold the immigrant detainees, the only remaining Massachusetts county that does so after Essex and Franklin Counties severed their contracts and ICE terminated another with Bristol over detainee abuse allegations. <br/><br/>In the letters obtained by GBH News, one detainee said he hadn’t seen his young daughter in person since February 2020 and hasn’t had access to video visits. Others said they had witnessed or been part of fights in the jail, but never saw medical personnel evaluate or examine inmates to see if they sustained injuries. Several detainees said they were not given time or a designated space to practice Muslim faith. One claimed that when he cited this infraction of ICE rules this fall, he was thrown into solitary confinement. <br/><br/>In September, a group of 60 advocacy groups, including Boston Immigration Justice Accompaniment Network and Prisoners Legal Services, wrote a letter to ICE and Plymouth Sheriff Joseph McDonald detailing their concerns about the facilities and detainee treatment. <br/><br/>“People inside have kept speaking up, kept recording messages to share with the public, have kept speaking to their families, even under the threat of again physical assault by correctional officers, harassment, being put in solitary confinement, being transferred to other facilities and all, of course, under the threat of deportation,” said Elizabeth Nguyen, a volunteer with the Boston Immigration Justice Accompaniment Network.<br/><br/>In December, the ACLU filed a complaint in Superior Court on behalf of Michaell Acosta Granados, a 20-year-old ICE detainee who said he was sexually harassed by a fellow detainee and later physically attacked by another detainee. <br/><br/>Acosta, who was transferred to Plymouth last year, reported the sexual harassment incident to county authorities under the Prison Rape Elimination Act, and was interviewed by a county officer several times during the investigation. <br/><br/>Acosta says he was “savagely attacked without provocation” by another detainee on Sept. 12 who repeatedly screamed that he was a “rat” for reporting the sexual harassment by the other prisoner, according to attorneys and court documents. In the Superior Court complaint, Acosta&#39;s attorneys said he suffered “serious bodily injury” including pain to his spine, jaw, head, neck and mental health injuries, and cooperated with the investigation into the sexual harassment and physical attack. <br/><br/>His lawyers say the attack and his cooperation should have qualified him for a “U-visa,” which is available to immigrants who cooperate with an investigation or prosecution of a crime committed against them. But Plymouth officials denied his application and did not have a policy in place for reviewing U-visa applications, despite being required to do so by state law. <br/><br/>Acosta’s attorneys say Plymouth’s handing of Acosta’s visa application is an indication of the flawed systems at the facility.<br/><br/>Julie Dahlstrom of the Immigrants&#39; Rights and Human Trafficking Program at Boston University is one of Acosta’s attorneys, and she said Plymouth didn’t have a system in place to help immigrants who want a U-visa due to a crime committed against them. <br/><br/>“First of all, they don&#39;t have a policy pursuant to the state law,” Dahlstrom said. “Part of the law is to give victims notice that there will be a just, clear procedure for agencies to follow. That’s what we believe wasn&#39;t happening in this case. Plymouth didn&#39;t have a policy to when there was a victim in front of them who was savagely attacked.”<br/><br/>The Plymouth County Sheriff&#39;s office did not reply to inquiries about Acosta&#39;s case. According to court documents, the county has until mid-January to respond to the suit. ",Sarah Betancourt,Wed Jan 05 18:54:51 EST 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,Lani Guinier's legacy lives on in the people and policies she shaped,Lani Guinier's legacy lives on in the people and policies she shaped,"Lani Guinier, a civil rights lawyer, scholar and the first Black woman to be appointed to tenured professorship at Harvard Law School, died Friday at an assisted living facility in Cambridge, Mass., at the age of 71. Her legacy — as a monumental presence in the legal world and a voice against racial discrimination — lives on in the people she inspired and the policy changes she helped shape during her career. <br/><br/>“She was so insightful. She had this brilliant mind, and she was always forward-thinking on how to make ours a better society, how to make ours a better democracy,” Margaret Marshall, the first female Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Court, told GBH News. “She was a brilliant scholar, way ahead of her time. And also the most warm, generous, fun-loving, embracing person.” <br/><br/>As a professor, Guinier inspired her students to consider the power of their own lived experiences and the importance of applying those perspectives as leaders, according to Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, who studied under Guinier at Harvard Law School in 2010. <br/><br/>“Professor Lani Guinier changed my life. She really opened my eyes to how much impact we can have just from the mere fact of recognizing how interconnected we are and that we have the power collectively to shift our systems,” Wu told GBH News. “I, like generations of students before and after me, are part of her legacy of really investing in young people and making sure each and every one of us had the chance to deeply reflect and step into our own impact.”<br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1641762594783,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1641762594783,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;migration.alignment&quot;:&quot;RIGHT&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-40aa-d4b5-a5ff-dbaac5870001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-40aa-da64-a77e-6fffb66c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:&quot;/enhancement/EnhancementRight.hbs&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-40aa-da64-a77e-6fffb6330000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">Lani Guinier 1994</bsp-image><br/>Guinier became the first woman of color appointed to a tenured professorship at Harvard Law School when she joined the faculty in 1998. She came from the faculty at the University of Pennsylvania’s law school, where she taught for a decade. She had previously led the voting rights project at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund in the 1980s and served during President Jimmy Carter’s administration in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, which she was later nominated to lead. She died due to complications with Alzheimer’s disease, according to her cousin, Sherrie Russell-Brown. <br/><br/>“I have always wanted to be a civil rights lawyer. This lifelong ambition is based on a deep-seated commitment to democratic fair play — to playing by the rules as long as the rules are fair. When the rules seem unfair, I have worked to change them, not subvert them,” Guinier wrote in her 1994 book, “Tyranny of the Majority: Fundamental Fairness in Representative Democracy.”<br/><br/>Guinier joined the NAACP Legal Defense Fund in 1981, eventually becoming head of its Voting Rights Project. At the LDF, Guinier won 31 of the 32 cases she tried, according to the NAACP, and worked on the extension of the Voting Rights Act in 1982. She was renowned for her scholarship at Harvard, including “<u><a href=""http://www.beacon.org/The-Tyranny-of-the-Meritocracy-P1168.aspx"" target=""_blank"">The Tyranny of the Meritocracy</a></u>,” <u><a href=""https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674010840"" target=""_blank"">“The Miner’s Canary: Enlisting Race, Resisting Power, Transforming Democracy</a></u>,” “<u><a href=""https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Lift-Every-Voice/Lani-Guinier/9780743253512"" target=""_blank"">Lift Every Voice</a></u>” and “<u><a href=""http://www.beacon.org/Becoming-Gentlemen-P342.aspx"" target=""_blank"">Becoming Gentlemen: Women, Law School, and Institutional Change</a></u>.” <br/><br/>President Bill Clinton nominated Guinier to lead the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division in 1993, but he withdrew her nomination just two months later after <u><a href=""https://dolearchivecollections.ku.edu/collections/press_releases/930520gun.pdf"" target=""_blank"">conservative critics</a></u> called her views “extreme” and “hostile” and labeled her “<u><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/27/magazine/whos-afraid-of-lani-guinier.html"" target=""_blank"">the quota queen</a></u>.” Though Guinier said she had been mischaracterized, Clinton said he hadn’t read her academic writing before nominating her and wouldn’t have done so if he had, describing her views as “anti-democratic” and “very difficult to defend.” <br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1641761996318,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1641761996318,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-40a3-da64-a77e-6ff7a0b60001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-40a3-ddaa-a77e-4be794a00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-40a3-ddaa-a77e-4be794640000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">Clinton Nominates Lani Guinier For AAG 1993</bsp-image><br/>“She was a target of just the most evil right-wing voices, and yet she never cracked. She just held her head high with the kind of elegance and grace that I recall decades later being so impressed by,” Marshall told GBH News. “She rejected the criticism that was leveled against her, and she never apologized, never went back and said, ‘Oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t understand the full implications of what I was writing.’ In other words, she wasn’t arrogant. She just knew what her values were.”<br/><br/>Guinier described enduring “the personal humiliation of being vilified as a madwoman with strange hair — you know what that means — a strange name and strange ideas, ideas like democracy, freedom and fairness that mean all people must be equally represented in our political process,” in an NAACP address one month after her nomination was retracted. “But lest any of you feel sorry for me, according to press reports the president still loves me. He just won’t give me a job.”<br/><br/>Guinier’s views have become more mainstream in recent years, including anti-bias measures, implicit bias training and the role of representation as more than just putting Black faces in positions of leadership. <br/><br/>“Black electoral success theory romanticizes Black elected officials as empowerment role models. By ignoring problems of tokenism and false consciousness, the theory promotes Black electoral success in order to legitimize the ideology of ‘equality of opportunity,’” Guinier wrote in a controversial article from 1991, calling on Black elected officials to demonstrate solidarity with the Black community. “Even in jurisdictions with proportionate Black representation, Black electoral success has neither mobilized the Black community nor realized the promised community-based reforms.” <br/><br/>Boston City Councilor Ruthzee Louijeune says having Guinier as a professor at Harvard Law School in 2013 shaped the ways she approaches leadership as an elected official and as a Black woman in politics. <br/><br/>“It’s one thing to have a professor who’s studied voting rights and who has thought about it. It’s another thing to have a professor who, as a Black woman, has faced the challenges of being historically excluded and really is trying to think outside of the box about what representation should look like, what it could look like and how we sort of bind ourselves to these systems even when they’re imperfect,” Louijeune told GBH News. “She taught me how to be imaginative about creating structures that give voices to people who have been historically excluded.”<br/><bsp-tweet data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1641761939895,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1641761939895,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;tweet&quot;:{&quot;embedCode&quot;:&quot;%3Cblockquote%20class%3D%22twitter-tweet%22%3E%3Cp%20lang%3D%22en%22%20dir%3D%22ltr%22%3ESo%20much%20loss.%20Professor%20Lani%20Guinier%20was%20a%20giant.%20At%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FHarvard_Law%3Fref_src%3Dtwsrc%255Etfw%22%3E%40Harvard_Law%3C%2Fa%3E%20I%20felt%20*so*%20lucky%20to%20learn%20from%20her%20genius%20on%20voting%20rights%20%26amp%3B%20democracy.%20She%20influenced%20my%20work%20in%20the%20field%20%26amp%3B%20how%20I%20think%20about%20representation.%20She%E2%80%99s%20left%20an%20indelible%20mark%20on%20this%20world.%20Prayers%20for%20her%20family.%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Ft.co%2FVZ8ILMyUfA%22%3Epic.twitter.com%2FVZ8ILMyUfA%3C%2Fa%3E%3C%2Fp%3E%26mdash%3B%20Ruthzee%20Louijeune%20%28%40ruthzee4boston%29%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fruthzee4boston%2Fstatus%2F1479554848572035077%3Fref_src%3Dtwsrc%255Etfw%22%3EJanuary%207%2C%202022%3C%2Fa%3E%3C%2Fblockquote%3E%20%3Cscript%20async%20src%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fplatform.twitter.com%2Fwidgets.js%22%20charset%3D%22utf-8%22%3E%3C%2Fscript%3E&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-40a2-ddaa-a77e-4be6945e0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a3c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-40a2-ddaa-a77e-4be6306b0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a3c0002&quot;}"">Tweet</bsp-tweet><br/>As the first woman of color elected mayor of Boston, Wu says she continues to apply lessons from Guinier into the ways she approaches policy-making and connecting with communities across the city. <br/><br/>“Our public services that we offer, the programs and supports and policies that we’re implementing, often aren’t meeting people where they are, and are often are forcing people to leave behind parts of themselves and their lived experiences and not reaching all parts of our community,” Wu told GBH News. “When we think about that from all directions and really understand how intersectional our challenges are and our communities are, it actually can deliver the changes that we need.” <br/><br/>NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund head Sherrilyn Ifill called Guinier “my mentor” and a “scholar of uncompromising brilliance” <a href=""https://twitter.com/Sifill_LDF/status/1479544055965040641"" target=""_blank"">in a tweet on Friday</a>. <br/><br/>“Her scholarship changed our understanding of democracy — of why and how the voices of the historically underrepresented must be heard and what it takes to have a meaningful right to vote.

It was New York City’s deadliest fire in three decades.<br/><br/>Trapped residents broke windows for air and stuffed wet towels under doors as smoke rose from a lower-floor apartment where the fire started.

Some people “could not escape because of the volume of smoke,” he said. More than five dozen people were hurt and 13 people were hospitalized in critical condition. The fire commissioner said most of the victims had severe smoke inhalation.<br/><br/>Mayor Eric Adams praised FDNY firefighters for continuing to make rescues even after their oxygen tanks had run out.<br/><br/>Stefan Ringel, a senior adviser to Adams, said the children who died were 16 years old or younger. Adams said at a news conference that many residents were originally from the West African nation of Gambia.<br/><br/>One man who was pulled to safety said he&#39;d initially scoffed when the fire alarm went off, saying he&#39;d become numb to them because of frequent false alarms at the apartment tower.<br/><br/>Nigro said investigators found the fire &quot;started in a malfunctioning electric space heater” in an apartment unit spanning the second and third floors of the 19-story building. The door to the apartment and a door to a stairwell were left open, letting smoke quickly spread throughout the building, Nigro said.<br/><br/>Building resident Sandra Clayton said she ran for her life when she saw the hallway filling with black smoke and heard people screaming, “Get out! Get out!”<br/><br/>Clayton, 61, said she groped her way down a darkened stairway, clutching her dog in her arms. The smoke was so thick and black that she couldn’t see, but she could tell there were other tenants nearby because she heard their panicked wails and crying.<br/><br/>Her dog, Mocha, slipped from her arms in the commotion and was later found dead in the stairwell.<br/><br/>“I just ran down the steps as much as I could but people was falling all over me, screaming,” Clayton recounted from a hospital where she was treated for smoke inhalation.<br/><br/>About 200 firefighters responded to the building on East 181st Street around 11 a.m. Sunday.<br/><br/>Building resident Luis Rosa also thought the it was a false alarm at first, but when a notification popped up on his phone, he and his mother began to worry. By then, smoke began wafting into his 13th-floor apartment and he heard sirens in the distance.<br/><br/>He opened the front door, but the smoke had gotten too thick for an escape, he said.<br/><br/>“Once I opened the door, I couldn’t even see that far down the hallway,” Rosa told The Associated Press. “So I said, OK, we can’t run down the stairs because if we run down the stairs, we’re going to end up suffocating.”<br/><br/>“All we could do was wait,” he said.<br/><br/>Another resident, Vernessa Cunningham said she raced home from church after getting an alert on her cellphone that the building was on fire.<br/><br/>“I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. I was in shock,” Cunningham, 60, said from a nearby school where some residents gathered. “I could see my apartment. The windows were all busted out. And I could see flames coming from the back of the building.&quot;<br/><br/>The 120-unit building in the Twin Parks North West complex was built in 1973 as part of a project to build modern, affordable housing in the Bronx.<br/><br/>The drab brown building looms over an intersection of smaller, aging brick buildings overlooking Webster Avenue, one of the Bronx’s main thoroughfares.<br/><br/>By Sunday afternoon, all that remained visible of the unit where the fire started was a gaping black hole where the windows had been blown out. Apartments as high as the 12th floor also had broken windows. The intersection was choked with police and fire vehicles, and onlookers were still snapping cellphone pictures of the structure as darkness fell.<br/><br/>“There’s no guarantee that there’s a working fire alarm in every apartment, or in every common area,&quot; U.S. Rep.

That could change — twice — in the coming weeks.<br/><br/>Gov. Charlie Baker on Wednesday announced he would seek to commute the sentences of Thomas Koonce, a 54-year-old who has served 30 years in prison, and William Allen, a 48-year-old who has been in prison for 27 years.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1642031240742,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1642031240742,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-4af3-db0e-ab7f-6af3d8200003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-49c1-da64-a77e-6fd730290003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-4604-d6e5-af7f-477ea8f80003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-50ad-db0e-ab7f-78ad880a0023&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-50ad-db0e-ab7f-78ad87d70000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>Both men are serving life sentences without the possibility of parole following first-degree murder convictions, and Baker, who said the duo had taken responsibility for their actions and paid their debt to society, <a href=""https://www.statehousenews.com/content/docs/2022/01-12_Commutations.pdf"" style=""color: rgb(0, 106, 199); text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-skip-ink: none;"">formally recommended</a> reducing those sentences to second-degree murder.<br/><br/>If the Governor&#39;s Council approves the commutations, Koonce and Allen would become eligible for release on parole after decades behind bars. In interviews Wednesday with the News Service, at least five of the eight councilors -- Robert Jubinville, Paul DePalo, Marilyn Devaney, Terrence Kennedy and Eileen Duff -- praised Baker&#39;s commutation recommendations, indicating the panel appears likely to give its approval.<br/><br/>&quot;The authority given to me by the people of Massachusetts to commute and pardon individuals is one of the most sacred and important powers of this office,&quot; Baker said in a statement. &quot;There are few things as important to me in this position as ensuring justice is served for the individuals impacted by a crime and my responsibility to ensure fair application of justice to all. To make these difficult decisions, I spent months carefully weighing the circumstances of the two terrible crimes, the actions of the two men since and the Parole Board&#39;s recommendation for commutation.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I believe both men, having taken responsibility for their actions and paid their debt to the Commonwealth by serving sentences longer than most individuals found guilty of similar actions, deserve the right to seek parole from prison,&quot; Baker continued, &quot;I hope the Governor&#39;s Council carefully weighs the facts of these cases as well as the undeniable impact on the families involved and reaches the same decision.&quot;<br/><br/>Allen, in a statement published by the Massachusetts Communities Action Network, thanked Baker and other officials &quot;for believing in me.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I promise I will never let you down,&quot; he said.<br/><br/>Governor&#39;s Councilor Christopher Iannella, who will preside over the commutation hearings, which have not been scheduled, said Wednesday that he wants to talk to fellow members and to the Parole Board but &quot;should be prepared next week to set a date&quot; for the events.<br/><br/>A Bristol Superior Court jury convicted Koonce of first-degree murder in 1992, stemming from a July 20, 1987 incident when he fired a gun out the window of a moving car in New Bedford during a fight between young adults from that city and Brockton, killing Mark Santos.<br/><br/>Koonce, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, <a href=""https://law.justia.com/cases/massachusetts/supreme-court/volumes/418/418mass367.html"" style=""color: rgb(0, 106, 199); text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-skip-ink: none;"">testified</a> that he had not aimed at Santos or anyone else but had intended to fire the weapon into the sky.<br/><br/>During his time in prison, according to Baker&#39;s office, Koonce has taken advantage of rehabilitation resources and helped launch a restorative justice program at MCI-Norfolk to help other inmates. He earned a bachelor&#39;s degree, magna cum laude, from Boston University&#39;s prison education program, and has remained active in his church and in employment while incarcerated.<br/><br/>Allen was convicted of first-degree murder in 1997 for his joint participation in a robbery on Feb. 8, 1994. He and another man, Rolando Perry, broke into the Brockton apartment of Purvis Bester, where Perry fatally stabbed Bester.<br/><br/>Perry pleaded guilty to second-degree murder, and he was released from incarceration on parole about a decade ago. However, Allen declined to accept a plea for a second-degree murder charge, and he was convicted on a first-degree charge that carried a life sentence without parole.<br/><br/>Robert Jubinville, a criminal defense attorney and member of the Governor&#39;s Council, on Wednesday recalled that he represented Allen at his trial. He said he was unsuccessful in his attempts to convince Allen to agree to the deal.<br/><br/>&quot;I couldn&#39;t get Allen to take the second. He just said, &#39;I didn&#39;t kill anybody.&#39; I said, I know that, but when you&#39;re a joint venturer, whatever he does, you&#39;re responsible for, too. Couldn&#39;t get that in his head,&quot; Jubinville said.<br/><br/>Jubinville said he asked Allen&#39;s father to try and sway him, but that, too, fell short.<br/><br/>&quot;He comes out and the father said, &#39;God will take care of him.&#39; I went, &#39;Oh my God.&#39; I said, &#39;The problem, though, is God isn&#39;t on the jury,&#39;&quot; Jubinville said in an interview. &quot;He had such a nice smile. He was really a decent kid.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I couldn&#39;t get him to take (the plea), so I had to get elected to the Governor&#39;s Council to get him out this way,&quot; Jubinville later added.<br/><br/>Several members of the council, including Jubinville, said they visited Koonce and Allen in correctional facilities, commending both for their dispositions and work they did while incarcerated to improve themselves.<br/><br/>&quot;This is what the system&#39;s designed to do,&quot; DePalo said. &quot;We want this to happen. Rehabilitation, someone who&#39;s engaged in a lot of self-improvement, taking advantage of what opportunities there are while incarcerated. I think it&#39;s a sign of success for the system.&quot;<br/><br/>The state Advisory Board of Pardons reviewed petitions in both cases and recommended that the governor commute the sentences of Koonce and Allen to second-degree murder.<br/><br/>Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito, who presides over most Governor&#39;s Council assemblies, said Wednesday that the administration&#39;s <a href=""https://www.statehousenews.com/content/docs/2021/09-20_Baker_Celemency_Guidelines.pdf"" style=""color: rgb(0, 106, 199); text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-skip-ink: none;"">executive clemency guidelines</a> released in February 2020 called for a decision on recommendations within about a year.<br/><br/>Asked about possible opposition from Virginia Santos, the mother of Koonce&#39;s victim, Polito replied that administration officials would work with the family &quot;to help them feel as we do that this is the right course of action.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It&#39;s not easy for them, it&#39;s not an easy decision for our administration, and yet at the same time, this is what we feel is the right course of action,&quot; Polito told reporters.<br/><br/>The commutation recommendations are Baker&#39;s first since he took office in 2015 and, if awarded, would represent only the second and third time since the 1990s that Massachusetts officials have commuted an inmate&#39;s sentence, according to Governor&#39;s Council records.<br/><br/>In decades past, governors pursued commutations at a far higher rate. Between 1973 and 1979, the Governor&#39;s Council approved a total of 70 commutation recommendations -- including 16 per year in 1975 and 1978 -- it received from Govs. Francis Sargent, Michael Dukakis and Edward King.<br/><br/>Twenty-five of the commutations in that span were for first-degree murder convictions, and more than two dozen others were for second-degree murder convictions.<br/><br/>Their frequency slowed in the 1980s and 1990s and all but vanished with the turn of the millennium. Before the Council commuted the drug-related prison sentence of Deanne Hamilton <a href=""https://statehousenews.com/news/20142218"" style=""color: rgb(0, 106, 199); text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-skip-ink: none;"">in 2014</a> at the recommendation of Gov. Deval Patrick, the most recent commutation was in 1997, when Gov. Bill Weld <a href=""https://statehousenews.com/news/199740"" style=""color: rgb(0, 106, 199); text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-skip-ink: none;"">secured commutation</a> for first-degree convicted murderer Joseph Salvati.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#39;s about time,&quot; Duff said of Baker&#39;s latest recommendations. &quot;We are wasting hundreds of thousands of dollars every year incarcerating people who really shouldn&#39;t be incarcerated. This isn&#39;t just great criminal justice and social justice, this is a really great economic move.&quot;<br/><br/>Duff recalled that the most recent commutation hearing in 2014 was a &quot;contentious&quot; affair, but said she believes the climate for debate has evolved.<br/><br/>&quot;I think people have grown a lot since then in understanding criminal justice reform, in understanding redemption, in understanding what the purpose of jail and prison really is,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#39;s not to ruin somebody for the rest of their life.&quot;<br/><br/>Plymouth County District Attorney Timothy Cruz, who today leads the office that prosecuted Allen, on Wednesday said &quot;a number of changes over the last 27 years required us to revisit whether the sentence imposed at the outcome of Mr. Allen&#39;s trial remained just today.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We consulted with the victim, Purvis Bester&#39;s family, and most supported Mr. Allen&#39;s commutation request,&quot; Cruz said in a statement. &quot;The law of felony murder has changed, and looking at Mr. Allen&#39;s growth as an individual, it was undeniable that he took countless steps toward rehabilitating himself and giving back to others. It is a weighty duty to ultimately determine whether Mr. Allen&#39;s sentence was to be commuted, and we respect Governor Baker&#39;s decision.&quot;<br/><br/>Jubinville said he has also heard of support for Allen&#39;s commutation from the original prosecutor in the case, Paul Dawley, who is now chief justice of the District Court, as well as former Plymouth County District Attorney Michael Sullivan.<br/><br/>Allen&#39;s commutation push had drawn substantial attention ahead of the administration&#39;s decision, including support from several members of his victim&#39;s family <a href=""https://statehousenews.com/news/20211741"" style=""color: rgb(0, 106, 199); text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-skip-ink: none;"">and from</a> New England Patriots safety Devin McCourty, who on Wednesday declared in a statement, &quot;This accomplishment is the greatest team victory I&#39;ve ever been a part of.&quot;<br/><br/>On Thursday, the Second Chance Justice group and several of Allen&#39;s family members plan to host a press conference to discuss the commutation recommendation. They will gather at 28 Custer St. in Brockton, where Allen&#39;s father and stepmother live and where Allen plans to reside if he secures parole.<br/>",Chris Lisinski and Sam Doran | State House News Service,Wed Jan 12 18:50:37 EST 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,School superintendent accuses Everett mayor of having a racist agenda,School superintendent accuses Everett mayor of having a racist agenda,"At Everett&#39;s school committee meeting on Tuesday, Michael McLaughlin insisted that when he filed a motion to strip the city&#39;s first school superintendent of color from her role as secretary of the school committee, it wasn’t a bid to curtail the superintendent’s power.<br/><br/>McLaughlin, a former city councilor and newly elected school committee member, said he was only trying to help. <br/><br/>“There’s no question that her role, responsibility and duties have changed drastically throughout this past few years as the pandemic has rolled on,” he said. “If we can look at this as a possibility to help relieve some of that stress and pressure.”<br/><br/>School Superintendent Priya Tahiliani said she is handling the pressure of two school committee meetings per month. <br/><br/>“I believe that’s part of my duties in serving this district and it’s really important for me to be part of these meetings,” she said. “I think providing you all with information, updates, answers to your questions — I do not believe that at all to be taking away from, but rather part of, and enhancing my jobs as the superintendent of schools.”<br/><br/>Tahiliani’s tone was cordial, but one day earlier she had filed a 31-page complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination accusing McLaughlin of being “a crony” to Everett Mayor Carlo DeMaria in an effort to push her out of her job.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1642615063602,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1642615063602,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000178-dbad-dbb7-a7ff-dbefb9070002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000177-b23c-d411-a977-fb3f0b490003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-e39a-d982-a77d-ebdaaa290003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-737a-d440-a17f-73fe340d0020&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-737a-d440-a17f-73fe333c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>Trying to oust her from the school committee, Tahiliani said in the complaint, was illegal and part of a pattern of discriminatory behavior against her since she took the job in December 2019. She said that behavior includes the mayor withholding school funding, ignoring Tahiliani and instead inviting white male subordinates to share information at school committee meetings, and accusing her of hating white people when she hired people of color into high level positions.<br/><br/>According to the complaint, McLaughlin filed a Freedom of Information Act to request access to notes that led to the hiring of a newly created chief of equity role, among other positions.<br/><br/>In a district where more than 80% of the students are non-white, Tahiliani accuses the mayor of having a &quot;racist agenda.&quot;<br/><br/>“During his reelection campaign, Mayor DeMaria told School Committee members and EPS employees that they needed to &#39;get me out.&#39; He has publicly threatened staff to &#39;remember what team [they] are on,&#39;&quot; Tahiliani alleges in the MCAD complaint.<br/><br/>She points out that DeMaria has been Everett’s mayor since 2007 and always had a seat on the school committee, but it wasn’t until she became superintendent that he filed a home rule petition that would allow him to cast a vote on the committee. Her predecessor, Frederick Foresteire, is a white man who held the superintendent job for 30 years until he was forced to resign abruptly after several women accused him of sexual assault.<br/><br/>This is not the first time a high-profile woman of color has clashed with Everett’s mayor. Gerly Adrien, Everett’s first Black city councilor, last year accused DeMaria of <a href=""https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/02/08/opinion/black-woman-politics-i-belong-here/"">verbally attacking her during a remote meeting</a>. <br/><br/>Adrien joined the public comment period at the beginning of the school committee meeting Tuesday night to offer support for Tahiliani.<br/><br/>“I truly support her and I don’t like what I’m seeing so far, especially when we have somebody who decided to come here to work and put our students first,” said Adrien. ”To see the actions that the school committee wants to bring forth tonight, it’s sad and it’s frustrating. And it’s disappointing.”<br/><br/>DeMaria was not at the Tuesday night meeting when McLaughlin walked back several proposals that other school committee members questioned as potentially illegal or beyond the scope of the committee, including requesting a hiring plan from the superintendent. His proposal to remove the superintendent from the job of school committee secretary was sent to committee. <br/><br/>Citing a pending legal matter, DeMaria&#39;s office declined comment.

Article,Tufts Medical Center plans to close its children's hospital,Tufts Medical Center plans to close its children's hospital,"<i>Updated at 2:04 p.m. on Jan. 21</i><br/><br/>Tufts Medical Center plans to close its children&#39;s hospital this summer, and convert those 41 beds to serve adults.<br/><br/>Michael Tarnoff, president and CEO of Tufts Medical Center, said the children&#39;s hospital&#39;s fate has been in question for a while, and that the hospital is facing high demand for beds as more adult patients require specialized care. Wellforce, the hospital&#39;s parent company, reached an agreement to send pediatric patients who are in need of inpatient care to Boston Children&#39;s Hospital in a little over five months, if it receives the necessary state approvals. The announcement devastated staff and concerned families who have questions about what this news means for their children&#39;s care.<br/><br/>&quot;This is not happening tomorrow. This is not happening next month, we&#39;re planning this over a period of months so that there&#39;s a thoughtful transition,&quot; Tarnoff told reporters at a press briefing Thursday. &quot;We need to maintain access to care for our community and pediatrics and adults. And this will all help solidify that.&quot;<br/><br/>Tarnoff said the news of the closure is hard for the hospital community.<br/><br/>&quot;I would describe it as some agony,&quot; he said. &quot;People love this place. People love this institution. People love working here. ... So this comes with a lot of heartache. It comes with a lot of sadness.&quot;<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1642719309414,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1642719309414,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-81a1-d0ab-a17d-cbffe7160003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-5075-db0e-ab7f-78f592930003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-40d5-d4b5-a5ff-dbf7e7be0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-79b1-d8b0-adfe-7ff18b97001d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-79b1-d8b0-adfe-7ff18ac90000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>But just because it&#39;s a difficult decision, he said, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the wrong decision. The change is necessary, Tarnoff said, because of an increase in adult patients in need of specialized medical care — something he said is not the result of the COVID-19 pandemic. He said the medical center usually has 50% to 75% of pediatric beds in use, while many times all of the adult beds are occupied. <br/><br/>&quot;These demands on Tufts Medical Center were here even pre-pandemic. They&#39;ve just been intensified,&quot; Tarnoff said. &quot;And this question of the scale, the size, the depth and the breadth of our children&#39;s hospital — as high quality of care as it provides and as its heart is — has been a longstanding question.&quot;<br/><br/>For many who have lived in the region for a while, Tufts Children&#39;s Hospital is more commonly thought of as the &quot;Floating Hospital for Children,&quot; a throwback to its<a href=""https://forum-network.org/lectures/how-harbor-barge-changed-pediatric-medicine/""> founding in 1894 as a ship</a> commissioned to bring sick children out onto the harbor for fresh air and medical treatment.<br/><br/>&quot;While we can be sensitive and honor the history, we also have to be forward-thinking and really thoughtful about what the community needs the most from us and where care is best situated in different situations,&quot; Tarnoff said.<br/><br/>Tufts plans to continue operating its pediatric primary care services and neo-natal intensive care unit.<br/><br/>Tufts Children&#39;s Hospital also partners with hundreds of pediatricians&#39; offices around the state, and the announcement has caused concern among some patient families that those resources could be lost.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#39;ve been in contact with them,&quot; Tarnoff said of the hospital&#39;s pediatrician partners. &quot;The reliance on us as an inpatient facility is what will change.&quot;<br/><br/>Tufts will continue to partner with pediatricians, Tarnoff said, but after the transition, patients will go to Boston Children&#39;s Hospital if they need to be admitted to a hospital.<br/><br/><b>Watch: How a harbor barge changed pediatric medicine</b><bsp-video data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1642719619874,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1642719619874,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;video&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-79b7-d395-a37f-79bfed380001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a2f0008&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-79b7-d395-a37f-79bfd6b50000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a300000&quot;}"">How a Harbor Barge Changed Pediatric Medicine</bsp-video><br/><br/>In a written statement, Boston Children’s Hospital President and CEO Kevin Churchwell emphasized his hospital&#39;s commitment to pediatric patients.<br/><br/>“When the leadership of Wellforce approached us with this potential collaboration, we recognized the important positive impact it could have on improving not only pediatric health, but adult health as well,&quot; he said in the statment. &quot;We look forward to collaborating with Tufts Medical Center to provide a full range of care to pediatric patients, including inpatient care that cannot be provided in a community hospital setting.”<br/><br/>Tarnoff said Tufts Medical Center will work to ensure that any employees whose jobs are eliminated by the change are able to find positions elsewhere in the Tufts system or at Boston Children&#39;s Hospital.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#39;s not certain what is going to become of everybody,&quot; said Mary Havlicek Cornacchia, a staff nurse in the operating room, and chairperson of the nurses&#39; union bargaining unit at Tufts. &quot;I know that we are working closely with Boston Children&#39;s Hospital for transition collaboration. So hopefully all of these staff people will be placed appropriately.&quot;<br/><br/>Havlicek Cornacchia has worked at Tufts Medical Center for more than 33 years, and said the news of the closure is devastating to staff.<br/><br/>&quot;We honestly feel like we&#39;ve been kicked in the stomach,&quot; she said. &quot;I can&#39;t put it a different way, and I think if they had done that, it would feel better than what it feels like right now. You know, nurses have given their their blood, sweat and tears to this facility, and some of them have been there for as long as I have, or longer. So to suddenly learn that this is not the place that you may continue working after July is just devastating.&quot;<br/><br/>Cornacchia said she&#39;s concerned that some patients whose insurance plans cover Tufts Children&#39;s Hospital as an in-network hospital may not have the same coverage at Boston Children&#39;s Hospital.<br/><br/>&quot;That would be one thing for sure that I&#39;d be concerned about, to make sure that that every patient has a place to go,&quot; she said.<br/><br/>A spokesperson for Tufts Medical Center said hospital leadership will be working out the insurance issue in the coming months.<br/><br/>For the families of some Tufts patients, the news has created a sense of troubling uncertainty. <br/><br/>Suzanne Gilleece of Methuen has two sons who have severe hemophilia A, a genetic bleeding disorder. They&#39;re now 19 and 17 years old, and have been patients at Tufts&#39; pediatric hematology oncology clinic their entire lives.<br/><br/>&quot;The care has been phenomenal,&quot; Gilleece said. &quot;It&#39;s very much a family-centered clinic, and everyone knows everyone.&quot;<br/><br/>Now, it&#39;s not clear if the clinic will remain open. A spokesperson for Tufts Medical Center told GBH News that the hospital is in discussions with Boston Children&#39;s Hospital on how best to structure the future of Tufts&#39; pediatric subspecialty ambulatory clinics.<br/><br/>That uncertainty has left Gilleece reeling.<br/><br/>&quot;Part of me thinks that they should have not announced it yet until they had worked everything out,&quot; she said. &quot;Because it is causing people to be upset and now parents are now like, &#39;Well, what do we do now? Where do we go from here?&#39; But we don&#39;t know anything to do anything. You know, I don&#39;t know if any of the doctors are staying. I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re going other places. I don&#39;t know.&quot;<br/><br/><i>This story was updated to include Tarnoff&#39;s comments about Tufts Children&#39;s Hospital&#39;s partnerships with pediatricians&#39; offices.</i>",Craig LeMoult,Thu Jan 20 17:55:20 EST 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the survey results, the school board is weighing three proposals: keep the calendar as it is, add Lunar New Year and Eid al Fitr or eliminate all days off for religious holidays. <br/><br/>Schools currently take off for Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Diwali and Good Friday, as well as all federal holidays, which include Christmas. <br/><br/>The board debated the proposal at its meeting last week, and plans to vote at its next meeting on Feb. 3.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1642975092269,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017b-7ea9-d5a5-a37f-feef3eab0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1642975092269,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017b-7ea9-d5a5-a37f-feef3eab0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-a946-dd9e-abfe-ab6fe4490003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000016b-3efa-dab5-a37f-7ffedc200003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000179-43c9-de59-a579-cfe9163f0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-88f1-d395-a37f-88fd32830021&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-88f1-d395-a37f-88fd2ffa0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>Superintendent Carol Cavanaugh supports the proposal to add two more holidays to the school calendar. She thinks disruption to the school year will be minimal because some holidays will fall on weekends year to year, and that occasional additional days off will promote student mental health. <br/><br/>Cavanaugh also worries about students who might want to take off for holidays but feel pressured to come to school so they do not fall behind.<br/><br/>“Our kids sometimes will say, ‘I would love to have been at home ... but I didn’t take the time because of academic stress and pressure,’” Cavanaugh said. “Sometimes they do take it and even while they’re trying to observe a religious or cultural event, it’s stressful for them.”<br/><br/>Still, some members of the school board worry about learning disruptions, and would prefer to see schools give no days off for religious holidays, rather than add days off. <br/><br/>“I’m thinking about all those kids whose rhythms are continually disrupted by, say, the many holidays we have this fall, especially kids with disabilities or who have so-called special needs. And so where are they in this equation?” said School Committee member Meg Tyler at the board meeting last Thursday. “I do understand people have great faiths and spiritual lives, which are profound and meaningful, but we are a public educational institution.”<br/><br/>Proponents of the plan argued at the board meeting that eliminating all religious holidays would also be disruptive to education because schools could end up having large swaths of teachers and students out for major holidays. <br/><br/>Student representative Jessica Ianelli added that many students support the calendar proposal. “Inclusivity is a value that is very strongly held among the student population,” she said at the meeting last week. <br/><br/>Hopkinton Teachers Association President Becky Abate views potential calendar changes as just a first step when it comes to inclusivity in a district that has rapidly diversified and in a nation reckoning with race.<br/><br/>“We can talk about being inclusive, but if it doesn’t feel inclusive in the schools, then that’s something that has to be addressed,” she said. “I think perhaps there&#39;s some bigger issues that need to be addressed, that really aren’t going to necessarily be addressed by changing the calendar, but it’s certainly, I guess, a step in the right direction.”",Rebecca Tauber,Sun Jan 23 18:20:58 EST 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Same-day registration would allow unregistered but eligible voters to show up at a polling location on election day or during early voting hours, register and vote all at the same time.<br/><br/>Supporters say that based on data from other states the registration reform could boost turnout by as much as 10 percent across the state, and have an even bigger impact in low-income, Black and Hispanic communities. Secretary of State William Galvin, who is seeking reelection, and Attorney General Maura Healey, who is running for governor, both support the reform, as do many of the other candidates in both those races.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#39;s pretty devastating to not have same-day registration in there,&quot; said Rep. Tami Gouveia, an Acton Democrat and candidate for lieutenant governor.<br/><br/>&quot;We know there are a lot of ways people feel excluded from our electoral process and this is a way to allow voters to have a voice in the process, particularly knowing Massachusetts is one of the states that has more students coming to live here for four years and hopefully staying here,&quot; Gouveia said.<br/><br/>At least 20 states and the District of Columbia already use some type of same-day registration, including Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. Senate President Karen Spilka, in a GBH radio interview on Tuesday, said Massachusetts has fallen behind.<br/><br/>&quot;Too bad. We should have been number one, or earlier, but at least we should be doing it,&quot; Spilka said, adding, &quot;I believe we should be doing anything to help people who want to vote vote.&quot;<br/><br/>Gouveia said that while the bill has &quot;a lot of elements we were looking for,&quot; the exclusion of same-day registration would leave renters, students and those with inadequate housing &quot;out in the dust.<br/><br/>&quot;I think some of it is to protect incumbency. I think some of it is status quo. This is how we&#39;ve always done things,&quot; Gouveia said.<br/><br/>The House Ways and Means Committee voted 18-8-1 to advance the bill on Thursday, with seven of the eight Republicans on the panel voting against it and Rep. Nika Elugardo of Boston casting the lone Democratic no vote. A full breakdown of the vote was not available.<br/><br/>Rep. Peter Durant, a Spencer Republican, said he did not feel the 45 minutes committee members were given to review and vote on the new bill was enough time.<br/><br/>While Durant said he was still reviewing the bill, he plans to file an amendment that would prevent cities and towns with vaccine mandates to enter certain buildings from enforcing those if they would impact someone&#39;s ability to access a polling location. Durant also said he&#39;s not necessarily opposed to same-day registration, but has concerns about its implementation and election integrity.<br/><br/>&quot;What bothers me is we have no clear way of making sure voters are not registered and voting in two locations on the same day,&quot; Durant said. &quot;We want everybody to vote, but we want them to only vote once and we want to make sure they&#39;re eligible to vote.&quot;<br/><br/>Ella McDonald, communications director for Act on Mass., said House lawmakers have a vested interest in resisting anything that would boost turnout among populations that could challenge their grip on their seats.<br/><br/>&quot;I think it&#39;s important to look critically at the fact that in a state that has a ton of protections for incumbents and one of the lowest rates in the country of primary challengers winning elections, it&#39;s really telling that we&#39;re not able to get same-day voter registration,&quot; McDonald said.<br/><br/>A November 2021 poll conducted by the University of Massachusetts Amherst found that 65 percent of residents support same-day registration, compared to 28 percent who are opposed. That same poll found 64 percent in favor of voting-by-mail.<br/><br/>The bill would establish detailed procedures for voting-by-mail, including the dissemination and return of ballot applications and actual ballots. It would also expand in-person early voting to include all biennial state elections and primaries, presidential primaries and special elections.<br/><br/>Early voting in the biennial state election, which is occurring this November, would begin the third Saturday prior to the election and run through the Friday before the Election Day, while the window would shorten to the second Saturday before the election for presidential and state primaries and special elections.<br/><br/>Cities and towns would be directed to allow early voting during normal business hours and all weekends during the early-voting period, though the number of weekend hours required would vary based on the size of the municipality.<br/><br/>Finally, the bill would seek to ensure that eligible incarcerated voters are given the information and access they need to register to vote and participate in elections.",Matt Murphy | State House News Service,Wed Jan 26 17:39:33 EST 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Holocaust Remembrance Day reminds us of that history.<br/><br/>During the Holocaust, six million Jews were killed. False equivalence and revisionism of that fact are not only hurtful to remaining Holocaust survivors, their families and friends, but also dismissive of the human carnage and crime against humanity. <br/><br/>In 2017, then-President Donald Trump&#39;s public statement commemorating International Holocaust Remembrance Day intentionally omitted any mention of Judaism, antisemitism or the Nazis&#39; systematic program exterminating European Jewry. While the president&#39;s generic statement on suffering might have been intended to be an all-inclusive acknowledgment of other groups killed — gays, Gypsies, political dissidents and non-Aryans, to name a few — by the Nazis, it did more harm than help. <br/><br/>At the ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz in 1995, Elie Wiesel stated it best: &quot;It is true that not all the victims were Jews. But all the Jews were victims.&quot; In other words, eliminating Jews was the central organizing principle for the rise of the Third Reich. The president&#39;s statement acknowledging the Holocaust and not mentioning Jews and antisemitism is similar to making a public statement acknowledging American slavery and not mentioning Blacks and racism. At worst, the statement bolsters an already existing worldwide population of Holocaust deniers and revisionist historians because it erases the unique stories of survival, bravery and resistance.<br/><br/>When Martin Luther King Jr. was invited to address the American Jewish Committee convention in 1958, he noted the significant similarities between Jews and African Americans, who both experienced hatred and prejudice.<br/><br/>&quot;My people were brought to America in chains. Your people were driven here to escape the chains fashioned for them in Europe,&quot; he said. &quot;Our unity is born of our common struggle for centuries, not only to rid ourselves of bondage, but to make oppression of any people by others an impossibility.&quot;<br/><br/>On Jan. 6, 2021, the day of the Capitol Insurrection, history was made in Georgia. Rafael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, a Black man and a Jewish man, respectively, won their Senate seats in the Bible Belt. In the Deep South, Jews could be lynched as Black men were; it was the lynching of Leo Frank in Georgia in 1915 that made many Jews conscious of the parallels.<br/><br/>However, antisemitism is so pervasive as to be invisible and normalized. One reason is that too often we de-historicize Jewish people from their suffering. For example, I know of Christians who love Jesus but hate Jewish people. I tell them it&#39;s similar to some white Christians revering MLK and former President Barack Obama, but they hate Black men. I remind these same people that Jesus was crucified because he was Jewish, and Emmett Till, Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery were killed because they were Black.<br/><br/>Antisemitism has also been fueled by racist Jewish tropes that won&#39;t cease until we confront them head-on. I remember when the Rev. Jesse Jackson&#39;s 1984 presidential campaign stopped in New York City. He referred to Jews as &quot;Hymies&quot; and the Big Apple as &quot;Hymietown.&quot; During Trump&#39;s presidential campaign, he was condemned by Jewish leaders for what appeared on his anti-Hillary Clinton poster the Star of David layered over $100 bills. Trump barked back, telling his critics the star was a sheriff&#39;s badge.<br/><br/>In &quot;People Love Dead Jews,&quot; the premise is that there&#39;s too little respect for Jewish lives unfolding in the present.<br/><br/>To stop antisemitism in society, we must stop it in ourselves.",Rev.

Article,Whoopi Goldberg is confused about the Holocaust. So are many other Americans.,Whoopi Goldberg is confused about the Holocaust. So are many other Americans.,"Conversations about race in America are our third rail. It trips us all up. Whoopi Goldberg proved that last week on the television talk show &quot;The View&quot; during a conversation about <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2022/01/31/why-a-school-boards-ban-on-maus-may-put-the-book-in-the-hands-of-more-readers"">a Tennessee school district banning &quot;Maus,&quot; a graphic novel about the Holocaust,</a> from its curriculum.<br/><br/>In her rebuke, Goldberg <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/whoopi-goldberg-apology-the-holocaust-jonathan-greenblatt-4a4c77055d7bb1c37662fc9b274a8869"" target=""_blank"">empathically stated the Holocaust was &quot;not about race.&quot;</a> She described the Holocaust as a form of sectarian violence when she said, &quot;These are two white groups of people.&quot;<br/><br/>Later that evening, in what was supposed to be Goldberg&#39;s public mea culpa moment, she further tripped herself up in the controversy by doubling down on her premise.<br/><br/>&quot;As a Black person, I think of race as being something that I can see. So, I see you, and I know what race you are,&quot; Goldberg said during <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdkhVQZGSSU"" target=""_blank"">an appearance on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.&quot;</a><br/><br/>Goldberg&#39;s faux pas — which itself occurred during a discussion about education — should have evolved into a prime teaching moment for America to have a robust conversation about the relationships between antisemitism, racism and whiteness.<br/><br/>Race is a social construct and not a biological fact. However, the deleterious effects of America&#39;s dominant Black/white racial paradigm exclude other racial groups whose skin color and phenotype complicate the racist model. <br/><br/>On &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,&quot; Goldberg further expounded that Jews are white and the Holocaust was &quot;white on white&quot; genocide. She illustrated a hypothetical situation in which white supremacists would be able to spot her visibly, but not a Jewish friend.<br/><br/>&quot;If the Klan is coming down the street … I&#39;m gonna run. But if my friend decides not to run, they&#39;ll get passed by most times, because you can&#39;t tell who&#39;s Jewish,&quot; Goldberg said. &quot;It&#39;s not something that people say, &#39;Oh that person is Jewish.&#39;&quot;<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1644345258210,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1644345258210,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000179-3c97-d2db-af7b-7d9f6de90004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-b14b-d8d4-a5ff-f94f3af10000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000172-1842-d78d-a57f-bd5eef390003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-da9b-d936-a37f-fafb9d530020&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-da9b-d936-a37f-fafb9c790000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>The actor lauds herself as a friend to the Jewish community because of her friendships, associations and stage name. However, one&#39;s allyship to a marginalized community doesn&#39;t mean it should go unchecked. Since this controversy, many are now querying Whoopi&#39;s appropriating a Jewish-sounding name. <br/><br/>Goldberg is an African American woman with no Jewish ancestry. She was born with the name Caryn Elaine Johnson and later adopted Whoopi Goldberg as her stage name because she identifies with Judaism. She <a href=""https://www.thejc.com/news/uk/whoopi-goldberg-i-m-jewish-and-i-talk-to-god-1.23000"" target=""_blank"">told a London audience in 2011</a>: &quot;I just know I am Jewish. I practice nothing. I don&#39;t go to temple, but I do remember the holidays.&quot; <br/><br/>Would this be reverse, many African Americans would want Whoopi to explain further. <br/><br/>While it is true that most Jews in America are Ashkenazic and predominately white-skinned, how we view race today in America is very different than how it was viewed in Europe during the Holocaust. As a matter of fact, America&#39;s racial caste system informed Nazi Germany. Both white America and Nazi Germany wanted to maintain racial purity. America&#39;s system of Jim Crow laws on anti-miscegenation criminalizing sex and marriage between blacks and whites laid the legal groundwork for banning Jewish and Aryan marriages, which the Nazis called &quot;rassenschande,&quot; which translates to &quot;race defilement.&quot; The Nuremberg Laws — the Reich Citizenship Law and the Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honor — were racist, antisemitic and separated Jews from society. <br/><br/>While it is also true that many European Jews have white skin like their oppressors, 92% of American Jews describe themselves as white, according to <a href=""https://www.pewforum.org/2021/05/11/jewish-americans-in-2020/"" target=""_blank"">a recent May 2021 Pew Research Center Poll</a>. From an American perspective on race, white as a racial category erases racial differences and the struggles of European immigrants like Hungarians, Italians, Irish, Greeks, etc. Noel Ignatiev&#39;s book &quot;How the Irish Became White&quot; illustrates how an oppressed group became part of a white racial class. <br/><br/>White privilege that America confers to white-skinned people obscures and complicates how some whites are harmed by an economic system that disempowers them and their support of public policies against the best interests of most people, including most whites.<br/><br/>The topic of race continues to be a messy one in this country. If Americans didn&#39;t know the Holocaust was about race, they do now. <br/><br/>I believe Goldberg&#39;s heartfelt apology and agree that she should be suspended from the show to reflect. Her confusion is ours, too. But sometimes, an apology is not enough. We must inform our thinking and change our actions. <br/><br/><i>The Rev.

Article,Push to expand daycare access continues in wake of failed federal expansion,Push to expand daycare access continues in wake of failed federal expansion,"At a Lawrence daycare run by a nonprofit called The Community Group, the talk of the day was &quot;Goldilocks&quot; and her legendary home invasion. <br/><br/>Now — much like the three bears&#39; chairs that Goldilocks tried before finding the one that fit just right — there are efforts at big, medium and small levels of government to make childcare like this more accessible to low-income and middle-class families.

But the state system leaves out many low-income and middle-class families who can&#39;t afford childcare. For families who do qualify for the state voucher, there&#39;s currently a <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2021/12/07/low-pay-for-day-care-workers-leads-to-a-worker-shortage-and-long-waitlists"">waitlist of 15,000 children</a>.<br/><br/>But many families who can&#39;t afford daycare don&#39;t qualify for help.

And for families on the state’s waiting list, the scholarship can serve as a bridge to get them daycare until they get that state voucher. <br/><br/>&quot;So a family that comes in that is already on the state waitlist is able to get a voucher right away so they don&#39;t have to wait and they are able to get a job and start on their job right away,&quot; said Maria Gonzalez Moeller, CEO of The Community Group. &quot;Once that family qualifies for a state voucher, then we transition that family so it acts as a bridge between now and when they finally come up on the state waitlist for childcare subsidy.&quot;<br/><br/>The Lawrence scholarship also simplified the documentation requirements to make it easier for families to apply for the help.<br/><br/>The scholarship program has placed 289 Lawrence children in daycares around the city. Gonzalez Moeller and other advocates for childcare say the Lawrence program is a model that could expand access to early childhood programs across Massachusetts.<br/><br/>&quot;The results that we&#39;ve gotten from this program show that there is something not working with the current program at the state level, and that there are adjustments that we can make to increase access at the state level,&quot; she said.",Craig LeMoult,Thu Feb 10 09:50:05 EST 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Article,A piece of Franklin's history is going up for sale. Asking price: $1,A piece of Franklin's history is going up for sale. Asking price: $1,"You could soon buy a historic 19th century building in the town of Franklin for as little as $1.<br/><br/>The South Franklin Congregational Meeting House is a small white church built in 1856, with imposing Doric columns outside and detailed plaster work inside. In 1972, the town took ownership and turned it into a history museum, but it has sat vacant since 2007. <br/><br/>In 2020, the town hired LLB Architects to study the building and see how much it would actually cost to preserve the building and bring it up to code. The estimate was about $2 million.<br/><br/>That steep price tag is why the town plans to open an invitation for bids on March 2. They&#39;re hoping to sell the meeting house to a buyer who is willing to preserve the historic exterior for the life of the building, said Franklin Town Administrator Jamie Hellen. He&#39;s hopeful that asking for a nominal selling price could save it from being knocked down.<br/><br/>&quot;Typically, when you have a property like this, it&#39;s going to be financially difficult for any builder, developer or preservationist to come in and pay a high price for the property or the building, right?&quot; Hellen explained. &quot;They&#39;re already going to be investing a lot of money into the restoration of the building.&quot;<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1644622150662,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1644622150662,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-e5c0-df7c-af7f-e7c58c9d0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-160b-d269-a3fd-be3b431a0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-bb2a-d663-a3fa-bf7b722a0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-eb1d-d2da-a97e-ef3d61370008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-eb1d-d2da-a97e-ef3d606a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>He said the structure is well built, with the beams, walls and roof all in excellent shape.<br/><br/>But, he added, it looks kind of like a haunted house these days.

She has also seen the impact of incarceration on her community. <br/><br/>“Over the last three years, there’s been a decrease in women incarcerated, which shows that we can really be a model and an example to what different looks like,” James said. “The prison and jail moratorium bill is just kind of us planting the seed to say that we don’t need — not just a women’s prison — but we don’t need any more prisons and jails, period, in Massachusetts.” <br/><br/>Instead, James said, the state should invest the millions of dollars it would use to build jails and prisons in communities that are over-incarcerated and under-resourced. <br/><br/>Chase Struss, who grew up in Brockton and now resides in North Attleboro, has been canvassing in support of the bill. He also said he has seen the negative impacts of incarceration.<br/><br/>“Prisons don’t help communities; they damage them incredibly,” Struss said.

Article,"With election workers harder to find, city and town clerks look to boost pay","With election workers harder to find, city and town clerks look to boost pay","Election workers’ long days and low pay — often below minimum wage — are making it difficult for municipal clerks to find people willing to take the jobs in the pandemic. Ahead of spring town elections and the state primaries in the fall, some hope to draw in more workers by increasing their stipends. <br/><br/>Though the pay and hours have long been tough, particularly with only being called on a few days out of the year for elections, recruitment problems were exacerbated in the pandemic for those who might worry about being indoors with voters all day. <br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1644964666283,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1644964666283,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-db41-d578-a77e-db714f9c0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-30dd-d4b5-a5ff-fbff7f900003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017b-ef1e-d00c-ab7f-efffb7e90003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-ff88-dc40-af7f-ff8c16c90002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-ff88-dc40-af7f-ff8c16850000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>“I think they deserve a raise because they show up at 6 o’clock in the morning, they go home at 9 o’clock at night, you know, that’s a long day,” said Beverly City Clerk Lisa Kent. “The busy elections, you don’t have time to sit down or know your name. ... They’re just good workers and they really deserved it a long time ago.”<br/><br/>Many election workers are retirees, which has put an extra strain on local elections during the pandemic because they are older and more vulnerable to infection, making some of them more reluctant to work the polls in the pandemic, said Geoff Beckwith, executive director of the Massachusetts Municipal Association. <br/><br/>“Communities need to stand up very complex operations,” Beckwith said, “usually hiring scores and scores of one-day volunteers. The reason why I call them volunteers is the pay generally has been extremely low. And almost all are retired and are doing this as an extension of their community service, really.”<br/><br/>Lydia Weston has been working elections in Beverly for the last five years. Weston, who is 78, said the city has taken great care with COVID-19 precautions, which has kept her comfortable at polling places, although she knows other older workers who stopped coming.<br/><br/>“I would love for some younger people to step up,” Weston said, “because we can’t do it all by ourselves. In fact, we had to have somebody from another city come in at one point.”<br/><br/>Beckwith said one response to recruiting more elections workers is to raise stipends.<br/><br/>“But that, of course, is something that&#39;s not built into municipal budgets,” Beckwith said. “And so we’re really hoping that the state will recognize that and provide assistance to cities and towns so they can have the poll workers that we need in order to run the elections in the most effective and efficient way possible.”<br/><br/>In Beverly, Kent is proposing to nearly double the city’s current stipend rates of $125 to $150 a day, depending on duties. With a working day that can stretch from 14 to 16 hours, that rate can result in as little as $8 an hour. Kent’s new budget would raise the daily rates to $235 to $270 a day.<br/><br/>Weston said that would make a significant difference to her, since she says she&#39;s concerned about how effectively her social security payments can keep up with her expenses.<br/><br/>“That will help with the grocery bill, for example,” Weston said. “And in my personal life, I have three dogs ... and I&#39;m going to the vet every five minutes, so it will really help with that.”<br/><br/>Beckwith said many communities still pay relatively low stipends for election workers, yet are facing a need to recruit more people. And the rise of mail-in voting during the pandemic is making elections even more complicated to run, Beckwith said, because mail-in-voting doesn’t eliminate the need for brick-and-mortar polling places for those who still prefer to cast their ballots in person.<br/><br/>“So while in the long run, we may have fewer people showing up to vote,” said Beckwith, “it’s still a very important service to provide to ensure that we&#39;re a democratic society.”<br/>",Mark Herz,Tue Feb 15 19:10:50 EST 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,Labor committee chairs want to halt unemployment agency's collection of overpayments,Labor committee chairs want to halt unemployment agency's collection of overpayments,"The chairs of the state legislature’s labor committee are trying to halt the state Department of Unemployment Assistance from collecting on overpaid unemployment benefits.<br/><br/>DUA overpaid at least $2.7 billion on more than 719,000 unemployment claims in 2020 and 2021, according to an analysis of state filings with the U.S. Labor Department. That assessment was conducted by Rory MacAneney, an attorney with free legal aid provider Community Legal Aid.<br/><br/>Sen. Patricia Jehlen and Rep. John Cutler addressed a letter to Labor and Workforce Development Secretary Rosalin Acosta, asking that &quot;the Department of Unemployment Assistance pause collection for non-fault overpayments from residents until the end of July of 2022.”<br/><br/>The plea, sent Friday, said the pause would ensure legislators and “partners in Washington” have time to talk and see what went wrong, and find solutions to help the hundreds of thousands of residents impacted. <br/><br/>Jehlen said there’s a slew of reasons people could be flagged for overpayment, and she isn’t convinced all the people affected are fraudsters. <br/><br/>“People should not have to pay what little money they have for errors that were not their own fault,” she said. “We need a pause on collection so the department can catch up on the appeals that are pending, and we&#39;ll learn what the actual impact is.”<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1644965451712,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1644965451712,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-db39-d578-a77e-db7933410003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-9d36-d8d4-a5ff-dd37ee690003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-db2a-de5b-adfe-ffbbc6be0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-ff94-df7c-af7f-ffd54d470010&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017e-ff94-df7c-af7f-ffd54c560000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>In the letter, Jehlen and Cutler suggested the pause include a direct notice to people in overpayment status that explains their account balance remains unchanged, but they’re under no obligation to pay until August. They pointed to the student loan payment pause put in place by the federal Department of Education during the pandemic, and the notices of that policy posted within people&#39;s student loan account portals.<br/><br/>The DUA said in a statement that it has dropped or waived $1.8 billion in overpayments since March 2020. It’s unclear if that amount can be subtracted from the $2.7 billion. <br/><br/>The Legislature also recently enacted <a href=""https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/H4202"" target=""_blank"">a bill that requires the DUA to provide a detailed report of overpayment data by March 1</a>, which Jehlen said will provide some insight. The legislators also want to figure out if recently released <a href=""https://wdr.doleta.gov/directives/attach/UIPL/UIPL_20-21_Change_1.pdf"">federal guidance</a> can be used to request waivers for people who received the overpayments. <br/><br/>The DUA said it&#39;s reviewing that guidance so that it can &quot;take advantage of new opportunities to provide claimants relief, and will apply for additional federal relief if needed.&quot; The agency said the vast majority of apparent overpayments are the result of rule changes to the federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program. In particular, the department said a rule change in January 2021 related to proof of employment requirements accounts for approximately $1.1 billion in overpayments.<br/><br/>Diana, who doesn&#39;t want to use her last name, was a freelancer working in creative technology and lost gigs at the onset of COVID-19. She received pandemic unemployment assistance from March 2020 to July 2021. By September 2021, Diana found full-time work, and she stopped filing for benefits. When she was preparing her taxes in January, she signed into the unemployment portal, where she saw a notice about her eligibility for unemployment. <br/><br/>“It was very vague, the wording. It basically said that I may be eligible for unemployment in another state, or I might have applied for unemployment in another state. It was really anxiety-producing to get,” she said. She thought someone had stolen her identity and filed for unemployment in her name in another state. The amount the agency wanted back? Over $40,000. <br/><br/>She called an unemployment assistance hotline and wasn’t able to get any answers. Diana hired an attorney who recommended she reach out to her local legislator, Sen. Pat Jehlen. Jehlen’s office was able to get her in touch with the right staffers at DUA who explained the problem: an old job out-of-state had given her a financial award for a patent she applied for. The problem is, Diana claimed that award when she filed for weekly unemployment benefits, and even included it in a previous years’ taxes. So it was an agency error, and she owes nothing at all. <br/><br/>“Even when it was rectified with the DUA, I had this feeling of being grateful, but I was also feeling like, Oh my God, it took so much effort, even with me having education and being able to speak English clearly, I still didn&#39;t understand most of what they were telling me,” she said. <br/><br/>MacAneney said that the $2.7 billion figure she calculated included people like Diana, whose cases were remedied. The outstanding overpayments, which haven’t yet been reversed or waived by the DUA, numbers around $660 million. <br/><br/>In her work as an attorney, MacAneney said she’d seen a lot of people who were told they were overpaid. <br/><br/>“And sometimes that decision was right, that they were overpaid for some reason,&quot; she said. &quot;Sometimes the decision was not right, and we try to help people out with that.&quot; <br/><br/>She acknowledged that the DUA saw a massive amount of claims during the pandemic, but sometimes had to “cut corners” to help people get benefits in a timely fashion as they struggled to pay the bills. <br/><br/>In a January interview with GBH&#39;s <i>Boston Public Radio</i>, <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2022/01/27/baker-hears-frustrated-calls-over-scrutiny-of-states-unemployment-benefit"">Gov.

The law also requires petitioners to assert that they’ve exhausted other efforts before resorting to surveillance. <br/><br/>“These requests are not common and are our last resort,’’ he said.<br/><br/>It&#39;s unclear whether the bill will get enough support to get out of committee. Some lawmakers privately voiced skepticism, particularly because of the lack of support among civil liberties groups, lawmakers or people of color. <br/><br/>Prosecutors who support the legislature urged lawmakers to find consensus. If they don’t like the wording of the bill, they said, find ways to make it better. Others urged lawmakers to change nothing at all. Crockford testified that the government already has more tools to track and monitor suspects, including obtaining warrants to obtain GPS data and private text messages. <br/><br/>“Monitoring the content of personal communication is a tool that is best suited to identifying and disrupting serious criminal activity that is coordinated among multiple parties, which is exactly what the current statute enables,’’ she said. &quot;ACLU of Massachusetts respectfully asks the committee to recommend that this legislation not pass.” ",Jenifer B.

Article,Council approves commutations for William Allen and Thomas Koonce,Council approves commutations for William Allen and Thomas Koonce,"The eight-member Governor’s Council made history on Wednesday by approving Gov. Charlie Baker’s commutations for two men, giving them the chance for parole after decades behind bars.<br/><br/>The group voted unanimously, changing Thomas Koonce and William Allen’s first-degree sentences to second-degree, making them eligible for parole.<br/><br/>Allen, 48, has served 27 years in prison following a 1997 conviction for the murder of Purvis Bester, which Allen was present for but did not himself commit.<br/><br/>Allen&#39;s attorney, Patty DeJuneas, read a statement he emailed her yesterday to thank Baker and the Governor’s Council.<br/><br/>“I also want to thank everyone that believed I should have a second chance to try to amend the harm I caused our community,” wrote Allen. “You all have given hope to a lot of us throughout the department of corrections, because this door has opened once again, and everyone is working on themselves so they can be awarded the same opportunity as I’ve been given today.”<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1645036981113,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1645036981113,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-6d97-db0e-ab7f-6db73b480003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-9e0a-d208-a97c-df6b4bb90003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-03d3-d83b-a97f-77d36ec20013&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-03d3-d83b-a97f-77d36df00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>At <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2022/02/02/governors-council-hears-case-for-commuting-william-allens-life-sentence"" style=""box-sizing: border-box;min-height: 0px;min-width: 0px"">his Feb. 2 hearing before the Governor’s Council</a>, councilors referred to the night of the crimes, but said Allen&#39;s actions in the decades since swayed them toward voting in favor of his commutation. Supporters testified about how Allen volunteered for a companion program to help people with severe mental disabilities, and how he helped de-escalate potentially dangerous situations.<br/><br/>Allen spoke during the last hour and, unprompted, expressed his remorse before responding to councilors&#39; questions. “There is not a day that goes by that I do not think about my actions and the fact that Mr. Bester’s family had to bury their loved one,” he said, asking for a moment of silence for Bester. Members of Bester’s family had previously told the parole board they’d support a commutation of his sentence. <br/><br/>In 1994, Allen and Rolando Petty drove to Bester’s Brockton apartment with a plan to rob him. Allen held several women at knifepoint in one room and demanded money, while Perry stabbed Bester in another room, which Allen said he didn&#39;t know was going to happen. While Allen refused a plea deal, Perry pled guilty to second-degree murder, served time and was released on parole in 2011.<br/><br/>“We are just thrilled that it was unanimous. We promised the governor&#39;s council that William is going to make them proud,” said DeJuneas. “He&#39;ll make us proud and he&#39;s going to continue to do good works once he&#39;s released.”<br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1645038023591,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1645038023591,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017f-03bf-d6af-a77f-5bbfe37f0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;Thomas Koonce, seated next to attorney Tim Foley (right) waits to testify before the Governor&amp;#39;s Council on Jan. 26, 2022&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-03e7-d19f-a3ff-eff7e0480000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-03e7-d19f-a3ff-eff7e0280000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">thomas koonce</bsp-image><br/>Koonce, 54, was convicted in 1992 for the death of Mark Santos of New Bedford as a result of an altercation in 1987, with no chance of parole.<br/><br/>Koonce went to a nightclub in Westport with three other men while home from his time on the U.S. Marine Corps in July 1987. A fight broke out between his group and another from New Bedford, so his group left.<br/><br/>Later in the evening, the two groups came to a head outside of a party. In the middle of the confrontation, Koonce pulled out a .22-caliber pistol, and fired out a passenger window. The shot hit Santos and killed him. Koonce maintains that he meant to shoot the gun over the crowd instead of into it.<br/><br/>Koonce was incarcerated in 1987 and 1988 before posting bail, and went back to the Marine Corps, but was incarcerated again in 1992 after a second trial. The first in 1991 ended in a hung jury.<br/><br/>At his January commutation hearing before the council, Koonce said he takes full responsibility for the shooting. He told the board, “I’m not the same 20-year-old that pulled the trigger and made some very bad decisions that night.”<br/><br/>Bristol County District Attorney Thomas Quinn, who has led the office since 2015, told the council in January that the commutation would be “a just and appropriate result.”<br/><br/>The Santos family wrote a letter to Baker asking for Koonce to remain incarcerated for life. <br/><br/>On Wednesday, Tim Foley, an attorney for Koonce, said his client is grateful to the council and is keeping the Santos family in mind.<br/><br/>“I know that Mr. Koonce is eligible for parole. And [he is] always keeping in mind the victim’s family, the Santos family, and our prayers go out to them on a day that&#39;s probably difficult for them. But Mr. Koonce hopes to prove to them that he is worthy of this decision today,” Foley said in call.<br/><br/>The approvals of Baker&#39;s commutations are the first by the Council since 2014, when Deanne Hamilton’s drug-related sentence was commuted, and the first murder-related sentence in 25 years.<br/><br/>The men must now go before the parole board, whose members also serve on the Advisory Board of Pardons, which approved their commutation pleas back in the fall. It is likely they will be released before July 1.<br/><br/>DeJuneas said Baker’s counsel office told her the parole board will expedite the process and reconvene in March.

The receiver became the home’s new owner and sold it a year later for nearly $80,000. <br/><br/>Gedeon, meanwhile, died in January in a rental home a few miles away after arguing for years, unsuccessfully, that the government had stolen his family home.<br/><br/>That’s not the intended consequence of a state process called &quot;receivership&quot; created to combat blight. But Gedeon’s story has prompted growing concern in Springfield that the court-ordered initiative is pushing out low-income homeowners while private companies are cashing in. <br/><br/><b>“</b>These are people&#39;s homes and their whole lives are being destroyed as a result of this policy,” said Vanessa Rosa, a professor of Latinx studies at Mount Holyoke College who has studied the process. “People should know what&#39;s happening, because it’s not right.”<br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1646357105984,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-e669-d0a5-a176-fe6fb81c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1646357105984,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-e669-d0a5-a176-fe6fb81c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017f-5285-d6af-a77f-5aa583840001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-5285-d83b-a97f-77d577410000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:&quot;/enhancement/EnhancementRight.hbs&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-5285-d83b-a97f-77d5771c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">Michael Gedeon at an event of Springfield No One Leaves.</bsp-image><br/><br/>Alerted by concerns from housing advocates, a group of Rosa’s students investigated the process a few years ago. They found more than 51 percent of properties that went into receivership between 2008 and 2017 in Springfield ended up being purchased by the businesses appointed to bring them back to code. And receivers were not shy about how profits were drawing them into the business, research showed. <br/><br/>For instance, the co-owners of a company called YellowBrick Property LLC <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTRGbzKMZkY&amp;t=24s"" target=""_blank"">posted a YouTube video last year</a> titled, “FREE HOUSE,” saying they’ve been involved with more than 50 receiverships and obtained more than 100 rental properties through the court-ordered process.<b> </b>Most of these homes were in Springfield, they say, making them the busiest receiver in the city. <br/><br/>In the video, one of the YellowBrick principals, Matthew Tortoriello, boasted he could help other companies make similar gains through the program. “Receiverships are a fantastic way for you to acquire property for zero acquisition costs, not to mention help your cities and towns clean up blighted properties,” said Tortoriello. “See all the ways to do it so you can do it too.”<br/><br/>Springfield City Councilor Jesse Lederman told GBH News in February that he is going to request an official investigation into how the city uses the process. Lederman said he was motivated to seek more information after hearing from housing activists about concerns of abuse and watching the YellowBrick YouTube video.<br/><br/>“Anytime you have the government involved in seizing property, especially seizing property and moving towards eventual profit for somebody, there has to be extreme oversight,’’ he said. “We have to make sure that it is clear, it is transparent, it is fair.”<br/><br/>The receivership process was <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21217060-receivership-legislation2"" target=""_blank"">created in the 1990s in Massachusetts</a> and used sporadically until 2008 when cities and towns began searching for ways to clean up vacant and abandoned properties — the brick-and-mortar orphans of the country’s foreclosure crisis. At that time, the state Office of the Attorney General created the<a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21182255-ahi-030119-1"" style=""text-decoration:none;""> <u>Abandoned Housing Initiative</u></a><u> </u>to hire receivers to fix up properties when homeowners and banks were unable or unwilling to do the work. Versions of receiverships are <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21272094-ssrn-id3110391#document/p13/a2083503"" target=""_blank"">used in about 20 states</a> across the country.<br/><br/>The Office of the Attorney General says it has worked with more than 150 municipalities through the legal process, helping to repair about 320 properties across the state. Attorney General Maura Healey said in a written statement that “receivership can be a necessary tool to return properties to a safe and habitable status.” But, she said, “it should only be used as a last resort with appropriate checks and balances in place to avoid overuse and gentrification.”<br/><br/>The YellowBrick video has prompted consternation from some government officials and housing activists who say the program shouldn’t be seen as a profit magnet. The sheer number of receiverships undertaken by one company raised eyebrows. A spokesman for the Attorney General’s Office said its office works, “with a multitude of receivers across the state and has never had a receiver appointed to 50 properties (nor would we).”<br/><br/>Springfield officials say they do all they can to work with homeowners before they appoint a receiver. But Lisa deSousa, a deputy city solicitor in the Springfield Law Department, is not surprised a majority of homes end up in the hands of the businesses that fixed them up — and says it might even be an undercount. She says it’s an unintended outcome of the city’s reliance on receivership to clean up blighted homes with limited public money.<br/><br/><b>“</b>We&#39;ve got to enforce the codes because there&#39;s health and safety issues and the city can&#39;t afford to do that,” she said. “We&#39;re one of the poorest cities in Massachusetts and there&#39;s a finite amount of money and this was a way to get money and properties fixed up.’’<br/><br/>YellowBrick principals Kevin Shippee and Tortoriello say they are doing well by doing good. They told GBH News that most of the homes they’ve worked on were unoccupied. If they did have people in them, they said, they tried to work with residents to help them maintain their homes. Shippee says the process is good for everybody.<br/><br/>“The neighbors and neighborhood get a property back on track, if it&#39;s a rental property, the tenants get a property that&#39;s brought back to code, and the receivers aren&#39;t and should not work for free,’’ he said. “Profit isn&#39;t a dirty word.”<br/><br/>Another YellowBrick principal, Theodore Agranat, told GBH News that the YouTube posting advertising the receivership program was a marketing ploy that went too far. “No one can ever get a &#39;free house,&#39;&quot; he wrote in a message from his home in Puerto Rico. “I personally prefer to use a different approach to marketing.”<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1646576987278,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-fe91-d9b7-abe6-feb1834f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1646576987278,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-fe91-d9b7-abe6-feb1834f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-2672-ddaa-a77e-6f76028d0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000016d-20c1-d773-abff-e2e9d98e0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000168-75be-da5a-a7ec-f7fe3d4e0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a66000a&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-5fa1-d83b-a97f-7ff16994000c&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-5fa1-d83b-a97f-7ff166b60000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>There’s likely no municipality in Massachusetts that has more aggressively embraced the use of receiverships than Springfield, a gateway city hard-hit by the state’s foreclosure crisis.<br/><br/>It’s one of two large cities, including Boston, to run receiverships independently through their own legal departments — allowing more freedom to use the process to fix up homes with people still living in them. With <a href=""https://www.massachusetts-demographics.com/cities_by_population"" target=""_blank"">a population</a> less than a quarter the size of Boston’s, Springfield has completed some 300 receiverships since 2008, more than three times the number of receiverships initiated in Boston since the late 1990s, data and interviews show. <br/><br/>Springfield officials say <a href=""https://www.scribd.com/document/281858624/Receivership-Tour-Press-Release-9-18-2015"" target=""_blank"">legal actions have been necessary</a> to help clean up problem properties in a city that has been plagued by boarded-up buildings, arson and vandalism made worse by the great recession. DeSousa, the deputy city solicitor, acknowledges the receivership system had had some problems. There have been occasional “bad” receivers who inflated costs or didn’t do the work, she says. But they are the “exceptions.” <br/><br/>There also were concerns that some receivers — particularly YellowBrick — were getting more properties than others. But she says the city has worked to make the process more equitable. At the same time the need for receivers has gone down as the housing market has improved and more homeowners see the benefits of holding onto their properties. Most importantly, deSousa maintains, most people losing their homes through the process have been given every chance to save them. If occupied, she said, residents were often tenants living in unsafe conditions who needed help.<br/><br/>“Some of the properties we saw just almost defied description,” she said. <br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1646356789929,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-e669-d0a5-a176-fe6fb81c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1646356789929,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-e669-d0a5-a176-fe6fb81c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017f-5281-d6af-a77f-5aa5cf950001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-5281-d837-a97f-5ae3bc4b0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-5281-d837-a97f-5ae3bc220000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">Outside of court building</bsp-image><br/>The city doesn’t have a specific set of criteria that would send a house into receivership. Instead, deSousa describes the program as a last resort after the city runs out of tools to get a property owner to fix code violations. A receiver is appointed following concerns that a property is violating the<a href=""https://www.mass.gov/doc/105-cmr-410-state-sanitary-code-chapter-ii-minimum-standards-of-fitness-for-human-habitation/download"" style=""text-decoration:none;""> <u>State Sanitary Code</u></a> by failing to meet what are described as “minimum standards of Fitness for Human Habitation.”<br/><br/>“We are, by and large, complaint driven,” she said. “Either a tenant has called us, a neighbor has called us, sometimes the police will call us.”<br/><br/>Court records show the city spent about four years trying to get Gedeon to fix up his family home, which officials described as an “illegal junkyard,” strewn with unregistered motor vehicles, scrap metal and trash. <br/><br/>Frustrated by lack of compliance, the city in 2012 entered the property to clean it — and found a half dozen 275-gallon oil tanks they worried were a fire hazard. That’s when the city asked a judge to appoint a receiver.<br/><br/>City officials say in court records that the house was vacant but Gedeon’s family says he was living there, frustrated about how the government could tell him what to do with his own home. He was a construction worker and “master welder” by trade, they said, and liked to tinker with cars.<br/><br/>Gedeon’s niece, Phylis Gedeon, says her uncle felt he was living the American dream and should have the freedom to do what he wanted at his home. He believed, “The government can’t come in and say, ‘Well, this is what you do with your corner of the world,’’’ she said. “He was always a fighter.”<br/><br/>If the home needed work, she said, city officials should have done more to help him. “I think the city needs to look at being supportive of homeowners, especially homeowners of color.”<br/><br/>Rose Webster-Smith, executive director of the nonprofit housing group, Springfield No One Leaves, believes the city exaggerated dangers at Gedeon’s home and then went overboard to intervene. <br/><br/>&quot;They went in there with the police department, armed and everything else for a single man in his residence,’’ she said. <br/><br/>A fierce housing advocate who saved her own home from foreclosure, Webster-Smith said she had first supported the receivership initiative to help clean up homes abandoned by investors or banks. As she learned more, she worried low-income homeowners with minimal code violations were arbitrarily being appointed receivers who were then doing more work than needed to inflate costs. <br/><br/>That’s when she reached out to researchers at Mount Holyoke College. They determined the city appointed a disproportionate number of receivers in lower income areas with a higher percentage of people of color even when higher income neighborhoods also had abandoned homes. A GBH News analysis of their data showed at least 23% of homes that entered the receivership program were occupied. <br/><br/>“We don&#39;t have a problem when the receivership program is focused on vacant abandoned property,’’ Webster-Smith said. “We have the problem when people are living there and you&#39;re displacing people.”<br/><br/>Losing her family home is what Marjorie Perry has been worrying about ever since her home went into receivership last year. Perry told GBH News she feels the city is trying to steal the family home her immigrant father purchased decades ago. “It’s a scam to defraud people of their homes,’’ she said. <br/><br/>Perry’s home ended in receivership after she moved to Florida several years ago to take care of her ailing father. She said she failed to respond to city notices about code violations, including “crumbling front steps, rotted roof shingles and a garage with cracked paneling,” court records show. <br/><br/>But Perry said she never got a fine and figured if she was paying her taxes she was OK.<br/><br/>Now Perry is grateful a neighbor called to let her know a company was working on her house so she could respond before the improvement costs became too high for her to handle. Already, she is questioning the repair bill, which has grown to nearly $7,000. “I just couldn&#39;t kind of comprehend that having a code violation would warrant something like this happening,” she said. <br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1646585031427,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000171-a799-dbef-a3ff-a79be2470000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1646585031427,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000171-a799-dbef-a3ff-a79be2470000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017f-527a-d19f-a3ff-ff7f7ce80001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;Marjorie Perry’s home in Springfield, Mass. went into receivership last year. &quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-527a-d6af-a77f-5a7e70dd0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-527a-d6af-a77f-5a7e70c30000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">2022Springfield-3.jpg</bsp-image><br/><br/>Gedeon spent years fighting for his homes. First the city appointed a receiver for his residence and then a few months later for a two-family he owned nearby. Both properties were ultimately purchased by the receivers hired to fix them up. <br/><br/>The companies could not be reached for comment. But family members say Gedeon was a proud man who kept his housing struggles to himself. Among housing advocates, he was known as a fighter, biking through town with court records in his backpack, pouring through legal records, and filing lawsuits in state and federal court. He claimed the companies hired to fix up his properties inflated costs and failed to provide receipts. <br/><br/>Even after he’d lost his legal battles, Gedeon attended court hearings, advising others about how to protect their homes.<br/><br/>Armed with the Mount Holyoke College study, activists have pushed city officials to do more to help low-income homeowners. Among improvements, Lederman, the at-large city councilor, is proposing creation of a housing trust fund, which would use money from the federal American Rescue Plan Act to help homeowners rehabilitate blighted properties through grants.<br/><br/>“Our first and foremost goal should be to assist them in any way possible, help connect them with programs,’’ Lederman said, not, “trying to seize their property from them.”<br/><br/><i>Grace Ferguson, Mia Khatib and Luwa Yin were students in McKim’s investigative reporting class at Boston University.</i>","Jenifer B.

Article,GBH President Jon Abbott plans to step down,GBH President Jon Abbott plans to step down,"<i>Updated 5:45 p.m. Feb. 23</i><br/><br/>Jon Abbott, president and CEO of GBH, says he will step down by the end of the year after 15 years leading the nation’s largest public broadcaster.<br/><br/>Abbott, who joined GBH in 1998 and became president and CEO in 2007, made the announcement on Wednesday. The 59-year-old plans to stay on through the end of 2022. The organization will soon begin its search for his successor. <br/><br/>Under Abbott, GBH’s endowment <a href=""https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2017/04/13/wgbh-wlvi-reap-huge-windfall-sale-broadcast-spectrum/Dup2N9TEWT63kQbAJjVxwI/story.html"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>grew</u></a> from over $60 million to <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/foundation/celebrate-the-campaign"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>more</u></a> than $520 million. He oversaw the transformation of GBH from a broadcaster of radio and television to a multi-platform digital content creator, and efforts to expand the organization’s diversity in its programming and among its staff.<br/><br/>“We’ve moved to a multimedia, multi-platform environment from broadcasting. We’ve launched 10 [digital] services. We have remarkably talented people across the organization,” Abbott said, “and I feel really, extraordinarily proud and satisfied with where we are. And it feels like a natural time for me to close that chapter and imagine what a new chapter could look like.” <br/><br/>Lee Pelton, president and CEO of the Boston Foundation, and who serves on the GBH Board, said Abbott had helped make GBH “the gold standard by which all public media measure themselves.” He said Abbott’s most significant achievement was shifting from traditional broadcast to digital media.<br/><br/>“There are people who see the future and run from it. And there are people who see the future and run towards it. And he&#39;s one of the kind of leaders who runs towards the future,” Pelton said. <b> </b><br/><h3>His journey began with jazz and college radio</h3><br/>Abbott’s path to public media began with college radio. He grew up in New York City listening to jazz with his father at home and going to jazz clubs. When he became a student at Columbia University in 1980, the school’s noncommercial radio station WKCR played mostly jazz. Early on, Abbott got his own show. He said while broadcasting live shows with famed musicians at New York’s Blue Note Jazz Club, he was struck by the connection between an audience and the artists, and he understood the value of public media. <br/><br/>“Everybody wants to do a show but nobody wants to make sure the transmitter is working or the money’s being raised to make sure it can all happen,” Abbott said, “So I think I came to understand that I could be around all of that and make a difference by creating an environment, a supporting environment for other creative people.” <br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1645633924807,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1645633924807,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000170-e881-dfbf-abfb-f8bfc79e0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017b-0dba-dcfa-ab7f-cdfab8e30003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000016b-8661-db5e-a7ef-e7e50c300001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-276c-d837-a97f-7fee0ee20001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-276c-d837-a97f-7fee0e060000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>During Abbott’s tenure, GBH — which produces signature national programs including “Masterpiece,” “FRONTLINE,” “NOVA” and “Antiques Roadshow” — <a href=""https://www.wbur.org/news/2022/02/02/new-england-public-media-springfield-matt-abramovitz"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>expanded its local news coverage</u></a>, added podcasts and exclusive online content, and created digital platforms like “World Channel” for documentaries and “Create” for lifestyle content. GBH also grew its roster of kids programming to include “Molly of Denali,” the first national series to feature Native American and Alaska Native lead characters. According to GBH’s most recent data, GBH reaches more than 32 million people nationwide every week, across all its brands and platforms.<br/><br/>Abbott said he’s particularly proud of helping launch <a href=""https://mass.pbslearningmedia.org/"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>PBS LearningMedia</u></a>, a free online service built in partnership with PBS that offers digital resources for teachers and students. It now has nearly 20 million users nationwide. Abbott said the service saw a jump in audience during the pandemic when many students shifted from in-person to remote learning. <br/><h3>Diversity and work that’s “never done” </h3><br/>On Abbott’s watch, GBH committed to greater diversity both inside the organization and outside, by drawing in more diverse storytellers, an effort that picked up pace after George Floyd’s murder in May 2020.<br/><br/>In the wake of the national outcry and Black Lives Matter protests, many organizations found themselves reflecting on their own racial inequities, including GBH.In July, the organization, which has a public-interest mission to enrich lives “through the power of diverse perspectives,” <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2021/08/03/theres-work-to-do-diversity-data-shows-gbh-has-an-80-white-workforce"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>released data showing 80% of its workforce was white</u></a>. Since that time, Abbott brought on GBH’s first chief inclusion and equity officer and drove efforts to diversify staff and expand recruiting efforts.<br/><br/>Abbott said the work toward inclusivity is “never done,” and said his successor will need to continue diversifying GBH’s pool of creators to make it clear that GBH “attracts people of all backgrounds, races and economic means … to know they have a place at the table and to feel supported in contributing to public media.”<br/><br/>“I think if we can be an organization that’s seen as committed, energetic and inviting, I think we’ll continue to make progress,” Abbott said.  <br/><br/>Alberto Ibarguen, president and CEO of the Knight Foundation, and a former board chair of PBS said given the many skills required, finding Abbott’s successor will be “tough” but the choice is important.<br/><br/>“As the former chair of PBS&#39; board, I can tell you that there are a handful of stations, a small handful of stations in the in the category of WGBH in the entire nation. This is the leadership of public broadcasting in America, and whoever leads that organization matters,” said Ibarguen.<br/><br/>A national search will be conducted to replace Abbott. As for his own plans? <br/><br/>“I don&#39;t have an idea what the next chapter is. In some ways, I&#39;m not bothered at all by that,” said Abbott. “There&#39;s a joy in being able to think about a clean canvas.”<br/><br/><i>Editor&#39;s note: This article was written and edited by the GBH News staff, with no editorial oversight from GBH executives.</i><br/><br/><i>This story was updated to include additional quotes.</i>",Liz Neisloss,Wed Feb 23 11:45:16 EST 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The conflict was already shaking global financial markets: Stocks plunged and oil prices soared amid concerns that heating bills and food prices would skyrocket.<br/><br/>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy cut diplomatic ties with Moscow and declared martial law.<br/><br/>“As of today, our countries are on different sides of world history,&quot; Zelenskyy tweeted. &quot;Russia has embarked on a path of evil, but Ukraine is defending itself and won’t give up its freedom.”<br/><br/>His adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said: “A full-scale war in Europe has begun. ...

The autocratic Putin made clear earlier this week that he sees no reason for Ukraine to exist, raising fears of possible broader conflict in the vast space that the Soviet Union once ruled. Putin denied plans to occupy Ukraine, but his ultimate goals remain hazy.<br/><br/>Ukrainians who had long braced for the prospect of an assault were urged to stay home and not to panic despite the dire warnings.<br/><br/>With social media amplifying a torrent of military claims and counter-claims, it was difficult to determine exactly what was happening on the ground.<br/><br/>Associated Press reporters saw or confirmed explosions in the capital, in Mariupol on the Azov Sea, and Kharkiv in the east.

He accused the U.S. and its allies of ignoring Russia’s demands to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and for security guarantees.<br/><br/>The attacks came first from the air. Later Ukrainian authorities described ground invasions in multiple regions, and border guards released security camera footage Thursday showing a line of Russian military vehicles crossing into Ukraine’s government-held territory from Russian-annexed Crimea.<br/><br/>The Russian military claimed to have wiped out Ukraine’s entire air defenses in a matter of hours, and European authorities declared the country&#39;s air space an active conflict zone. Russia&#39;s claims could not immediately be verified, nor could Ukrainian ones that they had shot down several Russian aircraft. The Ukrainian air defense system and air force date back to the Soviet era and are dwarfed by Russia’s massive air power and precision weapons.<br/><br/>U.S. President Joe Biden pledged new sanctions to punish Russia for the “unprovoked and unjustified attack.” The president said he planned to speak to Americans on Thursday after a meeting of the Group of Seven leaders. More sanctions against Russia were expected to be announced.<br/><br/>Zelenskyy urged global leaders to provide defense assistance to Ukraine and help protect its airspace, and urged his compatriots to defend the nation.

Market benchmarks tumbled in Europe and Asia and U.S. stocks pointed toward a sharply lower open. Brent crude oil jumped to over $100 per barrel Thursday on unease about possible disruption of Russian supplies. The ruble sank.<br/><br/>Anticipating international condemnation and countermeasures, Putin issued a stark warning to other countries not to meddle.<br/><br/>In a reminder of Russia’s nuclear power, Putin warned that “no one should have any doubts that a direct attack on our country will lead to the destruction and horrible consequences for any potential aggressor.”<br/><br/>Among Putin’s pledges was to “denazify” Ukraine. World War II looms large in Russia, after the Soviet Union suffered more deaths than any country while fighting Adolf Hitler’s forces. Kremlin propaganda sometimes paints Ukrainian nationalists as neo-Nazis seeking revenge — a charge historians call disinformation. Ukraine is now led by a Jewish president who lost relatives in the Holocaust.<br/><br/>Putin’s announcement came just hours after the Ukrainian president rejected Moscow’s claims that his country poses a threat to Russia and made a passionate, last-minute plea for peace.<br/><br/>“The people of Ukraine and the government of Ukraine want peace,” Zelenskyy said in an emotional overnight address, speaking in Russian in a direct appeal to Russian citizens.<br/><br/>Zelenskyy said he asked to arrange a call with Putin late Wednesday, but the Kremlin did not respond.<br/><br/>The attack began even as the U.N. Security Council was meeting to hold off an invasion.

She would replace liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, 83, who is retiring at the end of the term this summer, so she won&#39;t change the court&#39;s 6-3 conservative majority.<br/><br/>Jackson would join the court as it weighs cutbacks to abortion rights and will be considering ending affirmative action in college admissions and restricting voting rights efforts to increase minority representation.<br/><br/>She would be only the sixth woman to serve on the court, but she would join three others already there, including the first Latina, Justice Sonia Sotomayor.<br/><br/>In brief remarks, Jackson thanked Biden, saying she was “humbled by the extraordinary honor of this nomination.&quot; She highlighted her family&#39;s first-hand experience with the entirety of the legal system, as judges and lawyers, an uncle who was Miami&#39;s police chief and another who was imprisoned on drug charges.<br/><br/>She also spoke of the historic nature of her nomination, noting she shared a birthday with Constance Baker Motley, the first Black woman to be confirmed to the federal bench.<br/><br/>“If I’m fortunate enough to be confirmed as the next associate justice of the Supreme Court United States, I can only hope that my life and career, my love of this country and the Constitution, and my commitment to upholding the rule of law and the sacred principles upon which this great nation was founded, will inspire future generations of Americans,” she said.<br/><br/>Jackson, 51, has spent a lot of time in Massachusetts. She attended Harvard as an undergraduate and for law school. She also clerked for federal judges in the commonwealth, and went on to clerk for the Supreme Court justice she&#39;s been nominated to succeed, Cambridge native Stephen Breyer.<br/><br/>Rebecca Tushnet, a professor of law at Harvard Law School, knows Jackson from when they both served as clerks at the Supreme Court. She said one aspect of Jackson&#39;s background that stands out is her public defender work.<br/><br/>&quot;Thurgood Marshall was the last justice, I believe, who had public defender experience,&quot; she said. &quot;And so that&#39;s really important in seeing the criminal justice system kind of at every level — from what it&#39;s like for the individual being charged with a crime, all the way up to important constitutional questions about what the police can and can&#39;t do, what prosecutors can and can&#39;t do. And she&#39;s just seen all parts of that system.&quot;<br/><br/>Though Tushnet believes her former colleague would be a &quot;fantastic&quot; justice, she recognizes that if Jackson is confirmed, she will have a tough job given the current configuration of the court.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#39;s very hard to imagine her making a difference on a bunch of outcomes,&quot; she said. &quot;I think she is incredibly collegial and able to work with people who have very different views, but that is probably not going to make a big difference in how the court actually operates, given that there is this conservative super majority that&#39;s clearly interested in making some big moves.&quot;<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1645828483132,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1645828483132,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-de0e-d578-a77e-de7fc8d50001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-7758-d9b9-a7fd-ff5ea6480003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-978b-d8b0-adfe-9ffbe1cb0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-3304-d83b-a97f-775452f10012&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-3304-d83b-a97f-775452170000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>Jackson served on the U.S. Sentencing Commission, the agency that develops federal sentencing policy, before becoming a federal judge in 2013. <br/><br/>Her nomination is subject to confirmation by the Senate, where Democrats hold the majority by a razor-thin 50-50 margin with Vice President Kamala Harris as the tie-breaker.

He bent to pull out a lectern step for her to stand on as she made her remarks.<br/><br/>Her introduction came two years to the day after Biden, then struggling to capture the Democratic presidential nomination, <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/ap-top-news-elections-sc-state-wire-south-carolina-joe-biden-2446d3f704da071fba44b4444214a2ea"">pledged in a South Carolina debate</a> to nominate a Black woman if presented with a vacancy.<br/><br/>Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin said in a statement that the panel will “begin immediately” to move forward on consideration of an “extraordinary nominee.” Senators have set a tentative goal of confirmation by April 8, when they leave for a two-week spring recess. Hearings could start as soon as mid-March.<br/><br/>That timeline could be complicated by a number of things, including <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-volodymyr-zelenskyy-boris-johnson-business-08f569df695831ee467979527ea2e241"">Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine</a> and the extended absence of Democratic Sen. <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/stephen-breyer-coronavirus-pandemic-joe-biden-us-supreme-court-health-618b25ed7ac76d07fa3a2a1c37b6f161"">Ben Ray Lujan</a> of New Mexico, who suffered a stroke last month and is out for several weeks.

After the committee approves a nomination, it goes to the Senate floor for a final vote.<br/><br/>Biden and Senate Democrats are hoping for a bipartisan vote on the nomination, but it’s unclear if they will be able to win over any GOP senators after bitterly partisan confirmation battles under President Donald Trump. South Carolina Sen. <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/stephen-breyer-joe-biden-us-supreme-court-donald-trump-lindsey-graham-96267a76b7673aa246899414f7199520"">Lindsey Graham</a>, one of three Republicans who voted to confirm Jackson to the appeals court last year, had pushed Biden to nominate a different candidate from his home state, Judge J. Michelle Childs, who also was favored by home-state Rep. James Clyburn, a Biden ally.<br/><br/>Graham said earlier this month his vote would be “very problematic” if it were anyone else, and he expressed disappointment in a tweet Friday. Previewing a likely Republican attack line, he and several others on the right said Biden was going with the choice of the “radical left.”<br/><br/>Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said he looked forward to meeting with Jackson and &quot;studying her record, legal views and judicial philosophy.” But he noted he had voted against her a year ago.<br/><br/>Biden has said he was interested in selecting a nominee in the mold of Breyer who could be a persuasive force with fellow justices. Although Breyer’s votes tended to put him to the left of center on an increasingly conservative court, he frequently saw the gray in situations that colleagues were more likely to find black or white.<br/><br/>“Justice Breyer — the members of the Senate will decide if I fill your seat,” Jackson said Friday, praising the retiring justice&#39;s “civility, grace, pragmatism and generosity of spirit.”<br/><br/>“But please know that I could never fill your shoes,” she said.<br/><br/>Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, “With her exceptional qualifications and record of evenhandedness, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson will be a justice who will uphold the Constitution and protect the rights of all Americans, including the voiceless and vulnerable.”<br/><br/>As part of his <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/biden-supreme-court-nominee-breyer-replacement-41912ca7a5919759cefb01cd82f7f97e"">search process</a>, Biden, a longtime chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, also interviewed Childs and California Supreme Court Judge Leondra Kruger, according to White House press secretary Jen Psaki, saying all three interviews took place on Feb. 14. As part of his process, Biden also consulted with a range of legal experts and lawmakers in both parties and delved deeply into the finalists&#39; legal writings.<br/><br/>Biden called Jackson late Thursday to inform her that she was his choice, Psaki said, and he informed Democratic congressional leaders Friday morning.<br/><br/>Jackson serves on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, a position that Biden elevated her to last year from her previous job as a federal trial court judge. Three current justices — Thomas, Brett Kavanaugh and John Roberts, the chief justice — previously served on the same appeals court.<br/><br/>Jackson was confirmed to that post on a 53-44 Senate vote, winning the backing of three Republicans: Graham, Maine’s Susan Collins and Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski.<br/><br/>In one of Jackson’s most high-profile decisions, as a trial court judge she ordered former White House Counsel Don McGahn to appear before Congress. That was a setback to Trump’s efforts to keep his top aides from testifying. The case was appealed, and a deal was ultimately reached for McGahn’s testimony.<br/><br/>As an appeals court judge, she was part of a three-judge panel that ruled in December against Trump’s effort to shield documents from the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.<br/><br/>Jackson was born in Washington, D.C., and grew up in Miami. She has said that her parents, Johnny and Ellery Brown, chose her name to express their pride in her family’s African ancestry. They asked an aunt who was in the Peace Corps in Africa at the time to send a list of African girls’ names and they picked Ketanji Onyika, which they were told meant “lovely one.”<br/><br/>Jackson traces her interest in the law to when she was in preschool and her father was in law school and they would sit together at the dining room table, she with coloring books and he with law books. Her father became an attorney for the county school board and her mother was a high school principal. A brother, nine years younger, served in the Army, including in Iraq, and is now a lawyer, too.<br/><br/><i>Associated Press writers Mark Sherman, Jessica Gresko and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.

Article,Justice Department ends controversial China Initiative,Justice Department ends controversial China Initiative,"The Department of Justice announced Wednesday that the China Initiative — a controversial program accused of profiling academics of Asian descent — is coming to an end.<br/><br/>The China Initiative was first billed as an anti-espionage program aimed at fighting the alleged specter of intellectual property theft by foreign researchers at top American universities. But recently, scholars, lawyers and one of the original architects of the China Initiative have raised concerns that the program had drifted from its mission and was discriminating against Chinese professors.<br/><br/>“DOJ should revamp, and shut down, parts of the program to avoid needlessly chilling scientific and business collaborations with Chinese partners,” former Massachusetts U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling wrote in a <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6872534688276258817/"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>Dec. 3 post on LinkedIn</u></a>. <br/><br/>A year earlier, Lelling had announced one of the most publicly contested arrests of the China Initiative: MIT mechanical engineering professor Gang Chen. Chen, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was taken into custody and charged with grant fraud just days before Lelling left his tenure. Lelling’s office alleged that Chen lied about connections to the Chinese government while applying for a research grant from the U.S. Department of Energy.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1645832179480,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1645832179480,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-7819-d1c4-a7fe-fa1bf0a60003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-930b-d1c4-a7fe-bb1bf3890003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-59fd-d177-adff-fffd2e8d0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-333c-d19f-a3ff-ff3de48d002d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-333c-d19f-a3ff-ff3de3ad0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>Last month, Lelling’s successor announced that her office was dismissing the case against Chen, citing a lack of proof that he had violated any laws.<br/><br/>“Today’s dismissal is a result of that process and is in the interests of justice,” Massachusetts U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/statement-us-attorney-rachael-s-rollins-dismissal-gang-chen-case"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>said in a statement.</u></a><br/><br/>Chen’s defense attorney, Robert Fisher, agrees that the Justice Department program has strayed from its original mission.<br/><br/>“[The China Initiative] morphed over the period of a couple of years into investigating professors who have grants with federal agencies,” Fisher said. <br/><br/>The program tasked prosecutors and federal agents around the country to crack down on intellectual property theft. But Fisher said the program overestimated the number of Chinese spies on American soil, so U.S. Attorneys like Lelling turned to a new target.<br/><br/>“You’re not going to find a spy from China in every district in the U.S.,” Fisher said. “The only cases they were finding, the only cases that existed, were these grant fraud error cases.”<br/><br/>The hunt for grant fraud cases might have been the China Initiative&#39;s own undoing. The arrest of a prominent MIT professor angered the MIT community, with over 200 of Chen’s colleagues writing an <a href=""https://twitter.com/zhigangsuo/status/1352584589445902336"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>open letter</u></a> to the university’s president against the arrest. The university later paid Chen’s legal bills. <br/><br/>“You had a large group of very well-respected people push back, including MIT,” Fisher said. “And I think that really sent a message to the DOJ and the FBI that wow, an internationally renowned institution is backing [Chen].”",Ava Sasani,Fri Feb 25 18:52:06 EST 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He confronted two people at a nearby party about the bottle and stabbed 15-year-old Troy Willis, who died. Mustafa was incarcerated from 1977 to 1992 for second-degree murder.<br/><br/>He spent his 15 years in prison learning computer programming, which he made into a career post-release. After getting out, Mustafa took classes at South End Technology Center and Roxbury Community College as a member of the Timothy Smith Network, a foundation that helps provide technology resources to Boston residents.<br/><br/>The organization hired him in 2010 as a technology trainer. He also spent time as manager of technology and facilities at the Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts.<br/><br/>Mustafa is currently an adjunct professor for Bunker Hill Community College. He is a parishioner of the Mosque of the Qur’an in Dorchester where he’s involved with community events and the Greater Boston Interfaith Organization.<br/><br/>But he also remains on parole and has to check in monthly. And the weight of being on parole is heavy. Mustafa said whenever he meets someone new, looks for a place to live, secures a loan, or seeks employment, it’s a discussion he has to lead with.<br/><br/>Mustafa has had no shortage of support for his petition to end his parole.<br/><br/>William Watkins, the director of workforce at the Urban League, wrote a letter of support saying, “Mr. Mustafa has become one of the leaders in computer technology that is widely respected by industry leaders alike. His expertise in this field has been a true benefit to this community before and during the pandemic.”<br/><br/>Parole officer Salvador Bolanos recommended Mustafa’s parole be terminated, saying, among other things, that he has a “beautifully maintained apartment and has much support from many in the community.”<br/><br/>Boston State Representative Liz Miranda also submitted a letter of support, saying “If anyone is deserving of your Board’s mercy, it is this man.”<br/><br/>Mustafa took responsibility for the death of Willis, and expressed remorse. “I believe in taking responsibility for my actions and striving to be better in the process,” he said in a letter to the Parole Board. “It is humbling to be judged by a crime committed forty-five years ago, as a teenager, when you are in your sixties.” <br/><br/>Nevertheless, the board rejected his petition in July 2021. The board said only that Mustafa didn’t establish &quot;a compelling reason why termination of parole supervision is in the public interest.”<br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1646357447694,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-e669-d0a5-a176-fe6fb81c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1646357447694,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-e669-d0a5-a176-fe6fb81c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017f-4bf0-d837-a97f-5bf2903c0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-528c-d6af-a77f-5aacd18e0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-528c-d6af-a77f-5aacd1750000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">Man standing on pathway in park.</bsp-image><br/><b>Challenging the denial</b><br/><br/>Attorneys Victoria Kelleher, Eric Tennen and James Pingeon filed a lawsuit in the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court on behalf of Mustafa and other former prisoners. <br/><br/>“We brought a lawsuit because parole basically had no real process in place for people to terminate their parole early, even though there&#39;s a statute that allows for it,” said Tennen. “And the statute&#39;s been on the books for a long time.”<br/><br/>That statute is a 1955 provision that says the parole board can issue a certificate of termination &quot;if it’s in the public interest&quot; after a person has spent a year on parole.<br/><br/>&quot;The<b> </b>Legislature thought that it would be good public policy to terminate parole when people no longer need supervision. And yet the board has decided that it is unwilling to implement that,” Pingeon said.<br/><br/>The lawsuit claims the Parole Board has effectively repealed state law by adopting a “blanket practice” of denying termination in virtually all cases. It’s typical for people who apply for termination to get a one or two sentence denial, he said, but there’s never any reason given why the parolee hasn’t demonstrated that it’s in the public’s interest to terminate. <br/><br/>The Parole Board has not responded to a GBH News request for the number of people whose parole has been terminated in the past decade.<br/><br/>But the Parole Board has offered a hodgepodge of responses to similar requests by attorneys in the past. In one case, the board said 51 petitions for termination were submitted between Sept. 2015 and Sept. 2018 but none were approved. In another case, the board’s attorney said that one termination was granted out of 19 requests between 2019 and 2021.<br/><br/>The plaintiffs want the court to order the Parole Board to create a formal process for terminating parole, approve more termination requests and provide a written reason for denials in a reasonable amount of time. <br/><br/>The parole board told GBH it can’t comment on active litigation, but it agreed in January to draft regulations on terminating parole and to invite public comments, according to court filings. <br/><br/>“They want to put the case on hold while they pass formal regulations, which is one of the things we were seeking with our lawsuit,” said Tennen. “That&#39;s an absolute step in the right direction. So we agreed to stay the case so they can go through this regulation.” He’s hoping the rulemaking process takes place within 90 days. <br/><br/>If the Parole Board doesn&#39;t implement changes on its own, the legislature could get involved. State Rep Andy Vargas was part of the Massachusetts Special Commission on Structural Racism in the Massachusetts Parole Process, which issued its final report in December. Vargas said the commission &quot;found merit&quot; in examining lengthy supervision periods, and he noted “termination is rare even for those without any violations for years.” Vargas said developing a better process will require collaboration between the parole board, the legislature, and the judiciary, because parole length is set by judges during sentencing. <br/><br/>As of 2020, there were 1,683 people on parole in Massachusetts.<br/><br/>Pingeon, who is litigation director at Prisoners’ Legal Services, said many people have contacted the advocacy organization over the years for help ending their parole, and it almost never happens. <br/><br/>“Psychologically, it kind of undermines the fact that they have actually become fully rehabilitated and have fully adjusted to society,” he said. “And yet on some level, they&#39;re being treated as if they are a threat when they aren&#39;t a threat.”<br/><br/>Mustafa tried to appeal the decision when he learned last fall that his termination of parole was denied. That’s when he was told there is no appeal process.<br/><br/>&quot;It just seemed baffling to me, being in America, right? No appeal process,&quot; he said. &quot;And then that&#39;s really how I got drawn into the advocacy part of it.&quot;",Sarah Betancourt,Thu Mar 03 13:56:56 EST 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since 2020, there has been a global shortage of semiconductor chips — found in everything from cell phones to cars — due to the pandemic, economic conflict with China and other supply chain issues.<br/><br/>President Joe Biden has been urging Congress to pass $52 billion in spending related to semiconductor manufacturing as part of the so-called Bipartisan Innovation Act. In his State of the Union address Tuesday night, Biden said the Act would “make record investments in emerging technologies and American manufacturing.” <br/><br/>Raimondo said during her visit that the United States used to manufacture nearly 40% of the world’s semiconductors, but now only makes around 12%. She praised MIT’s facilties and research related to semiconductors and related nanotechnology. <br/><br/>After the tour, she told GBH News that MIT is the “gold standard” for collaboration between academia and industry. <br/><br/>“That’s what we need to do — a real hands-on collaboration,” Raimondo said. “Ultimately, what we need is the great ideas and research that are beginning in universities to be turned into products made at scale in America.” <br/><br/>Jesús del Alamo, a professor of electrical engineering at MIT, published a white paper last year <a href=""https://usmicroelectronics.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/microelectronics_white_paper_v13.4.pdf"" target=""_blank"">calling on universities to take the lead in semiconductor and microtechnology research.</a> Some of his students — including first-year undergraduates — presented their work to Raimondo during her tour. <br/><br/>“This is really wonderful a time to be involved in nanotechnology, to be involved in microelectronics,” del Alamo said, “because you can really have innovations that would launch the next nanoelectronics revolution that will carry us 50 more years into the future.” <br/>",Jake Freudberg,Wed Mar 02 15:22:33 EST 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But <a href=""https://www.mass.gov/doc/task-force-fy22-annual-report/download"">the report</a>, by the state Multi-Agency Illegal Tobacco Task Force, says those products are being bought out of state and illegally sold in Massachusetts.<br/><br/>In 2021, state police and the Department of Revenue made 213,550 seizures of vape products, which the report refers to as “electronic nicotine delivery systems.”<br/><br/>&quot;The increase in seizures of flavored [vape] products and menthol cigarettes combined with the decrease in revenue for cigarettes and [other tobacco products] likely indicates increased cross-border smuggling of these products,&quot; the report says, noting that neighboring states, including New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont, reported an increase in tobacco revenue last year.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1646336017951,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-e4be-dadb-a77e-f5be3b2c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1646336017951,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-e4be-dadb-a77e-f5be3b2c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000016d-6392-d9e5-a96d-7fde0d210003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000179-1e24-ddcd-a57f-fffde4fc0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000016e-adbc-d3de-a5ff-bffda5ce0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-5144-d837-a97f-59e67a96002d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-5144-d837-a97f-59e6783c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>&quot;The Task Force now identifies the cross-border smuggling of untaxed flavored [vape] products, cigars, and menthol cigarettes as the primary challenge for tobacco enforcement in the Commonwealth,&quot; the report concludes. <br/><br/>The trade group representing many of the stores that sell tobacco products says it&#39;s not surprised by the report.<br/><br/>&quot;We knew this would happen because there was demand for these products,&quot; said Jonathan Shaer, executive director of the New England Convenience Store and Energy Marketers Association. Shaer&#39;s group lobbied against the law that banned menthol cigarettes and flavored vape products because of the loss of revenue for Massachusetts stores.<br/><br/>&quot;You&#39;ve got adults that have the ability to go and access these products legally in other states,&quot; he said. &quot;But what also we knew is that there was an existing illegal market for tobacco already... And when you vacate a market worth hundreds of millions of dollars and you&#39;ve already got participants in that space, we had no doubt that they were going to fill that void.&quot;<br/><br/>The new report details several illegal tobacco busts, including a Springfield man indicted last March for smuggling tobacco in from Connecticut, totaling $4 million in unpaid excise taxes, and a search warrant in Brockton last month that uncovered nearly 6,000 flavored vape products.<br/><br/>Prior to the state ban, Shaer added, the sale of these products was highly regulated, and there&#39;s now less control of what products customers are buying off the black market. <br/><br/>&quot;Now, a year and a half later, not only has the data proven that it&#39;s been a failure, but now this report confirms that we&#39;ve got a real problem, that the state unfortunately is not equipped to address,&quot; he said.<br/><br/>Anti-tobacco activists argue the ban has been a success.<br/><br/>Allyson Perron Drag of the American Heart Association says the main goal of the ban wasn&#39;t to stop current tobacco users from accessing the products.<br/><br/>&quot;It was to stop a new generation of being addicted to it, which the industry and their allies like the convenience stores, were doing,&quot; said Perron Drag, who&#39;s also a member of the advocacy group Tobacco Free Mass. &quot;They were marketing and hooking children on this deadly product. Kids that would have never used traditional cigarettes. They were using them because they were flavored... If the exposure to kids is not there anymore, so they&#39;re not seeing these products in convenience stores and in places that they&#39;re able to go into, I would say that is a success.&quot; <br/><br/>For current tobacco users, Perron Drag notes that the legislation that banned the sale of menthol cigarettes and flavored vape products also mandated that all insurance cover smoking cessation costs.<br/><br/>&quot;The convenience stores want the narrative to say [the ban is] a failure because they&#39;ve been fighting it in other places,&quot; she added. &quot;And so they don&#39;t want to see it look like a success in Massachusetts.&quot;",Craig LeMoult,Thu Mar 03 16:15:46 EST 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This type of propaganda includes racist and antisemitic fliers, banners, and stenciled graffiti. At least 12 known white supremacist groups were behind hate propaganda in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, Maine and New Hampshire. <br/><br/>But in New England, the ADL says two groups are behind the biggest increase in activity: Patriot Front, a white nationalist hate group, and the National Socialist Club, a neo-Nazi group also known as NSC 131, which reportedly now focuses its activity on New England.

They are sort of lured into these groups through these seemingly innocuous fliers,” said Shukur. “Like in New England, you know, it evokes football. It doesn&#39;t evoke white supremacist activity... and for some, they stay with it.”<br/><br/>White supremacists have targeted several college campuses in Massachusetts, including Boston University and Framingham State University. Dan Magazu, a spokesperson for Framingham State, said there have been several incidents where propaganda stickers connected to the Patriot Front were placed around campus, including most recently in December. Magazu said the university has an ongoing investigation into these incidents.<br/><br/>“Obviously it’s very upsetting. We’re absolutely determined to get to the bottom of this,” Magazu said. “We have an increasingly diverse campus, and our students are really engaged in issues of social justice and racism.” <i> </i><br/><br/>While white supremacist protests and flash mobs were more prevalent in other parts of the country, said Shukur, in New England groups were “upping their game,” with a recent <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/22/us/neo-nazis-providence-library.html"" target=""_blank"">protest by Neo-Nazis at a library</a> in Providence and <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2022/02/02/neo-nazis-target-anti-racist-doctors-at-brigham-and-womens-hospital-calling-them-anti-white"" target=""_blank"">another at Brigham and Women’s Hospital</a> in Boston by NSC 131.

The court also said the judge did not sufficiently question the jurors about their news consumption of the bombing.<br/><br/>The Supreme Court’s ruling Friday addresses those issues, but the case will now return to the Circuit Court of Appeals to litigate other problems, such as jurors lying about posting on social media about the case. <br/><br/>Massachusetts U.S. Attorney <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2022/02/07/u-s-attorney-rachael-rollins-calls-for-inclusion-of-neo-nazis-in-gang-database"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>Rachael Rollins affirmed</u></a> in February that if U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland chooses to seek the death penalty, her office would have to follow.<br/><br/>Gertner said the legal world was surprised that the Supreme Court took up the case, and that Friday’s ruling was expected. “Everyone was shocked that the Supreme Court took this case,” she said. “This was … hardly the kind of legal or issue or principle issue of national importance that you would expect the Supreme Court to take.”<br/><br/>“When they took it, we all knew what the outcome would be,” Gertner added. All three liberal justices dissented from the ruling.<br/><br/>The recent rulings connected with the Boston Marathon bombing case do not question Tsarnaev’s guilt, but rather if the death penalty is warranted. <br/><br/>Gertner said the fact that a case like this will take a long time to reach a final decision is a good thing. “The appeals process is precisely because we appropriately say that death is different,” Gertner said. &quot;There will be rounds [of appeals] after this, there always are, and that&#39;s how it should be.&quot;<br/><br/>A prolonged appeals process means that victims seeking closure will have to wait further.  “The case is not going to be over for a while,&quot; Gertner said, &quot;there will not be quote ‘closure’ for the victims for many, many, many years.”<br/>",Rebecca Tauber,Fri Mar 04 14:04:29 EST 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Later in the day, the crowd split into two smaller groups gathering on the Boston Common, each representing a different way forward for an end to the conflict. <br/> <br/>Near Park St. station, around 75 people from anti-war groups around the state held signs reading “no to NATO expansion” and “the U.S. war machine is the real threat to peace.” <br/> <br/>Foreign military involvement would only intensify and worsen the conflict, Dr. Joseph Gerson, Executive Director of the Campaign for Peace, Disarmament and Common Security, told the crowd. <br/> <br/>“Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine and repeated threats to resort to genocidal nuclear war if the West intervenes more directly have to be universally condemned and opposed,” Gerson said. “We must press for an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of all foreign troops from Ukraine in negotiations.” <br/>Russian-American activist Michael Victor argued that pitting &quot;imperialist&quot; powers against one another in the name of peace has never been an effective strategy. <br/> <br/>“They&#39;re just putting more pressure and they&#39;re putting more money into wasted hands because they want the war machine to continue,” Victor said, gesturing over to the crowd across the park at the bandstand. “Whereas over here, we want peace and respect.”<br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1646613072716,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1646613072716,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017f-61c7-d83b-a97f-75d73aad0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-61c7-d19f-a3ff-efd72e540000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-61c7-d19f-a3ff-efd72e290000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">IMG_9444.jpg</bsp-image><br/>At the bandstand, around 200 people at a rally organized by the Ukrainian Cultural Center of New England held Ukrainian flags and chanted “glory to Ukraine.” <br/> <br/>“Ukrainian people are fighting strong, but they need help.

Article,4 things to know about the surge in gas prices — and how to make the most of each gallon,4 things to know about the surge in gas prices — and how to make the most of each gallon,"Gas prices have surged to historic levels in Massachusetts amid uncertainty surrounding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and possible sanctions on the Russian oil supply. The average cost for regular unleaded gasoline in Massachusetts hit $4.16 per gallon on Monday — the highest price ever recorded in the state for regular unleaded gasoline according to Mary Maguire, spokesperson for Massachusetts AAA Northeast. The last time we saw $4 per gallon, Maguire said, was back in July 2008 during the Great Recession. <br/><br/>The average price of unleaded regular gasoline is up by $0.54 over last week, $0.72 over last month and $1.48 higher than this time last year, when the cost per gallon was $2.68. And while the costs at the pump are surging across the country, Massachusetts’ average gas price is $0.10 higher than the national average.<br/><br/>As the crisis unfolds, prices are likely to continue rising. We spoke with a few experts to learn where we might go from here — and to offer suggestions for how to stretch each gallon in the meantime.<br/><br/><b>What is the cause of the surge?</b><br/><br/>When a major global oil producer is involved in a conflict, it sends shockwaves through the oil and gasoline markets — and that translates to higher prices at the pump. That&#39;s exactly what&#39;s happening right now, Maguire said, as oil and gas markets react to the volatility of the situation between Russia and Ukraine.<br/><br/>As the United States and NATO debate whether to impose sanctions on the Russian oil and gas industry, she said we will continue to see a significant rise in prices for those goods.<br/><br/><b>How long will it last? How high will prices go?</b><br/><br/>Maguire said Americans are facing a “double whammy&quot;: a price spike occurring at the same time as increased demand for travel. As pandemic restrictions ease, the weather improves and gatherings such as graduations, barbecues and other celebrations resume, more people are getting back in their cars to travel.<br/><br/>“The $0.45 increase in gas prices here in the U.S. over the past seven days amounts to the single largest increase since AAA has tracked domestic gas prices,&quot; Maguire said, adding that, &quot;the negative impact of these explosive prices on American consumers will only increase in the near term.&quot;<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1646690070737,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-62e6-dde0-ad63-fbf6275a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1646690070737,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-62e6-dde0-ad63-fbf6275a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017f-4523-d19f-a3ff-ef378e580001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017f-2848-d6af-a77f-7a6c17920003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017f-5c18-d19f-a3ff-ff1dd0980000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-665f-d83b-a97f-775f2157002a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-665f-d83b-a97f-775f21180000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>Back in 2008, when economic growth outpaced oil production, prices rose to $145 a barrel. Right now, we’re seeing approximately $130 a barrel. Maguire said that as crude oil prices rise, so do prices at the pump. <br/><br/>According to Bill McKibben, author and environmentalist, the American people’s willingness to impose sanctions and support a U.S. policy could be key as to whether gas prices keep increasing. <br/><br/>During World War II, he said, people made personal sacrifices like taking the bus instead of driving or carpooling in order to support U.S. sanctions against Germany. But, McKibben said, Americans now are perhaps too “pampered” to make those kinds of changes in their daily lives. McKibben reflected on posters from World War II that had the tagline, “When you drive alone, you drive with Hitler.” He said the 3% to 4% of people driving electric vehicles could help make a difference by carpooling with other people.<br/><br/><b>Is there support for the U.S. imposing sanctions on Russian oil?</b><br/><br/>The oil market is a bull market with multiple sources of supply, including OPEC and Russia, according to Massachusetts Congressman Jake Auchincloss, who represents the 4th Congressional District.<br/><br/>It’s hard to pinpoint a direct cause and effect with so many sources in a global market of supply and demand, Auchincloss said. The surge in gasoline affects everyone’s wallet. He added, “this increase really pinches people at the kitchen table. It is taking a big bite out of wage gains that we have seen, and it&#39;s forcing people to make painful tradeoffs in how they consume.”<br/><br/>Since oil is the most important export from Russia, Auchincloss said, the U.S. needs to cut off Vladimir Putin from the fossil fuel industry. <br/><br/>“I think this is going to turbocharge our transition to a clean energy economy,” Auchincloss said. This crisis will thrust Europe’s transition to energy independence, he added, and “just as we used these sanctions to punish and isolate Russia, we should also be sure to use the sanctions as an off-ramp.” Meaning, if the sanctions work and Putin ceases the war, the end result would protect Ukrainian civilians.<br/><br/>“That’s our primary objective to stop the violence and suffering,” Auchincloss added.<br/><bsp-tweet data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1646695024823,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000168-2a01-dff6-a1ef-fabd12060000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1646695024823,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000168-2a01-dff6-a1ef-fabd12060000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;tweet&quot;:{&quot;embedCode&quot;:&quot;%3Cblockquote%20class%3D%22twitter-tweet%22%3E%3Cp%20lang%3D%22en%22%20dir%3D%22ltr%22%3EIn%20Congress%2C%20we%E2%80%99re%20putting%20pressure%20on%20the%20Biden%20administration%20to%20move%20on%20energy%20sanctions.%3Cbr%3E%3Cbr%3EI%20called%20for%20cutting%20off%20oil%2C%20coal%2C%20and%20natural%20gas%2C%20and%20we%E2%80%99re%20now%20seeing%20bipartisan%20movement%20on%20those%20sanctions%20in%20the%20Senate.%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Ft.co%2FUSgTW1q8RR%22%3Epic.twitter.com%2FUSgTW1q8RR%3C%2Fa%3E%3C%2Fp%3E%26mdash%3B%20Rep.%20Jake%20Auchincloss%20%28%40RepAuchincloss%29%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FRepAuchincloss%2Fstatus%2F1500835895158714370%3Fref_src%3Dtwsrc%255Etfw%22%3EMarch%207%2C%202022%3C%2Fa%3E%3C%2Fblockquote%3E%20%3Cscript%20async%20src%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fplatform.twitter.com%2Fwidgets.js%22%20charset%3D%22utf-8%22%3E%3C%2Fscript%3E&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-66ab-d837-a97f-7eebf9b90000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a3c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-66ab-d837-a97f-7eebf9940000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a3c0002&quot;}"">Tweet</bsp-tweet><br/><br/><br/>Eighty percent of Americans who participated in <u><a href=""https://www.reuters.com/world/us/exclusive-americans-broadly-support-ukraine-no-fly-zone-russia-oil-ban-poll-2022-03-04/"" target=""_blank"">a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll</a></u> said they support the U.S. no longer buying Russian oil, the majority of whom said it would be worth paying more at the pump to support another democratic country.<br/><br/><b>Can we do anything to slow or stop rising prices?</b><br/><br/>AAA recommends these fuel-saving tips:<br/><ul><li>Use regular gas instead of premium. Opting for premium gas when your car doesn’t require it will not improve fuel economy, but it will cost you more money.</li><li>Shop around to find the best gas price in your area.</li><li>Utilize points and rewards programs at places such as Costco, BJ&#39;s and Stop and Shop</li><li>Keep your vehicle in top shape with routine inspections and make sure your tires are properly inflated.</li><li>Combine errands into a single trip.

Article,Massachusetts welfare fraud continues to fall,Massachusetts welfare fraud continues to fall,"Welfare fraud in Massachusetts continues to fall from pre-pandemic levels, according to <a href=""https://www.mass.gov/doc/consolidated-program-integrity-report-0/download"" target=""_blank"">an annual state report</a> released last month. <br/><br/>Rule violations among Massachusetts’ four welfare programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Transitional Aid to Families with Dependent Children (TAFDC), decreased in 2021. Such violations range from obtaining benefits without qualifying for them to spending benefits beyond their allowed use. <br/><br/>The number of violations has decreased since the beginning of the pandemic, as the office that runs the programs — under the Department of Transitional Assistance — changed some of its procedures to focus on providing resources to those in need and suspended hearings regarding fraud investigations. <br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1646690668740,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1646690668740,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000178-d2aa-d798-a1fa-deaa97430003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017b-2bbe-dcfa-ab7f-effe20d30003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000177-43e7-d4ee-a5ff-f7e74b3e0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-6668-d83b-a97f-7778d19b002a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-6668-d83b-a97f-7778d15c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>“Nearly all individuals receiving public assistance through DTA programs use benefits as intended,” the report said. <br/><br/>Catherine Drennan Lynn, senior director of communications and public affairs for the Greater Boston Food Bank, told GBH News that the report helps break the stigma that people abuse food assistance programs like SNAP. <br/><br/>“In fact, it’s actually used really, really well and there’s such a very small margin of misuse in this program,” Lynn said. <br/><br/>Nearly 1 million Massachusetts residents use one of the four programs’ benefits. In 2021, there were 168 intentional violations and 630 unintentional violations, which together total nearly $700,000 in savings for the state, according to the report. The previous year, the total violations topped 1,000; in 2019, there were more than 4,500. <br/><br/>Likewise, the number of cases referred for criminal investigations by the state auditor’s office dropped by two-thirds compared to 2019, from over 6,000 to around 2,000. <br/><br/>The one increase noted in the report was the number of ATMs and point of sale terminals at prohibited locations, such as liquor stores and recreational marijuana dispensaries, which are blocked by the office: 683 were blocked in 2021, up from 480 in 2020. The DTA prevented approximately $20,000 of benefits being spent at dispensaries last year, according to the report. <br/><br/>Despite the low fraud rates, the report says the DTA has been adding staff to its Program Integrity Division in the last several years to monitor for fraud. Deborah Harris, a senior attorney with the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute, said those resources could be better spent elsewhere. <br/><br/>“The fault lies, not particularly in this instance, with the administration, but with the system and the rules that the Legislature created,” Harris said. <br/><br/>And as the state rolls back pandemic restrictions, Lynn worries that more violations will be issued as policy changes introduced during the pandemic will go away. <br/><br/>“There have been a lot of barriers that have been removed during COVID to make sure that this program is accessible to every individual in need,” she said, specifically regarding SNAP. “And, what we’d like to see and what we’ve been advocating for is that those waivers are permanent and that those flexibilities are permanent so that people can continue to access the program.” <br/><br/>A spokesperson for the DTA did not respond by the time of publication. <br/>",Jake Freudberg,Mon Mar 07 17:58:51 EST 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Article,"Boston anti-violence activist charged with fraud, conspiracy in federal indictment","Boston anti-violence activist charged with fraud, conspiracy in federal indictment","Local activist Monica Cannon-Grant and her husband, Clark Grant, founders of an anti-violence nonprofit Violence in Boston, were indicted Tuesday by a federal grand jury and charged with wire fraud, mail fraud, conspiracy and making false statements to a mortgage lending business. <br/><br/>Prosecutors from U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins’ office allege in the indictment that Cannon-Grant, 41, the founder and CEO of Violence in Boston, and Grant, 38, a founding director, intentionally conspired to use the nonprofit “as a vehicle to solicit and receive charitable contributions from institutional and individual donors” that they then used for “a wide range of personal expenses and to enrich themselves while concealing such expenditures from VIB directors, officers and others.” <br/><br/>The 18-count indictment alleges that between 2017 and 2021, Cannon-Grant applied for numerous public and private grants and received donations to her nonprofit, but used that money for personal expenses, including hotel reservations, groceries, gas, car rentals, auto repairs, Uber rides, nail salons, restaurants, food deliveries and personal travel.<br/><br/>&quot;We are extremely disappointed the government rushed to judgment here,&quot; Cannon-Grant&#39;s attorney Robert Goldstein said in a statement Tuesday. &quot;VIB and Monica have been fully cooperating and their production of records remains ongoing. Drawing conclusions from an incomplete factual record does not represent the fair and fully informed process a citizen deserves from its government, especially someone like Monica who has worked tirelessly on behalf of her community. We remain fully confident Monica will be vindicated when a complete factual record emerges.”<br/><br/>Cannon-Grant was arrested Tuesday morning and later released on her own recognizance following a preliminary hearing before Magistrate Judge Judith G. Dein. Federal prosecutors did not ask she be detained until her trial. Pre-trial conditions prohibit her from engaging in any employment or volunteer or unpaid positions that allow her access to monetary funds, disbursements of monetary funds, salary payments or any other financial responsibilities.<br/><br/>Adam Deitch, a federal prosecutor, expressed concern about Cannon-Grant having access to the nonprofit&#39;s funds, &quot;given the pervasiveness and flagrancy of the defendants fraud here and how it relates to the finances of this nonprofit organization.&quot; Deitch and attorney Ben Connolly, who represented Cannon-Grant, plan to negotiate her role as the CEO of Violence in Boston.<br/><br/>&quot;The sticking point there is that Ms. [Cannon-]Grant continues to run Violence in Boston,&quot; Connolly said during the hearing. &quot;They pay monthly rent in Hyde Park. They run food pantries out of Hyde Park on Wednesdays and Fridays that serve 50 to 70 individuals. So we would ask that the court not impose that condition.&quot; <br/><br/>While allegedly providing herself with a $170,092 income from the organization&#39;s coffers in 2021, prosecutors allege that Cannon-Grant “falsely represented VIB as a nonprofit that did not pay salaries or other compensation” to either Cannon-Grant or Grant. <br/><br/>The couple was also charged with fraudulently collecting federal pandemic unemployment benefits, despite being employed full-time. Grant collected $67,950 in COVID-19 unemployment benefits from May 2020 to September 2021, according to prosecutors. Cannon-Grant&#39;s pre-trial conditions prohibit her from applying for unemployment benefits, loans or grants, unless approved by the court. <br/><br/>Charges also include allegedly defrauding a mortgage company when applying for a home loan last year. The couple is accused of submitting “false information and fraudulent documentation that represented VIB assets as personal assets and concealed the fraudulent nature of Grant’s&quot; pandemic unemployment assistance income.<br/><br/>Cannon-Grant could face prison sentence of up to 20 years for each of the 13 counts of wire fraud and two counts of wire fraud conspiracy, five years for conspiracy and up to 30 years for the charge of making false statements to a mortgage lending business.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1647367160484,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1647367160484,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;Related Stories:&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-3781-d887-adfb-779b4f3c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000172-9b6b-d8c7-a977-ffffc0da0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000173-5ccc-d495-a9fb-fecdf5a10003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-8ebb-d837-a97f-defb67e60027&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-8ebb-d837-a97f-defb65550000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>Though Cannon-Grant did not immediately respond to a request for comment from GBH News, she pushed back on social media after allegations of mortgage fraud surfaced in a 2021 criminal complaint against her husband.

I’m not on the loan at all.” <br/><br/>Cannon-Grant wrote in the same thread that she was “fully cooperating” with a federal investigation of the nonprofit’s funds, dismissing the allegations as “we can’t explain her success so she has to be stealing.” <br/><br/>“A Black woman raised too much money for her non-profit and needed help organizing it all,” she <a href=""https://twitter.com/ReadyToPissUOff/status/1499731626070351874"" target=""_blank"">wrote</a>.<br/><br/>Cannon-Grant founded Violence in Boston in 2017 with the goals of reducing violence and raising social awareness and racial equity in Boston.

Article,New state seal may not be decided until 2023,New state seal may not be decided until 2023,"Activists have pushed for decades to redraw the state seal found in thousands of places around Massachusetts, from police cruisers to municipal flagpoles to lawmakers&#39; lapels, but the body tasked with rethinking that emblem has been slow to move toward any action — and on Tuesday, members began discussing yet another deadline extension.<br/><br/>At the start of 2021, lawmakers passed a statute calling for a commission to suggest alterations to the motto and the seal, which advocates have argued represents violence and oppression toward indigenous communities.<br/><br/>The seal currently in use, which dates to 1780, portrays an indigenous person on a shield. The crest above it features an arm holding a broadsword, which is also the state&#39;s military crest.

David Vieira told fellow commissioners that if the panel files its report in December, it would be technically dissolved and unable to file any proposal with the new General Court when sessions begin in January.<br/><br/>&quot;And so I think it might behoove us, maybe today, to relieve the pressure of an artificial deadline, and to really focus our work over this year, and making sure we do the appropriate public outreach, and that we have the appropriate recommendations in legislative form, that we look for a vehicle to extend the report deadline to Feb. 15, 2023,&quot; the Falmouth Republican said.<br/><br/>Vieira said, &quot;So the idea is we&#39;d complete it in 2022, but we&#39;d give ourselves that window at the beginning of the next session to formally introduce legislation that we believe should begin the legislative process.&quot;<br/><br/>Nipmuc Nation member Brittney Walley voiced support for that idea, Rep. Antonio Cabral said it &quot;probably would make sense,&quot; and Sen. Marc Pacheco said he would support an extension to &quot;at least February.&quot;<br/><br/>Vieira said a deadline extension could be tacked onto either the fiscal 2023 budget or the mid-year supplemental budget that is currently awaiting action in the Senate.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1647381557656,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1647381557656,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000175-4c8b-dc50-ab77-fd8b9fa00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0f0008&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-8f97-d19f-a3ff-ef97903c0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100002&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-8f97-d19f-a3ff-ef97900b0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>There was some discussion <a href=""https://statehousenews.com/news/2022314"" style=""color: rgb(0, 106, 199); text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-skip-ink: none;"">last month</a> about pushing for a commission report before July 31 to spur action on Beacon Hill before the end of this year&#39;s formal sessions.<br/><br/>Commission member Jim Wallace, who has lobbied at the State House for decades on behalf of the Gun Owners Action League, reiterated Tuesday why he sees that goal as impractical.<br/><br/>&quot;You do not want something like this to get into the Legislature&#39;s hands the last week in July, because it is just a nightmare in there,&quot; Wallace said. &quot;The last week of formal session, if anybody&#39;s ever seen that, and I&#39;ve seen about 25 of them, it&#39;s just a nightmare. Because everybody in the world&#39;s trying to get their bill done before they adjourn for the rest of the year.&quot;<br/><br/>Cabral added that once the House and Senate see the group&#39;s report, they would need to hold a public hearing on proposed legislation, and the topic would likely call for floor debate and a roll call vote. He said he envisions the branches facilitating a &quot;public conversation&quot; next session.<br/><br/>&quot;I just think, also, you&#39;ve got to give time for the public to have an opportunity to look, and analyze, and feel comfortable with any recommendations that we make, before the Legislature actually is able, then, to move,&quot; said Cabral, who co-chairs the State Administration and Regulatory Oversight Committee.<br/><br/>The commission&#39;s February and March meetings focused on internal governance and setting up subcommittees on various aspects of the seal and motto -- meaning the meetings have not yet delved into actual analysis or proposed revisions for the emblems.<br/><br/>Brig. Gen. Leonid Kondratiuk, historical services director for the Massachusetts National Guard, on Tuesday urged his fellow members to get moving.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#39;s important that the subcommittees meet, like, ASAP. I suggest before the end of the month. ... The main concern is, we need to meet, and we need to meet sooner,&quot; he said.<br/><br/>Those subcommittees are where the &quot;substantive discussion&quot; and &quot;heavy lifting&quot; of the commission&#39;s work will take place, said Michael Comeau, executive director of the State Archives.<br/><br/>But whether those meetings will be open to the public was left as an open question Tuesday. Several members indicated interest in seeking a legal opinion on whether the Open Meeting Law would apply to subcommittees, and whether they would have to publicly post and livestream those meetings.<br/><br/>Co-chair Brian Boyles said he hoped to gain &quot;clarity&quot; on Open Meeting Law requirements soon, so that the subcommittees dealing with seal history and design could meet and prepare presentations ahead of the next full commission meeting on April 19.<br/><br/>The other co-chair, Brian Moswetah Weeden, said next month&#39;s agenda will include a proposed deadline extension and further talk about subcommittees.<br/>",Sam Doran | State House News Service,Tue Mar 15 17:59:21 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Charlie Baker&#39;s pandemic response.

So far, the UN estimates <a href=""https://www.barrons.com/amp/news/nearly-3-5-million-ukrainians-flee-the-country-un-01647864606"" target=""_blank"">nearly 3.5 million people</a> have fled Ukraine. The congressman said some of the trains pulled into the station with as many as 2,500 people on board. <br/><br/>“Over two days, they had over 20 trains come in,” Lynch said, noting that he&#39;s witnessed the division of families as husbands and fathers escort wives and young children to areas close to the Ukraine border, then go back to fight. “That’s the saddest part of this.” <br/><br/>In other times of displacement, Lynch has seen huge camps set up for thousands of people in the Middle East. “In this case, every single refugee is being accepted into a private home,” he said. But he warned that Polish residents’ capacity to take in people is quickly declining and eventually could result in refugee camps. <br/><br/>Lynch said that most refugees want to go to Europe, but outside of that the U.S. and Canada were the two top choices, and most of those refugees are being flown to the U.S. to be with families and extended families. <br/><br/>On the politics of the invasion, Lynch stood by his stance in supporting the U.S. government’s position against a no-fly zone over Ukraine. <br/><br/>“If there was a way to do it, if it was effective, sure, I’d be in favor of it without creating World War III,” he said. <br/><br/>He explained that an established no-fly zone over Ukraine would require U.S. forces to shoot down Russian aircraft. In addition, he said most of the Russian fighting tactics against Kyiv, Kharkiv and other major cities are comprised of long-range artillery, and a no-fly zone wouldn’t help those barrages. <br/><br/>Lynch also commented on Zelenskyy’s <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/ukraine-russia-war-live-updates-biden-warns-putin-s-back-n1292573/ncrd1292577#liveBlogCards"" target=""_blank"">efforts to make a deal with Russia</a> by proposing a cease-fire plan that would involve his country’s pledge not to seek membership with NATO. <br/><br/>“I tend to think that’s not a good move, but, you know, President Zelenskyy, his citizens are being massacred,” Lynch said. “The Russians are killing his children and civilian population and he’s under a lot of pressure. ... He’s doing a hell of a job and is absolutely heroic.” <br/><br/>Lynch added that he believes Zelenskyy and Ukraine’s future is with Europe and the EU. But, he said, negotiations with Russia are up to Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian government. <br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1647976899430,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1647976899430,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;quote&quot;:&quot;“The one incalculable in war is the human will.”&quot;,&quot;attribution&quot;:&quot;Rep.

Congress approved $13.6 billion <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/18/upshot/ukraine-aid-details.html"" target=""_blank"">in emergency aid to Ukraine</a> for refugees, military aid and equipment. Ukrainians are thankful for the American presence, he said, but “they’re fearful of what might happen next.”<br/><br/>In terms of how Americans can help from the United States, Lynch said Ukraine-based NGOs and advocacy groups “have asked us to have people send cash donations to reputable agencies” like the Ukraine Red Cross and the Polish Red Cross, who are on the ground to provide relief to refugees.<br/><br/>On Monday, Lynch traveled to the Mihail Kogălniceanu base in Romania to visit with U.S. troops where there were nine other countries represented including Britain, Romania, Australia and New Zealand. He said there is a real coalition there who sees “the wrongfulness in what Putin is doing.”<br/><br/>Lynch&#39;s next stop will be Vienna to meet with the heads of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Normally, Lynch said, the agency inspects and monitors the 15 reactors in Ukraine, including the Chernobyl nuclear plant.

She rose to become the first female Secretary of State of the United States. <br/><br/>Rhode Island Congressman David Cicilline told GBH News on Wednesday that he had the “privilege” of working with her on several occasions. <br/><br/>“She was an extraordinary woman, broke the ceiling of being the first woman Secretary of State but was also a voice for democracy and human rights around the world, warned about the growing totalitarianism around the world and our responsibility to stand up for our democracy,” Cicilline said. “We’ve lost a great intellect, a great leader, a magnificent person and I feel very privileged to have known her.”<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1648081448921,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-62e6-dde0-ad63-fbf6275a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1648081448921,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-62e6-dde0-ad63-fbf6275a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f667-d1e7-a772-fff71a490000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-3780-d887-adfb-779a15dc0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-3780-d887-adfb-779a13170000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-b94d-de45-afff-bffdd9720017&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-b94d-de45-afff-bffdd9420000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>A lifelong Democrat who nonetheless worked to bring Republicans into her orbit, Albright was nominated in 1996 by President Bill Clinton to be America&#39;s top diplomat, elevating her from U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, where she had been only the second woman to hold that job.<br/><br/>Before her success in politics, Albright studied at<b> </b>Wellesley College and graduated in 1959. Stacie Goddard, a political science professor, now directs the college’s <a href=""https://www.wellesley.edu/albright/about"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>Albright Institute for Global Affairs</u></a>. <br/><br/>“She talked about Wellesley as the place that really made her who she was,” said Goddard, “both through her friendships, and through what she learned; and in many ways, I think she would describe her experience at Wellesley in the Boston area as really kind of setting the foundation for who she became.” <br/><br/>Goddard said Albright was “incredibly active” in the institute, which selects 40 juniors and seniors for an intensive training in global affairs each year, and that she was committed to empowering young women.<br/><br/>“She would think about how she could help them in their careers. She was always willing to share her own stories, diplomatic or personal,” Goddard said. “She was somebody who approached her career believing that diplomacy was about showing empathy and having humor, even in difficult situations. But she would also still stand by her principles. She never lost sight of that…and I think it&#39;s something that honestly became a model for all of us that got a chance to interact with her.”<br/><br/>Albright&#39;s reputation for mentorship extended beyond her alma mater. In a statement on her passing, Massachusetts Congressman Seth Moulton said that he sought out her advice on several occasions. <br/><br/>“Few people have done more to serve our country,” Moulton wrote, “yet she was also tireless in her retirement, investing in the next generation as a teacher, mentor, and friend. She will be missed, not only for her history-making, public moments, but also in the quiet times, in the classroom or in late-night consultations, guiding the next generation of diplomats.<br/><br/>“I have the fondest memories of sitting around her living room with titans of foreign policy and young amateurs like myself during my first years in Congress,” he continued. “Every time I called her for advice, she would take more time than I ever imagined, and then ask when I would call next.”<br/><br/>Goddard cited Albright’s experiences as an immigrant as shaping her outlook on foreign policy as well as her views of her own responsibility in the United States. Goddard recalled the memories Albright had shared of being a refugee: leaving Czechoslovakia before World War II, living in London during the Blitz, then returning to her home country after the war before ultimately moving to the United States to escape communism. <br/><br/>“This might sound somewhat corny, but it was very sincere — there&#39;s a reason she was committed to public service and the United States,” Goddard said, “and I think that&#39;s because she felt really deeply, it was one place, if not the only place, in the world where somebody like her could make a home, and somebody like her could become a secretary of state.”<br/><br/><i>This article includes reporting from the Associated Press.</i>",Mark Herz,Wed Mar 23 20:29:39 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,"Baker administration offers employers $4,000 to hire more workers","Baker administration offers employers $4,000 to hire more workers","Gov. Charlie Baker’s administration this week launched a program that gives businesses $4,000 for each new employee they hire through the end of the year. <br/><br/>Industry experts have mixed opinions on whether the effort will meet the need for skilled workers. Critics say companies don’t need further incentives to hire staff, and that the $50 million in federal pandemic relief funds could have been better spent elsewhere. Proponents, however, believe the program offers companies needed flexibility.<br/><br/>In a Wednesday press conference announcing the program, dubbed “HireNow,” Secretary of Labor and Workforce Development Rosalin Acosta said she hopes companies that are struggling to find workers can hire people from different fields and use the funds to cover training and education expenses.<br/><br/>“The biggest complaint we hear so many times is that they can&#39;t see themselves in the jobs that are available. They don&#39;t know how to get there,” Acosta said. <br/><br/>Greg Beeman, president of the Associated Builders and Contractors of Massachusetts, said training is a significant barrier for bringing new people into the field. He believes the program can bridge that gap.<br/><br/>“We think it offers a real significant means to help bring new people into the construction industry, an industry that needs new talent and that offers good career opportunities,” Beeman said.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1648246898406,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1648246898406,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017f-b8b5-df74-a57f-f8ffb5780002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017f-7a9b-d19f-a3ff-ff9f39e10003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-9bd6-d8b0-adfe-9ff746590000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-c32b-d191-a1ff-f32b2e0a0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-c32b-d191-a1ff-f32b2d0b0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>But not everyone is excited about the program. Evan Horowitz, the executive director of the Center for State Policy Analysis at Tufts University, said the program seems to provide an incentive for companies to hire more people, but companies don’t need that incentive. <br/><br/>“There isn&#39;t a problem to be solved with getting employers to hire people. Employers are desperately trying to hire people,” Horowitz said.<br/><br/>Unlike other similar programs, employers are free to use the funds in whatever way they see fit, and they are not required to submit any documents detailing exactly what the funds were used for, according to the <a href=""https://commcorp.org/hirenow/hire-now-guidelines/"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>guidelines for the application process</u></a>. Employers only have to prove that the employees were employed for at least 60 days and paid between $14.25 and $42.50 an hour. <br/><br/>Horowitz said he thinks the program could be more limiting in how companies could use the stipends to further encourage equity in hiring. But Beeman thinks this flexibility is necessary because companies could use the money in very different ways. <br/><br/>“Company cultures are different. Company approaches are different. Some companies have very specific niches. … I think the flexibility is a real asset to this program because it doesn&#39;t pigeonhole every employer to have to use the money in exactly the same way,” Beeman said.<br/><br/>Horowitz said he thinks the Baker administration should have used the funds to incentivize workers to go back to work by providing social services like childcare or reentry programs for people who have retired. <br/><br/>“I have a lot of respect for the way the administration pursues policy. … They’re traditionally very thoughtful about the challenge that they&#39;re identifying and the ways that they want to approach that challenge,” Horowitz said. “And I think in some ways, that&#39;s the reason this stands out.”",Olivia Marble,Fri Mar 25 18:28:59 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Founder and CEO of the nonprofit organization Violence in Boston, Cannon-Grant is accused of raiding the collected money and grants donated to her organization for her own use. <br/><br/>The news hit hard for those who’ve come to admire her grit and determination. She galvanized thousands for local justice marches and pivoted to feed hungry desperate people during the pandemic. <br/><br/>Full disclosure: I interviewed Cannon-Grant last year as she became well known in grassroots organizing and local leadership circles. Boston Magazine named her “the best social justice advocate” in Boston, and in 2020 The Boston Globe named her one of the &quot;Bostonians of the Year.&quot;<br/><br/>Cannon-Grant and her husband, Clark Grant, face an 18-count indictment spread over 38 pages.

According to the indictment, the couple had “exclusive control” of the nonprofit’s funds. They used “cash withdrawals, cashed checks, debit purchases, and transfers to personal bank accounts” to buy gas, hotel rooms, groceries, and trips to nail salons. Particularly upsetting is that Cannon-Grant and her husband are charged with spending $6,000 on a vacation with funds specifically donated for a Philadelphia-based Violence Prevention retreat for at-risk kids. <br/><br/>Still, Cannon-Grant is innocent until proven guilty. She has been accused but is not yet convicted of these charges. Her attorney, Rob Goldstein, told The Boston Globe, “We remain fully confident Monica will be vindicated when a complete factual record emerges.”<br/><br/>I wrestled with multiple emotions as I listened to the news reports of her alleged transgressions — waves of nausea roiled my stomach, my eyes welled with tears, and my skin burned hot with anger. I don’t personally know Cannon-Grant. But I do know that her downfall will unfairly and especially taint other Bostonians of color because It will be doubly hard for anybody who comes behind her if anybody else is allowed to follow.<br/><br/>Longtime critics are savoring what they believe is a long-overdue comeuppance for the no-holds-barred Cannon-Grant and a negligent lack of financial oversight for Violence In Boston. <br/><br/>There is no question that African Americans who are publicly prominent bear both the pride of the community and the weight of communal expectations. She wouldn’t be the first to have buckled under the burden of carrying it all. But she left the rest of us holding the bag for having believed. <br/><br/>I feel let down, disappointed, and worse, betrayed.",Callie Crossley,Mon Mar 28 11:11:42 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But debate is a skill, and requires its own unique rules that many adults are clearly unfamiliar with. As Ash Heeley of Josiah Quincy Upper School put it: “Adults arguing is very messy, and some of them don&#39;t even make the correct points and stuff.” These kids know how argument works; they’ll be alright.<br/><br/>The handful of months on either side of the cusp of adolescence is a mystifying one. You&#39;re beginning to understand your place in the world; you&#39;re beginning to have opinions and form valid and logical arguments  and yet it’s easy to feel like the adults in the room aren’t taking you seriously. You aren&#39;t a child, per se, but you are far from an adult and you are relative light years away from the fully formed brain that develops in the mid-20s.<br/><br/>Boston University child development researcher Jonathan Zaff thinks about this a lot, and explained this period of brain activity. &quot;Your whole brain is the house, and the first zero to five years is when you&#39;re creating infrastructure for your house,&quot; he said.<br/><br/>This what-goes-on-inside-the-building metaphor can be extended into the real world, considering Zaff&#39;s observation of Debate-Inspired Classrooms, a BDL program that features coaches working with teachers to bring the spirit of debate into the classroom. As Zaff pointed out, &quot;in our new world order of misinformation you can see the application of those debate skills being really essential; to be able to interrogate information, and to ask &#39;what is your source?&#39; &#39;why did you say that?&#39; &#39;let me, interrogate your source and say, that&#39;s a bad source.&#39;&quot; <br/><br/>American classrooms, he argued, aren&#39;t generally equipped to handle these kinds of interactions. Programs like Debate-Inspired Classrooms reassess this fixed idea of learning, encouraging teachers to think of themselves as facilitators in discussion, and welcome students to needle them and further explain their reasoning.<br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1648669317519,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-62e6-dde0-ad63-fbf6275a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1648669317519,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-62e6-dde0-ad63-fbf6275a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017f-cca7-de45-afff-cfb77e9e0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;Middle school students prepare for the debate finals.&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-d35e-df74-a57f-fbde136d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-d35e-df74-a57f-fbde13330000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">Middle School Finals</bsp-image>Kim Willingham, the BDL&#39;s director, delights in this level of youth involvement.

But her conviction is so great that the skills it imparts are indispensable that she’s driven to bring the spirit of debate to those who don&#39;t actively seek it. &quot;I especially think for young people of color, it is important because so often they are rendered invisible; they are told to be quiet,&quot; she explained. &quot;I think [debate] is really powerful, and it&#39;s a tool that they can use, whether it&#39;s saying &#39;I&#39;m the right candidate for a job&#39; or &#39;I&#39;m the right person to get into your school.&#39; I think it amplifies their agency and just equips them with skills that they need and can use in the world.”<br/><br/>But amidst all the theorizing about how great debate can be for kids, it&#39;s important not to forget one crucial fact: most kids that debate <i>love </i>it. &quot;I&#39;ve never really done debate before,&quot; said Jason Furtado of the BCLA/McCormack School. &quot;I never heard of it. I just joined it because I heard that it would get my grade up. But actually, after I joined, it was a very fun experience.&quot;<br/><br/>Talk to enough middle and high schoolers and you realize that this is a community; debate kids, like band kids and theater kids, occupy their own social space. Take Evelyn Flores and Ana Luna Maldonado, both juniors, of the Somerville debate team. For the former, debate was a space that allowed her to &quot;come out of her shell,&quot; while the latter appreciated how it helped her &quot;find a group of friends and expand her social circle,&quot; even though she is shy and introverted.<br/><br/>For junior and debate president Eliana Rivas of Fenway High School, debate was so important to her that she brought it back to her school after a two year hiatus. &quot;COVID hit in my sophomore year, I was doing debate on my own,&quot; Rivas recalled. &quot;We didn&#39;t have a coach... My partner wasn&#39;t feeling like doing debate online, so I had to do it on my own. But I know how beneficial debate was for me throughout this whole time and the opportunities that it brought me, so I really wanted to start debate again.&quot; <br/><br/>After a season of self-coaching and competing alongside students from Brighton, Rivas worked with her principal at Fenway to bring in a coach and revive the debate team. In February, they placed second in the city championships, after competing in just one other tournament in their latest incarnation. <br/><br/>Last week, current events and debate coalesced as student debaters found a fellow enthusiast in Ketanji Brown Jackson who thanked her high school debate coach during the Supreme Court confirmation hearing. <br/><bsp-tweet data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1648669798246,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-62e6-dde0-ad63-fbf6275a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1648669798246,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-62e6-dde0-ad63-fbf6275a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;tweet&quot;:{&quot;embedCode&quot;:&quot;%3Cblockquote%20class%3D%22twitter-tweet%22%3E%3Cp%20lang%3D%22en%22%20dir%3D%22ltr%22%3EIn%20today%26%2339%3Bs%20Supreme%20Court%20Confirmation%20Hearing%2C%20Ketanji%20Brown%20Jackson%20thanked%20her%20high%20school%20debate%20coach%2C%20Fran%20Berger%2C%20for%20believing%20in%20her%20and%20showing%20her%20what%20was%20possible.%3Cbr%3E%3Cbr%3EOver%20500%20coaches%20in%20our%20network%20do%20this%20life-changing%20work%20everyday%20and%20we%20are%20so%20thankful%20for%20them.%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Ft.co%2FLbBnVkh9x2%22%3Epic.twitter.com%2FLbBnVkh9x2%3C%2Fa%3E%3C%2Fp%3E%26mdash%3B%20NAUDL%20%28%40NAUDL1%29%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FNAUDL1%2Fstatus%2F1506012867098820608%3Fref_src%3Dtwsrc%255Etfw%22%3EMarch%2021%2C%202022%3C%2Fa%3E%3C%2Fblockquote%3E%20%3Cscript%20async%20src%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fplatform.twitter.com%2Fwidgets.js%22%20charset%3D%22utf-8%22%3E%3C%2Fscript%3E&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-dc60-df38-a17f-dde1a0c40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a3c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-dc60-df38-a17f-dde1a09c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a3c0002&quot;}"">Tweet</bsp-tweet><br/><br/>Her remarks resonated at last week’s city championship.

Article,Owner of firm overseeing Government Center garage demolition has history of OSHA violations,Owner of firm overseeing Government Center garage demolition has history of OSHA violations,"The owner of the company in charge of demolishing the Government Center garage when it partially collapsed last weekend has a history of worker safety violations, according to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration.<br/> <br/>Peter Monsini, a 51-year-old construction worker, was operating an excavator when the garage floor collapsed on Saturday, causing a fatal nine-story fall. Monsini was employed by JDC Demolition, a sub-contractor that was overseeing the demolition.<br/><br/>OSHA, Boston Police and the Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office are investigating Monsini’s death at the downtown construction site, as well as any possible negligence by JDC Demolition. <br/><br/>David Howe has owned JDC Demolition since 2012, and a second construction company, the J. Derenzo Company, since 2001. Both companies share an address on Howard Street in Brockton. Howe is not named in OSHA’s online records, but J. Derenzo Company has paid OSHA more than $66,000 since 2013 for creating hazardous working conditions on five construction sites. <br/><br/>Jodi Sugarman-Brozan, executive director of the Massachusetts Coalition for Occupational Safety and Health, said J. Derenzo’s worker safety record is troubling. <br/><br/>“OSHA knows the history,” she told GBH News. “It is always concerning when you see companies that have a record of unsafe work conditions working these huge projects.”<br/><br/>Sugarman-Brozan said that Monsini is the 67th construction worker in the state to die from on-the-job injuries in the last five years.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1648593198737,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1648593198737,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017f-183c-d83b-a97f-7d7c899c0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-c18c-d8d4-a5ff-d98dd9080003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-d7ce-d191-a1ff-f7eeaf050011&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-d7ce-d191-a1ff-f7eeae190000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>The Massachusetts Coalition for Occupational Safety and Health also issued a statement saying how dangerous demolition work is, requiring frequent safety inspections to prevent collapses.<br/><br/>“At worksites like the garage, the strength of the floors should have been evaluated and known so employers know how much machinery and debris can safely be on a floor,” the workers coalition wrote.<br/><br/>Four years ago, a worker for J. Derenzo was killed while operating an excavator during construction of the Encore casino in Everett. OSHA did not find any violations by the company related to that fatality.<br/><br/>After GBH News reached out to Howe, a spokeswoman for J. Derenzo and JDC Demolition, Jessica Tocco, responded by email, saying that the companies have incurred no OSHA violations in the last four years while its construction workers logged more than three million hours. <br/><br/>That is true, but JDC Demolition has been under OSHA scrutiny with at least seven inspections since 2013 — three of them triggered by worker complaints. The company successfully fought OSHA to withdraw two fines totaling more than $17,000. <a href=""https://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/establishment.search?p_logger=1&amp;establishment=derenzo&amp;State=all&amp;officetype=all&amp;Office=all&amp;sitezip=&amp;p_case=all&amp;p_violations_exist=all&amp;startmonth=03&amp;startday=29&amp;startyear=2017&amp;endmonth=03&amp;endday=29&amp;endyear=2022"" target=""_blank"">J. Derenzo has seen six OSHA inspections since 2018</a>, according to the federal agency&#39;s website.<br/><br/>Both companies posted about Monsini’s death on social media, saying that they were “deeply saddened by the tragic incident” and that “there are no words that appropriately describe the loss.”<br/><br/>JDC Demolition is a subcontractor on <a href=""http://jdcdemoinc.com/projects/government-center-garage "" target=""_blank"">the $408 million redevelopment of the parking garage into a 43-story office tower</a>. The developer is HYM Investments and the general contractor is John Moriarty and Associates. JDC’s website describes the project in detail, stating how they are removing beams and concrete slabs that weigh more than 95,000 pounds and using saws and cranes during off-hours because the garage was still being actively used for parking. <br/><br/>State Rep. Michelle DuBois, a Brockton Democrat, told GBH News that people in her district are grieving for Monsini and his family.<br/><br/>“We&#39;re really hurting here in Brockton. Peter Monsini went to Brockton Public Schools and graduated from Brockton High in 1988,” she said.<br/><br/>DuBois also said the state needs to do a better job of protecting construction workers. <a href=""https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/H1966"" target=""_blank"">She has co-authored legislation</a> that would require companies bidding on state and municipal contracts worth over $50,000 to disclose OSHA violations committed in the previous four years.<br/><br/>“If someone is undercutting bids because they&#39;re undercutting safety measures, the market then goes down to that level. And that&#39;s what we don&#39;t want,” said DuBois. “We want to set a high enough standard for safety that they don&#39;t get the contract unless they are standing up at that level of safety.” ",Chris Burrell,Tue Mar 29 18:36:37 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,"Mass. commission says worker training, child care are key to equitable economic recovery","Mass. commission says worker training, child care are key to equitable economic recovery","From a lack of affordable housing to the cost of child care, a legislative commission tasked with looking at ways the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the economy identified key obstacles with long roots that it says must be addressed in Massachusetts to help people grow into the jobs of the future.<br/><br/>The new report, produced by the Future of Work Commission, went beyond looking at what it will take to match employers with properly trained workers to also examine what types of supports workers will need to help them succeed in those jobs.<br/><br/>Massachusetts will need to adapt its workforce training, public transit fares and schedules and child care systems to better assist workers in a post COVID-19 economy, the commission recommended Tuesday. The report also warned that regional and racial disparities in income will also widen without intervention as white collar professions shift more easily to hybrid and remote work models, while service and manufacturing jobs offer less flexibility.<br/><br/>&quot;The future of work ain&#39;t what it used to be,&quot; joked Rep. Josh Cutler, who co-chaired the commission along with Sen. Eric Lesser.<br/><br/>The <a href=""http://www.statehousenews.com/content/docs/2022/03-29FutureofWorkReport.pdf"" style=""color: rgb(0, 106, 199); text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-skip-ink: none;"">53-page report</a> is the culmination of nearly a year of work and concluded that hybrid and remote work models are &quot;here to stay,&quot; bringing with them shifts in the demand for office space and housing.<br/><br/>Workers, the commission said, will need more flexible supports to succeed, including affordable child- and elder-care options, housing, and public transit schedules and fares that reflect new commuting patterns. State-funded workforce training also should be less rigid, the report concluded, and the state should promote &quot;stackable credentialing&quot; that would allow workers ongoing access to job training without the need to commit to a two-year or four-year college program.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1648594977866,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1648594977866,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017f-c327-d191-a1ff-f32f08130003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017f-b8b5-df74-a57f-f8ffb5780002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017f-8a07-d6af-a77f-da27cc0e0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-d7ea-de45-afff-dfff48bb0010&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-d7ea-de45-afff-dfff47e80000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>The findings, in many ways, reflect some of the challenges that have already been identified by policymakers as obstacles to a post-pandemic economic recovery for all residents. Gov. Charlie Baker previously commissioned a &quot;Future of Work&quot; report from McKinsey and Co. that identified a lack of housing and child care options as an impediment to recovery, and predicted a shift in jobs away from the traditional urban centers around which transit and business has been developed.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#39;re obviously in a time of profound change,&quot; Lesser said during a hearing Tuesday when the commission finalized and voted to file its report with the Legislature.<br/><br/>While the report did not identify many concrete actions the Legislature should take to address its findings, Lesser noted that the Legislature in the coming months will be considering health care, economic development and long-term transportation funding bills where money could be prioritized for the needs identified by the commission.<br/><br/>&quot;The timing couldn&#39;t be better given the multiple vehicles for funding and policy that we&#39;re going to be grappling with in the Legislature,&quot; added Sen. Adam Hinds, another member of the commission who, like Lesser, is running for lieutenant governor.<br/><br/>In addition to higher salaries for child care workers, legislators and other commission members recommend prioritizing state funding to subsidize early education for working families so that they can fully participate in the workforce and have the time to learn new skills for future employment opportunities.<br/><br/>Commissioners also encouraged the careful regulation of automated hiring and recruitment tools that they said can lead to employment discrimination, and making sure workers have access to mental health support.<br/><br/>The report said that during the course of the commission&#39;s work, which began in the spring of 2021, commissioners expanded the scope of the study from the intersection of new technologies and work to include an examination of supports like public transit patterns, lifelong learning models, child- and elder-care, housing accessibility, and more.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#39;s so refreshing to hear we&#39;re not just talking about placement rates,&quot; said Miriam Ortiz, director of education and training at Just-A-Start Corporation.<br/><br/>Secretary of Labor and Workforce Development Rosalin Acosta said coordination with academic institutions will be key to meeting employer needs.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#39;s equally important to keep them in that job, and that retention piece is probably the hardest part,&quot; Acosta said.<br/><br/>Lesser said that new technology and other rapid changes in workplaces are projected to displace 300,000 to 400,000 workers in Massachusetts who will need to be reskilled for careers in growing sectors like robotics, life sciences and biotech.<br/><br/>The Baker administration and the commission agree that the state will need to ramp up its workforce training initiatives to prepare 30,000 to 40,000 workers a year for new jobs, which is double the current rate.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#39;re actually probably already behind,&quot; Lesser said.<br/><br/>Acosta and other members of the commission said part of the challenge will be getting employers to be active participants in the reskilling of the workforce and convincing workers in changing sectors like the service industry that careers in life sciences are not out of reach.<br/><br/>Other members of the commission noted the important role that public universities and community colleges can play in not just producing graduates with degrees, but properly training them for careers in growing fields through credential programs.<br/><br/>The report comes on the heels of another study done by the Special Legislative Early Education and Care Economic Review Commission that identified up to $1.5 billion in investments needed to increase salaries for early educators and make the child care system more affordable and accessible to families.<br/><br/>Senate President Karen Spilka said last week during a joint interview with House Speaker Ron Mariano that she would like to begin to address the state&#39;s child care needs this session, and Mariano suggested the House may start with some of the less costly improvements in its version of the annual state budget due out next month.<br/><br/>Gov. Charlie Baker also told the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce last week that he intends to file an economic development bill shortly that will include a request for more federal funding to help cities and towns adapt their downtowns to changing work and commuting patterns.<br/><br/>Baker said the Legislature approved some, but not all, of his funding requests to promote housing development and homeownership in last year&#39;s American Rescue Plan Act spending bill, but authorized none of his requested spending for downtown redevelopment.<br/><br/>One item recommended by the Future of Work Commission has already been adopted by the MBTA.<br/><br/>The panel embraced the idea of discounted flex passes on the commuter rail that will allow riders who commute less frequently to the office to maximize their travel budgets.<br/>",Matt Murphy | State House News Service,Tue Mar 29 19:10:13 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,"For pianist Jeremy Denk, music lessons are life lessons","For pianist Jeremy Denk, music lessons are life lessons","<i>Pianist Jeremy Denk recently released his first memoir, <a href=""https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/234672/every-good-boy-does-fine-by-jeremy-denk/"" target=""_blank"">“Every Good Boy Does Fine: A Love Story, in Music Lessons.”</a> Ahead of his performance of J.S. Bach’s Well-Tempered Clavier at GBH Calderwood Studio on April 2 and 3, part of the Celebrity Series of Boston, I caught up with the MacArthur “Genius” Fellow to discuss themes from his book, the musical pieces we take for granted and the challenges of writing about music.</i><br/><br/><b>James Bennett II:</b> Why do you feel compelled to tell your personal history through the medium of music? Apart from the fact that that is your profession and that&#39;s what you know, what advantages does that give you as a storyteller? <br/><br/><b>Jeremy Denk: </b>It&#39;s mostly the story of music lessons and all the amazing and difficult teachers that I had. And then I would say, secondarily, it&#39;s a story of me trying to survive as a person and trying to become a person. And I thought it was actually good for of comic relief — to see how incompetent I was at dealing with life while I was growing up — and also to frame the music. Because I feel It&#39;s important that we connect classical music to everyday life, to the sublime and the ridiculous. <br/><br/><b>Bennett:</b> You begin the book with a personal history of your family. Can you get into how that shaped who you became, as a musically inclined person?<br/><br/><b>Denk:</b> My father was a monk for 10 years — I was born a year after he left the monastery. His life story is complicated because he kept pursuing one thing or another and finding them unsatisfying. First it was science, and then it was religion. He ended up doing a lot of acting, also. He kept looking for something. And it seemed like that was really pertinent to the way that I thought about being a person who is growing up. <br/><br/>My mother loved music profoundly, you know, and listening to music was an important part of her. But both of them, of course, were terrified of the idea of me becoming a musician. And that was another huge theme for me growing up: trying to overcome doubt and their doubts, which manifested in my mind as they would. <br/><br/><b>Bennett:</b> One thing that you have in the text itself are these literal musical sketches, the images of the sheet music. Early on, there are two bits from your youth: “Ode to an Irish Grandmother” and “Rondo of an Exhausting Day.” Did you just have those scans lying around? And how much is your early work a part of you now? <br/><br/><b>Denk</b>: I still have my teacher&#39;s notebook from way back when, and I have, you know, a lot of documents of my high school and college papers I wrote. They&#39;re pretty hilarious in the sense of ridiculous overambition. Sweeping themes trying to address the great issues of life, and I was like 14 years old. I guess we held on to a lot of that and I tried to use it in the book to give a sense of what kind of person I was. And “Ode to an Irish Grandmother” was stolen from the theme from Star Wars, which I didn&#39;t realize until many years later. <br/><bsp-video data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1648756002488,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-e6b4-d0a5-a176-fef718960000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1648756002488,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-e6b4-d0a5-a176-fef718960000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;video&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017f-e183-d08d-a7ff-fbbf39c20001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a2f0008&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-e183-d541-adff-efa326ba0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a300000&quot;}"">Jeremy Denk composition</bsp-video><br/><b>Bennett:</b> Is it interesting to track your creative growth because you have access to all of these documents, musical and extra-musical? Or is it like, “That&#39;s kind of who I was, I&#39;m not really there anymore”? Is there value in revisiting your teenage and early-20s brain? <br/><br/><b>Denk</b>: I think the value is to see the process of gradual revelation, to trace the big moments when I really crossed over some hurdle or another. We see the sometimes accidental ways that we learn — the ways that we fail to learn for a long time, then suddenly something strikes us. The stratagems that teachers have to use to connect us with really important things. I guess for me, that was the value. It’s this beauty of the process of learning, which I would connect to the beauty of the way, sometimes, musical pieces unfold. <br/><br/><b>Bennett:</b> You’ve structured your book into three parts: Harmony, Melody and Rhythm. I’d argue that for the overwhelming majority of people, when they hear a new piece of music, the thing they’ll think about is the melody. Harmony, I guess, has implications of being a bit dense or complex or nerdy. And yet you start with that. Why that decision to first establish the “harmony” of lessons and musical examples and episodes from your earlier life, and not the other way around?<br/><br/><b>Denk:</b> As a pianist, we play so many notes, right? We&#39;re very attached to harmony. I made a little joke about that to a violist friend where I compared harmony and sex, and he&#39;s like, “That&#39;s such a pianist thing to say.” And it&#39;s true. Pianists really get off on big vats of harmony, and we love to feel the interaction between all the various voices, these incredible vertical things going on. <br/><br/>I guess my decision to order that way was partly because I thought the “harmony” chapters set a good tone at the beginning for talking about the very existence of a pianist. And partly because maybe my first love in so-called classical music was harmony. <br/><br/><b>Bennett:</b> You have these musical lessons placed throughout the book, including one for the Well-Tempered Clavier, specifically the Prelude in C Major from Book I. Walk me through what is so magnificent, so lasting — or, as you write, so stubborn — about that piece.<br/><br/><b>Denk:</b> Bach, from the very beginning of that piece, teaches us about what is possible in harmony, in a system of harmony that had only kind of recently congealed into a new form. I talk a lot about these seventh chords that have gradations of yearning in them. Throughout, he’s showing us the power and desire held within these chords, and the ability of music to create these incredible senses of tension and release. The distance from the Well-Tempered Clavier to the Hanon exercises is vast, even though they test the fingers as profoundly as any Hanon exercise would. Not to mention that Beethoven, Haydn, Mozart all studied these pieces when they were kids and then again later in life. So they had such a profound historical impact after that and in the whole unfolding of what we call classical music. <br/><br/><b>J.S.

How does that work into all this?<br/><br/><b>Denk:</b> I didn&#39;t really discover Nina Simone until I was into my 30s, which is embarrassing to say. I certainly knew of her incredible work before I saw the movie. It&#39;s an amazing moment, it sets loose all these emotions that have been hovering in the background. Nina Simone&#39;s performance has a sort of simplicity of the opening and then the incredible harmonic tension once she starts singing again. <br/><br/>In many ways she uses many of the same techniques that Bach uses, in the first preludes of the Well-Tempered Clavier. But she bends these classical harmony ideals to her own style and her own expressive intent. And I think that&#39;s such a model for what performers try to do in general. I&#39;ve spent enough time with Nina Simone, and I&#39;ve admired her artistry so much that I don&#39;t feel she&#39;s an odd person put [in discussing classical music] in any way. I&#39;ve often said she&#39;s one of the greatest pianists of the 20th century.

Article,"Chris Rock delivers at the Wilbur, stays quiet about Will Smith in first show since Oscars slap","Chris Rock delivers at the Wilbur, stays quiet about Will Smith in first show since Oscars slap","If there’s one thing Boston can&#39;t pass up on, it&#39;s drama.<br/><br/>That truth was crystal clear Wednesday night, when a sellout crowd stretched outside the Wilbur Theatre in downtown Boston to watch Chris Rock perform for the first time since Will Smith slapped him on live TV Sunday night at the Academy Awards ceremony. <br/><br/>The hit came after Rock made a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith’s bald head. Pinkett Smith, Smith&#39;s wife and an actress, has been very open about her struggles with hair loss due to alopecia.<br/><br/>The slap was the key to a pop culture Pandora’s Box that fell right at the intersection of discussions on violence, race, gender and the patriarchy — you know, all the topics Americans are comfortable talking about honestly and openly in a civil discourse. <br/><br/>Naturally, the pre-show scene outside the Wilbur was a carnival. Tickets had ballooned to hundreds and even thousands of dollars since Sunday night. Dozens of members of the press (GBH News included) hounded ticket-holders for their thoughts on the show. Members of the New Democracy Coalition used the buzz to stage a ready-made press conference to talk about violence in the Black community. <br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1648696502573,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-dc46-dd0e-abfa-fc7f12090000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1648696502573,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-dc46-dd0e-abfa-fc7f12090000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017f-d620-de45-afff-dfb57a8a0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017f-d32f-d191-a1ff-f32fde740000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-ddf7-df38-a17f-ddf795040008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017f-ddf7-df38-a17f-ddf792b70000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/><br/>Amid all the hype, one question floated like a heavy cloud: Would Chris Rock address the slap…or turn the other cheek?<br/><br/>Raven Campbell got her ticket to the show the morning after the Oscars. She thought for sure that Rock would say something.<br/><br/>“I feel like there’s no chance that he’s not going to address what happened at the Oscars,” she said.<br/><br/>That feeling was shared by pretty much everyone in line. But, as it turns out, Rock <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/chris-rock-readies-1st-show-smith-slapped-83770868"">didn’t have much to say</a> at all. Onstage, he mostly stuck to his set, saying he was still processing what happened. <br/><br/>But as the crowd trickled its way out of the Wilbur after the show, nobody was disappointed. <br/><br/>Corey Gorman came to the show from Quincy. He described a crowd that had Rock’s back after one of the most shocking awards show moments ever caught on camera. <br/><br/>“The tone of the crowd was so supportive,” he said. “There was a lot of, ‘I love you’ s’, ‘Hey, we support you.’ And honestly, he was a good comedian. He just left it to the comedy.”<br/><br/>The show of love reportedly led to Rock choking up on stage. Ali and Nick Novotny were sitting near the front and saw the comedian’s reaction to the crowd up close. <br/><br/>“He cried,” Nick said. “And (Ali) said, ‘Is it real tears?’ We was row, like, three. It was real tears.”<br/><br/>It was a human moment in a week where Chris Rock, Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith have been treated as anything but. <br/><br/>And for someone who was smack dab in the middle of one of the biggest messes Hollywood’s ever seen, Rock cleaned up pretty nicely by all accounts. <br/><br/>“He didn’t have to say anything about the ‘incident,” Nick Novotny said. <br/><br/>“No, he didn’t,” Ali agreed. “He is what he delivers.”",Esteban Bustillos,Thu Mar 31 06:03:11 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But communities often don&#39;t have the option of postponing projects.<br/><br/>&quot;Cities and towns have to rebuild their schools,&quot; he said. &quot;They have to try to figure out how to renovate the HVAC systems. And it&#39;s going to essentially consume more of their municipal budgets and resources.&quot;<br/><br/>While federal pandemic relief funding is helpful, he said, it also means cities are competing with each other for a limited number of contractors.<br/><br/>&quot;And so with essentially fewer contractors per bid, we expect that labor costs will also be going up, and the general cost of projects will be going up as well,&quot; Beckwith said.<br/><br/>To further complicate matters, Beckwith said it&#39;s becoming more expensive for cities and towns to borrow money for projects because the Federal Reserve is increasing interest rates.<br/><br/>&quot;As communities go out to borrow money to pay for these expensive construction projects and then retire that debt over 20 or 25 years, the interest rate that they will have to pay will be going up because the Fed is increasing interest rates,&quot; Beckwith said. &quot;So it appears to be a very challenging time for likely a number of years for municipalities.&quot; <br/><br/>Beckwith said the impact will be a reduction in the size of projects across the state.<br/><br/>&quot;Ultimately, it just means very careful management and likely scaling back the magnitude of some of the projects, while still paying more money,&quot; he said. &quot;So it&#39;s not a good news story for municipal finances going forward.&quot;",Craig LeMoult,Thu Mar 31 17:35:42 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,The historic significance of the confirmation vote for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson,The historic significance of the confirmation vote for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson,"No matter the final tally, today’s vote by members of the Senate Judiciary Committee will be historic. The senators are set to vote on whether to recommend Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first African-American woman nominated to the Supreme Court, to the full Senate for confirmation. <br/><br/>Most of the Republican committee members, who took part in the March hearings, plan to be on the wrong side of history. Even Republican Sen. Ben Sasse — who described some of his GOP colleagues’ antics as “jackassery&quot; — has said he won’t support her. The Nebraska Republican acknowledged Judge Brown Jackson as “an extraordinary person” but added, “We both love this country, but we disagree on judicial philosophy.” Sadly, most of his colleagues on the committee will also vote no. Sen. Lindsay Graham already announced he would vote no, even though he supported her two previous confirmations.

Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn insisted that she define “woman.” And in a red-faced fit of pomposity, Sen. Ted Cruz, who first met the judge when they were both Harvard Law School students, demanded to know if she thought babies were “racist.” He challenged the curriculum at the private school where she is a board member for teaching Dr. Ibram X.

I kept thinking about those Black church elders who often reminded me, ‘There’s no testimony without a test.’ As a Black woman, she’s had a lifetime of testing, having to navigate racist assumptions about her intelligence and abilities.<br/><br/>I sobbed when Sen. Cory Booker used his time to call out the race and gender attacks and to recognize her stellar accomplishments, saying “God has got you. And how do I know that? Because you’re here. And I know what it’s taken for you to sit in that seat.”<br/><br/>As it happens, an accident of history adds to the weight of today’s vote. On April 4, 54 years ago, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. Judge Brown Jackson is one of the children of the dreamers who fought racial segregation, imagining a future where she could ascend to the Supreme Court. <br/><br/>She’ll have at least one Republican vote for confirmation in the full Senate: Maine’s Susan Collins pledged her support.<br/><br/>It’s possible that by week’s end, Judge Brown Jackson will be the third Black justice and the sixth woman ever to serve on the high court, testimony in hand.",Callie Crossley,Mon Apr 04 05:00:20 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,Sibling adoption bill goes to Baker’s desk,Sibling adoption bill goes to Baker’s desk,"The Legislature sent Gov. Charlie Baker a bill Monday that allows adults to adopt their younger siblings, a policy change supporters say would create a wider range of permanent living arrangements for children.<br/><br/>The bill, co-sponsored by Sen. Joan Lovely (D-Salem) and Rep. Jack Patrick Lewis (D-Framingham), removes a section of state law preventing adults from adopting their younger siblings, aunts, or uncles and updates current language to ensure an adoptee&#39;s right to inheritance from their natural parents or kin.<br/><br/>The state allows adults to enter into a guardianship status with their younger siblings, aunts, or uncles, but advocates say adoption provides adoptees with a stronger feeling of permanency.

And he masterfully used both tools well,&quot; Curry said. &quot;One particular thing marked his leadership. He let you fall down. He let you make mistakes. But he always picked you up. He had this leadership style that said, &#39;Hey, I want you to learn how to do this stuff. I want you to figure it out as you go, and I always got your back.&#39;&quot;<br/><br/>Alkins began working for the state Senate in 1962, according to a biography written when he was honored with the Boston Branch&#39;s Distinguished Service Award in 2008.<br/><br/>The Brockton resident went on to serve as an aide to the Senate majority leader (1965-1970), legislative assistant and administrative assistant to Senate President Kevin Harrington (1971-1978), and clerk of the Committees on Rules of the two branches until 2002. Alkins was elected president of the NAACP Boston Branch in 1995.<br/><br/>One hallmark of his tenure was the Knock Across Boston campaign led by the Boston Branch in 2000, according to the biography -- a &quot;persuasive, door-to-door voter education and registration campaign&quot; which &quot;contributed to record voter participation in communities of color.&quot;<br/><br/>He also served on the NAACP&#39;s National Resolutions Committee, the Sovereign Bank Community Advisory Group, and as chairman of the NAACP New England Area Conference&#39;s Labor and Industry Committee.<br/><br/>An <a href=""https://floydawilliamsfuneralhome.com/tribute/details/801/Leonard-Alkins/obituary.html#content-start"" target=""_blank"">obituary</a> for Alkins featuring a poem by Johnny Ray Ryder Jr. was posted to the website for the Floyd A. Williams Funeral Home in Dorchester.<br/><br/>Presidents of local NAACP branches serve in the role on a volunteer basis, often while they hold another job and tend to their families. It&#39;s life or death work, Curry said, and the position can demand a lot from a person.<br/><br/>Having served as president of the Boston branch for six years, Curry said he knows what it takes to hold the title. And Alkins, he said, was a master of his craft -- all the while raising his two kids with his wife Carole Alkins.<br/><br/>&quot;The average lifespan of an NAACP president is probably three to four years because most people don&#39;t have the capacity to give so much of their time and energy to this work because it&#39;s draining, right. It&#39;s very serious life or death work,&quot; Curry said. &quot;[Alkins] did this for over a decade, which is just phenomenal when you think about anybody leading an organization for over a decade as a volunteer with no pay.&quot;<br/><br/>NAACP Boston Branch President Tanisha Sullivan said Alkins will be remembered for the work he did to advance civil rights throughout Greater Boston and his lifetime of fighting to protect democracy.<br/><br/>&quot;His was a labor of unwavering love, reflective hope and selfless service,&quot; Sullivan said in a statement to the News Service. &quot;His commitment to mentoring and encouraging the next generation of civil rights leaders is unmatched, and as a result his hope, love and fight live on in and through each of us.&quot;","Chris Van Buskirk, Sam Doran | State House News Service",Tue Apr 12 10:04:05 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the coronavirus pandemic disrupted his routine, he has been drawing portraits in the Common just about every day since last May. His popularity has only increased the past few months after passersby started sharing his work on TikTok, dubbing him the &quot;$1 Portrait Guy.&quot;<br/><br/>Shea said he appreciates how his art has organically reached more people. <br/><br/>“People have been telling me they come out to find me, like, I’m the reason that they’re entering the Boston Common. I think it’s awesome because it gets people outside,” said Shea. <br/><br/>After Shea sets up his signature cardboard sign next to a Common bench,<b> </b>a line quickly takes shape along the sidewalk.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1650654622724,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-a207-d936-a37f-e2ef772a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1650654622724,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-a207-d936-a37f-e2ef772a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;Related Stories&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-4c7a-d69c-ade1-fc7bb5890003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-51dd-d3f4-a1dc-dbffa2590003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-431b-dfa2-a5cd-c73bb1090003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-52aa-dfd5-adbf-deaae2870004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-52aa-dfd5-adbf-deaae1860000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>“I try not to look at the lines. I try to focus on who I’m drawing, but it can be very busy out here,” said Shea. “Even in previous years, there were days where there’s lines. I’ve had days where I’ve had zero people, I feel like I’ve run the whole gamut. It’s been a bit of an adjustment in the sense that I’ve been kept very busy [consistently].”<br/><br/>Even after drawing for hours, sometimes finishing an entire 100-pack of index cards, Shea said he makes it a point to give everyone a positive experience. <br/><br/>“I treat everybody the same, whether they’re 5 months old or 78, I meet people where they’re at. Everyone’s trying to have the same positive experience as everybody else,” said Shea. “I&#39;ve been really grateful for the widespread people coming to the park, reaching out to me on social media, and people all over the world.”<br/><br/>Shea said over the years, there have been days where he&#39;s gotten zero people, but he says even on a day where he only draws one person, it&#39;s worth it.<br/><br/>Drawing isn’t the only artform Shea is passionate about. He also makes music, and he said he loves meeting people in the Common who later connect with him on social media and interact with his music. What started out as a fun way to meet people has turned into more for Shea.<br/><br/>“I’ve been through a lot, so for me to spend some time enjoying my day, or having that intention, it’s really important to me,” said Shea.<br/><br/>For Shea, his art is a way to express himself and put positive energy into the world, and he encourages others to do the same. <br/><br/>“I don’t want to try and sound too inspirational, but if there were people listening right now, I would say, ‘Don’t be afraid to do something.’ A lot of people say ‘Live in the moment,’ which is true, but think about where these moments are leading to. You have a bunch of positive moments, there’s a positive future. If there’s a bunch of negative things, there might be a negative future,&quot; he said. &quot;You want to take it step by step — one drawing at a time — and try to make a positive world.” ",Grace Laverriere,Fri Apr 22 17:13:36 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,Beverly assisted living facility gives residents 90 days notice to find new homes,Beverly assisted living facility gives residents 90 days notice to find new homes,"The operator of an assisted living facility in downtown Beverly this week sent a letter to its 62 residents, notifying them that they will have to move out within 90 days. <br/><br/>Maryland-based Monarch Communities, which took over the Landmark Senior Living facility in December 2021 and renamed it Motif by Monarch, said they have to close down for a year to make essential repairs and renovations. The company said it is offering residents resources to find new homes. Still, advocates are worried that residents may face limited options and higher bills given the 90-day notice, the minimum required under state regulation.<br/><br/>Monarch Communities managing partner Ross Dingman said the company wishes it did not have to shut down, but the extent of problems has escalated.<br/><br/>“As an operator, it&#39;s unacceptable to have generators fail, elevators fail, heating and air conditioning fail and not have confidence in them working,” Dingman said. “We have fixed them in the short term. But what really needs to happen is we need to have a long-term system upgrade so we can feel confident the residents going forward will be safe.”<br/><br/>He also said they found considerable water damage coming from the roof down to the first floor of the multistory building, which dates back to the late 19th century.<br/><br/>&quot;The building is old,&quot; said Barbara Packard, who moved into the facility just months ago after living in Cambridge. &quot;I thought it was handled very nicely.&quot;<br/><br/>Packard said she plans to walk around Beverly to look for a new place to live.

Jerry Parisella, who represents Beverly, said he first heard about the facility closing when he got an email from the granddaughter of a 99-year-old resident.<br/><br/>“So obviously, there was a lot of concern for somebody 99 years old,” Parisells said, “a lot of concern from those folks about, ‘how can we find adequate housing within 90 days?’”<br/><br/>Parisella said one of the biggest worries is residents in the Beverly facility who pay for assisted living through the state’s Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly, or PACE, which is administered by MassHealth and Medicare. <br/><br/>“It&#39;s unfortunate that it seems to be that a lot of facilities prefer the private pay and a lot of our most vulnerable residents can&#39;t afford that,” said Parisella. “And these family members [of Beverly residents] are being told even some of the facilities that they&#39;re checking out, that they may have to pay $800 to $1,300 a month more for their family members, and that&#39;s just not doable for a lot of people.”<br/><br/>Dingman said they couldn&#39;t commit to accepting residents under PACE when they reopen until they know what rates they can negotiate. <br/><br/>The Massachusetts Executive Office of Elder Affairs confirmed that Monarch notified the agency of its intent to temporarily close the Beverly facility within 90 days of July 19, pending the successful relocation of all current residents. Dingman said Monarch recognizes that timeline is &quot;not great.&quot; <br/><br/>&quot;I feel like we&#39;re doing the best we can and giving resources where we can to make sure that everyone gets placement in a home that&#39;s appropriate for them,&quot; he said.<br/><br/>One reason giving more than the regulatory 90 days notice is difficult for Monarch, Dingman said, is their ability to retain enough staff temporarily until the facility can close.<br/><br/>“We recognize it&#39;s very upsetting for people,” Dingman said. “We have never done this before. I&#39;ve been in this business for decades. This is a first for us. We don&#39;t like doing it. It&#39;s terrible for our reputation. But at the end of the day, we feel like it is a safety concern.”<br/><br/>Still Parisella said he’s concerned about the length of notice given by Monarch.<br/><br/>“They met the letter of the law,” Parisella said, “but I think that&#39;s something that we as legislators, there may be something we need to look at and just see if more notice should be required.”<br/><br/><i><a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/people/annie-shreffler"">Annie Shreffler</a> contributed reporting.</i>",Mark Herz,Fri Apr 22 18:05:03 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,Union wins two elections among clinical staff at McLean Hospital,Union wins two elections among clinical staff at McLean Hospital,"Local union organizers have scored another victory at McLean Hospital in Belmont, after winning two votes on Friday to unionize all hourly clinical staff like nurses and mental health specialists who assist with patient care.<br/><br/>In September, research assistants at the nationally prominent Harvard-affiliated psychiatric treatment and research institution <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2021/09/27/prestige-doesnt-pay-the-bills-mclean-hospital-research-assistants-form-union"">formed a union</a> — the first, the organizers say, in the hospital’s long history.<br/><br/>All hourly clinical staff, excluding those with advanced degrees, will be part of the union if Friday&#39;s votes are confirmed. Through the effort, union organizers from AFSCME Council 93, which represents some 45,000 mostly state and municipal workers in New England, said about one-third of McLean’s approximately 2,400 employees may soon be unionized. The union said support staff such as janitorial, maintenance, culinary and security employees are not unionized at McLean.<br/><br/>Leah Cohen is a former research assistant at the hospital, who is now an organizer with AFSCME Council 93. She said low pay and a general feeling of disrespect toward employees drove the effort to unionize 145 research assistants last year, and the votes on Friday to unionize over 600 other workers.<br/><br/>“It is one of, if not the most, famous psychiatric hospitals in the world,” Cohen said, “and so you just would think, hope, pray that they would treat their employees well. … And so I think definitely realizing that that wasn&#39;t true, realizing that hypocrisy and then being able to actually do something about it is like the best thing in the world.”<br/><br/>Two groups of McLean employees voted in the union elections on Friday. One group consisted of registered nurses, nurse practitioners and registered clinical coordinators, who voted 113-100 in favor of unionizing. The other group consisted of mental health specialists and community residence counselors, who voted 121-91 in favor. Both vote tallies are preliminary, unofficial results reported by both the union and hospital. <br/><br/>McLean has challenged dozens of the ballots from Friday&#39;s elections on technical grounds, and the National Labor Relations Board will have to rule on those challenges. The union said they are confident the results will hold up.

(AP) — A man who voted in both New Hampshire and Massachusetts in the 2016 general election has been ordered to pay nearly $5,000 in fines and penalties.<br/><br/>Todd Krysiak, 39, was charged in June 2019 and pleaded guilty Friday to voting in more than one state. He was given a 90-day suspended sentence and ordered to pay a $4,000 fine, plus a $960 penalty. According to prosecutors, he cast ballots in both Alton, New Hampshire, and Leominster, Massachusetts, on Nov. 6, 2016.<br/><br/>Krysiak was registered as a Republican in Alton, according to the 2016 voter checklist. Attorney David Bodanza said Monday that his client voted in Alton, where he lives, and later in the day visited his mother in Massachusetts. She told him his name was on the list of registered voters in her town, where he had previously lived, so he voted there, as well.<br/><br/>“He went down to vote, thinking that he could,” he said.<br/><br/>Bodanza called the plea a fair resolution, but said the case raised unanswered questions about whether Krysiak acted knowingly in regards to each element of the crime.

But the group says its audit didn&#39;t include those events unless they “featured slogans or signs that directly linked their opposition to Israel or Zionism to all Jews or incorporated antisemitic tropes.”<br/><br/>The audit found that extremists groups or individuals, including white supremacists, were responsible for 484 incidents last year, up from 332 in 2020.

Keith Motley, chancellor emeritus of UMass Boston, said Owens used to give an eight-word lesson: Lead, follow or get out of the way. <br/><br/>“And what he was trying to tell us was, ‘Do something,’&quot; he said. “He kept us in check. … All the way back there in the ‘70s, he was talking to us about reparations. And it wasn’t about no 20 acres and a mule, it was about preparing us to be chancellor of an institution and understanding it didn’t matter what they called you, it mattered what you did. Your work will speak for you.”<br/><br/>Among Owens&#39; many accomplishments was his pivotal work in the development of Roxbury Community College and his creation of the State Office of Minority and Women Business Assistance. In 1989, he filed legislation seeking reparations for the descendants of enslaved Black Americans.<br/><br/>Speaking remotely, Sen. Ed Markey, who was a state representative alongside Owens, said the path Owens paved will act as a shining beacon for years to come. <br/><br/>“Bill’s presence grounded me in the realities of today’s struggles,” Markey said. “And his spirit lifted my gaze and countless others to the opportunities and the justice that we must continue to pursue for all future generations.”<br/><br/>Among those who Owens inspired was Rep. Ayanna Pressley, who also spoke remotely at the memorial. <br/><br/>“I don’t think that it is an overstatement to say that I would not have been a city councilor, I would not be a member of Congress and the many other historic firsts that we have seen in recent years as the political landscape of the city of Boston and indeed our commonwealth has shifted to become more representative. That has everything to do with the enduring legacy of Sen. Owens,” she said. “We thank him for blazing that trail and for making the road just a little bit easier.”<br/><br/>Owens’ work also had an impact on Boston Mayor Michelle Wu.<br/><br/>She recalled how even though he supported Kim Janey during Boston’s recent mayoral race, Owens took time to ask Wu how she and her family were doing. <br/><br/>“He has fought fiercely for our community because he fights for each and every one of us as human beings and people first and foremost,” she said. <br/><br/>Wu said that she is grateful to be a part of a modern generation of local progressive leaders that she said knows are only here because of Owens. <br/><br/>“Sen. Owens trained us to cast our eyes to the horizon and fight for every step of the way to get there,” she said. “We continue that fight today and we continue to lift up his legacy. Rise in power, Sen. Bill Owens.”",Esteban Bustillos,Wed Apr 27 09:24:30 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

<p>The first message sent by Morse code’s dots and dashes across a long distance traveled from Washington, D.C., to Baltimore on Friday, May 24, 1844 – 175 years ago. It signaled the first time in human history that complex thoughts could be communicated at long distances almost instantaneously. <a href=""https://prezi.com/9puvdbvqudzy/early-methods-of-long-distance-communication/"">Until then</a>, people had to have face-to-face conversations; send coded messages <a href=""https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-talking-drums-29197334/"">through drums</a>, <a href=""https://adventure.howstuffworks.com/survival/wilderness/how-to-send-smoke-signal.htm"">smoke signals</a> and <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22909590"">semaphore systems</a>; or read printed words.</p>

<p>Thanks to Samuel F.B. Morse, communication changed rapidly, and has been changing ever faster since. He invented the electric telegraph in 1832. It took six more years for him to standardize a code for communicating over telegraph wires. In 1843, <a href=""https://www.thedailystar.com/opinion/columns/samuel-morse-s-telegraph-plans-perfected-in-cherry-valley/article_1ceb7424-a97a-5d70-b6c8-82045d04043a.html"">Congress gave him US$30,000</a> to string wires between the nation’s capital and nearby Baltimore. When the line was completed, he conducted a public demonstration of long-distance communication.</p>

<p>Morse wasn’t the only one working to develop a means of <a href=""https://taskandpurpose.com/the-jolt-of-electricity-that-forever-altered-war"">communicating over the telegraph</a>, but his is the one that has survived. The wires, magnets and keys used in the initial demonstration have given way to smartphones’ on-screen keyboards, but Morse code has remained fundamentally the same, and is still – perhaps surprisingly – relevant in the 21st century. Although I have learned, and relearned, it many times as a Boy Scout, an amateur radio operator and a pilot, I continue to admire it and strive to master it.</p>


<h2>Easy sending</h2>

<p>Morse’s key insight in constructing the code was considering how frequently each letter is used in English. The most commonly used letters have shorter symbols: “E,” which appears most often, is signified by a single “dot.” By contrast, “Z,” the <a href=""https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/explore/which-letters-are-used-most"">least used letter</a> in English, was signified by the much longer and more complex “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Morse_code"">dot-dot-dot (pause) dot</a>.” </p>

<p>In 1865, the International Telecommunications Union <a href=""https://www.itu.int/en/history/Pages/ITUBorn1865.aspx"">changed the code</a> to account for different character frequencies in other languages. There have been other tweaks since, but “E” is still “dot,” though “Z” is now “<a href=""https://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/m/R-REC-M.1677-1-200910-I!!PDF-E.pdf#page=4"">dash-dash-dot-dot</a>.”</p>

<p>The reference to letter frequency makes for extremely efficient communications: Simple words with common letters can be transmitted very quickly. Longer words can still be sent, but they take more time.</p>


<h2>Going wireless</h2>

<p>The communications system that Morse code was designed for – analogue connections over metal wires that carried a lot of interference and needed a clear on-off type signal to be heard – has evolved significantly.</p>

<p>The first big change came just a few decades after Morse’s demonstration. In the late 19th century, Guglielmo Marconi invented <a href=""https://www.history.com/topics/inventions/guglielmo-marconi"">radio-telegraph equipment</a>, which could send Morse code over radio waves, rather than wires.</p>

<p>The shipping industry loved this new way to communicate with ships at sea, either from ship to ship or to shore-based stations. By 1910, U.S. law <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Ship_Act_of_1910"">required many passenger ships in U.S. waters</a> to carry wireless sets for sending and receiving messages. </p>

<p>After the Titanic sank in 1912, an international agreement required some ships to assign a person to <a href=""https://www.itu.int/itunews/manager/display.asp?lang=en&amp;year=2006&amp;issue=06&amp;ipage=pioneers&amp;ext=html"">listen for radio distress signals</a> at all times. That same agreement designated “SOS” – “<a href=""https://www.itu.int/itunews/manager/display.asp?lang=en&amp;year=2006&amp;issue=06&amp;ipage=pioneers&amp;ext=html"">dot-dot-dot dash-dash-dash dot-dot-dot</a>” – as the international distress signal, not as an abbreviation for anything but because it was a <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17631595"">simple pattern</a> that was easy to remember and transmit. The <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/02/us/coast-guard-signs-off-on-morse-code-and-an-era-at-sea-ends.html"">Coast Guard discontinued monitoring</a> in 1995. The requirement that ships monitor for distress signals was <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-aug-16-mn-13607-story.html"">removed in 1999</a>, though the U.S. Navy still teaches at least some <a href=""https://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=92864"">sailors to read, send and receive Morse code</a>.</p>

<p>Aviators also use Morse code to identify automated navigational aids. These are radio beacons that help pilots follow routes, traveling from one transmitter to the next on aeronautical charts. They <a href=""https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2012/august/31/ifr-fix-how-is-your-morse-code"">transmit their identifiers</a> – such as “BAL” for Baltimore – in Morse code. Pilots often learn to recognize familiar-sounding patterns of beacons in areas they fly frequently.</p>

<p>There is a <a href=""https://www.fistsna.org/"">thriving community</a> of amateur radio operators who treasure Morse code, too. Among amateur radio operators, Morse code is a cherished tradition tracing back to the earliest days of radio. Some of them may have begun in the Boy Scouts, which has made learning Morse variably <a href=""https://observer.wunderwood.org/2016/02/22/history-of-morse-code-in-the-bsa/"">optional or required</a> over the years. The Federal Communications Commission used to require all licensed amateur radio operators to demonstrate proficiency in Morse code, but that <a href=""https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-modifies-amateur-radio-service-rules-eliminating-morse-code-exam"">ended in 2007</a>.  The FCC does still issue <a href=""https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/bureau-divisions/mobility-division/commercial-radio-operator-license-program/commercial-0"">commercial licenses that require Morse</a> proficiency, but no jobs require it anymore.</p>

<h2>Blinking Morse</h2>

<p>Because its signals are so simple – on or off, long or short – Morse code can also be used by flashing lights. Many navies around the world use blinker lights to communicate from ship to ship when they don’t want to use radios or when radio equipment breaks down. The U.S. Navy is actually testing a system that would let a user <a href=""https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/navy-ships/a27391/us-navy-morse-code-software/"">type words and convert it to blinker light</a>. A receiver would read the flashes and convert it back to text.</p>

<p>Skills learned in the military <a href=""https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4120186/Army-veteran-54-crawled-rocky-beach-two-hours-breaking-leg-saved-exchanging-Morse-code-signals-wife-using-TORCH.html"">helped an injured man communicate</a> with his wife across a rocky beach using only his flashlight in 2017.</p>

<h2>Other Morse messages</h2>

<p>Perhaps the most notable modern use of Morse code was by <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2014-mar-29-la-me-jeremiah-denton-20140329-story.html"">Navy pilot Jeremiah Denton</a>, while he was a prisoner of war in Vietnam. In 1966, about one year into a nearly eight-year imprisonment, Denton was forced by his North Vietnamese captors to participate in a video interview about his treatment. While the camera focused on his face, he blinked the Morse code symbols for “torture,” <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/29/us/politics/jeremiah-a-denton-jr-war-hero-and-senator-dies-at-89.html"">confirming for the first time</a> U.S. fears about the treatment of service members held captive in North Vietnam.</p>

A number of devices – including <a href=""https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/gboard-ios-morse-code-mode/"">iPhones and Android</a> smartphones – can be set up to accept Morse code input from people with limited motor skills.</p>

<p>There are still many ways people can <a href=""https://morsedx.com/"">learn Morse code</a>, and <a href=""https://cwops.org/cw-academy-2/"">practice</a> using it, even online. In emergency situations, it can be the only mode of communications that will get through. Beyond that, there is an art to Morse code, a rhythmic, musical fluidity to the sound. Sending and receiving it can have a soothing or meditative feeling, too, as the person focuses on the flow of individual characters, words and sentences. Overall, sometimes the simplest tool is all that’s needed to accomplish the task.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

Article,Boston breaks ground on MLK and Coretta Scott King memorial to celebrate civil rights and 'Black love',Boston breaks ground on MLK and Coretta Scott King memorial to celebrate civil rights and 'Black love',"The nonprofit King Boston on Wednesday broke ground on the Boston Common for an imposing new memorial to Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King. Helping to ceremonially start digging into what was called &quot;hallowed ground&quot; were Gov. Charlie Baker, Boston City Mayor Michelle Wu and Massachusetts U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins, the first Black woman to hold that job.<br/><br/>The planned sculpture will be a celebration of the civil rights movement as well as the Kings&#39; love for each other, located in the city where the couple first met in the early 1950s. At that time, she was studying at the New England Conservatory of Music and he was a graduate student in Theology at Boston University. The 20 foot-high, multi-ton bronze sculpture of the Kings&#39; four intertwined arms — called &quot;The Embrace&quot; — is inspired by a photo of them embracing when Martin Luther King Jr. learned he had won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964.<br/><br/>Former state Rep. Marie St. Fleur, the first Haitian American to hold state office in the United States, highlighted that the groundbreaking fell on what would have been Coretta Scott King’s 95th birthday.<br/><br/>“This is so wonderful that we&#39;re celebrating on the birthday of this woman, this woman who really taught us about love,” St. Fleur said, “love for her husband, love for her family, love for community, the kind of love that we don&#39;t talk about anymore. Love that requires sacrifice … love that requires to put some work into it. … And we must continue to push that flame forward. And this embrace is going to remind us of that.”<br/><br/>“The Embrace” will be one of the country’s largest memorials dedicated to racial equity when installation is complete in October, and the first new memorial on Boston Common in over a century, according to King Boston, the nonprofit formed to fund and erect the $9.5 million sculpture.<br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651101514998,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651101514998,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-6d50-d69c-ade1-fd59b8780001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-6d50-d69c-ade1-fd59a75a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-6d50-d69c-ade1-fd59a73e0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">A line of people hold golden shovels next to a large pile of dirt.</bsp-image><br/>King Boston is also forming its own Center for Economic Justice, which will research and evaluate policies that address racial equity in such areas as wealth, housing and public education.

Article,"Massachusetts' economy loses $2.7 billion due to child care problems every year, new report finds","Massachusetts' economy loses $2.7 billion due to child care problems every year, new report finds","Massachusetts’ economy is losing an estimated $2.7 billion every year because working families can’t afford or find child care, according to a report released on Thursday by the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation.<br/><br/>A little over 60% of that money comes in the form of lost wages by parents who aren’t going to work, and 30% of it comes in the form of money lost by employers in lower productivity and turnover costs.

He added that many of his workers are reentering the workforce, so they’re not taking them away from competing providers.<br/><br/>“We’re giving $2,000 incentives to join us, and we&#39;ve increased our salaries by over 30% in the last couple of years,” Madaus said. “We still need to hire more people, so, we’re doing everything we can to bring folks in.”<br/><br/>But Eddy said the state’s child-care subsidy program for families is not reaching the majority of people who need it most. He pointed to a <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-SjLTTCJ6WTbCMHhgLuVV3WkmVh1DZas/view"">report published by the state last month</a>, which found that just 17% of families who qualify for subsidies are currently receiving them. <br/><br/>“That is right, in a nutshell, the problem we have right now,” Eddy said. “Some families are paying an extraordinary amount of their income for child care because they couldn&#39;t access a subsidy. They just couldn’t either navigate the system, or couldn&#39;t find a voucher — or providers in their area just weren&#39;t offering a voucher, because they have no staff and have closed classrooms.” <br/><br/>Madaus and Eddy both said they’re encouraged by the recently released House budget <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2022/04/11/house-plans-110-million-investment-in-early-childhood-ed-and-care"" target=""_blank"">that allocates $110 million towards early education and care</a>.

Article,State report says ex-leader of Holyoke Soldiers' Home lacked leadership capacity,State report says ex-leader of Holyoke Soldiers' Home lacked leadership capacity,"The leader of a veterans&#39; care center in Massachusetts where 76 veterans died after testing positive for the coronavirus in the spring of 2020 lacked both the leadership skills and the temperament to run such a facility when he was hired in 2016, according to a blistering state Inspector General&#39;s report released Friday.<br/><br/>The 91-page report, which covers the period from May 2016 until February 2020 — just before the pandemic struck with full force — was also highly critical of the process that led to the hiring of Bennett Walsh as superintendent of the Holyoke Soldiers&#39; Home and of state oversight of the home.<br/><br/>The investigation that led to the report started in 2019 in response to pre-pandemic complaints about Walsh.<br/><br/>“Superintendent Walsh did not have and did not develop the leadership capacity or temperament for the role of superintendent,” an executive summary of the report said. “He created an unprofessional and negative work environment, retaliated against employees he deemed disloyal, demonstrated a lack of engagement in the home’s operations and circumvented his chain of command.”<br/><br/>Walsh was also frequently absent during regular business hours and staff did not always know where he was.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651258301913,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651258301913,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017f-6f5c-d83b-a97f-7f5cbc0c0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-49e8-d269-a3fd-fffb4b530003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000172-e6c3-d47b-a1f2-f6cf2b710003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-76a8-dfd5-adbf-feaa89e20001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-76a8-dfd5-adbf-feaa88e40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>The report acknowledges that Walsh inherited some problems with the home when he was appointed by Gov.

Article,Your dog's personality may have little to do with its breed,Your dog's personality may have little to do with its breed,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Research confirms what dog lovers know — every pup is truly an individual.<br/><br/>Many of the popular stereotypes about the behavior of golden retrievers, poodles or schnauzers, for example, aren&#39;t supported by science, according to a new study.<br/>&quot;There is a huge amount of behavioral variation in every breed, and at the end of the day, every dog really is an individual,&quot; said study co-author and University of Massachusetts geneticist Elinor Karlsson.<br/><br/>She said pet owners love to talk about their dog&#39;s personality, as illustrated by some owners at a New York dog park.<br/><br/>Elizabeth Kelly said her English springer spaniel was &quot;friendly, but she&#39;s also kind of the queen bee.&quot; Suly Ortiz described her yellow Lab as &quot;really calm, lazy and shy.&quot;<br/><br/>And Rachel Kim&#39;s mixed-breed dog is &quot;a lot of different dogs, personality wise — super independent, really affectionate with me and my husband, but pretty, pretty suspicious of other people, other dogs.&quot;<br/><br/>That kind of enthusiasm from pet owners inspired Karlsson&#39;s latest scientific inquiry. She wanted to know to what extent are behavioral patterns inherited — and how much are dog breeds associated with distinctive and predictable behaviors?<br/><br/>The answer: While physical traits such as a greyhound&#39;s long legs or a Dalmatian&#39;s spots are clearly inherited, breed is not a strong predictor of any individual dog&#39;s personality.<br/>The researchers&#39; work, published Thursday in the journal Science, marshals a massive dataset to reach these conclusions — the most ever compiled, said Adam Boyko, a geneticist at Cornell University, who was not involved in the study.<br/><br/>Dogs became humanity&#39;s best friend more than 14,000 years ago, as the only animal domesticated before the advent of agriculture.<br/><br/>But the concept of dog breeds is much more recent. Around 160 years ago, people began to selectively breed dogs to have certain consistent physical traits, like coat texture and color and ear shape.<br/><br/>The researchers surveyed more than 18,000 dog owners and analyzed the genomes of about 2,150 of their dogs to look for patterns.<br/><br/>They found that some behaviors — such as howling, pointing and showing friendliness to human strangers —do have at least some genetic basis. But that inheritance isn&#39;t strictly passed down along breed lines.<br/><br/>For example, they found golden retrievers that don&#39;t retrieve, said co-author Kathryn Lord, who studies animal behavior with Karlsson.<br/><br/>Some breeds, such as huskies and beagles, may show a greater tendency to howl. But many of these dogs don&#39;t, as both the owner survey and genetic data showed.<br/><br/>The researchers could find no genetic basis for aggressive behaviors nor a link to specific breeds.<br/><br/>&quot;The correlation between dog behavior and dog breed is much lower than most expected,&quot; said Jeff Kidd, a geneticist at the University of Michigan, who had no role in the research.<br/>___<br/>AP reporter Emma H.

Article,Suffolk DA dedicates funds to relocate homeless population at Mass. and Cass,Suffolk DA dedicates funds to relocate homeless population at Mass. and Cass,"Suffolk County District Attorney Kevin Hayden’s office is allocating $400,000 toward a program that hopes to provide an alternative to prosecution for those struggling with homelessness and substance use disorder at the Boston intersection of Melnea Cass Boulevard and Mass. Ave, known as Mass. and Cass.<br/><br/>“Along with substance abuse use disorder, we see mental health issues, homelessness, joblessness and numerous other factors,” Hayden said at a news conference Monday. “It would be very easy for us to say, let&#39;s just get these people out of here. But the correct approach is to say, let&#39;s give these people a way out of here.” <br/><br/>In anticipation of an increase in the area’s population during the summer months, funds from the DA’s Asset Forfeiture Fund will be used to expand Services Over Sentences (SOS), a program started last year in partnership with the North Suffolk Mental Health Association. <br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651524892349,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651524892349,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-868d-d812-adfa-9e9f09080001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-868c-dfd5-adbf-9eaede2d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-868c-dfd5-adbf-9eaeddf50000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">IMG_0602.jpg</bsp-image><br/>“It’s clear that traditional court involvement is not the answer for many of the vulnerable individuals in the center or fringes of Mass. and Cass,” Hayden said. “We need to present alternative solutions that identify and address the issues that brought them there in the first place. I’m confident this program does that, and I think money seized from drug-related convictions is a fitting method to fund it.” <br/><br/>With a tentative launch date of June 2, the funding will cover one year of services for 30 individuals, primarily but not exclusively focusing on those living in and around Mass. and Cass. Depending on specific needs, individuals will be placed in sober housing, intensive rehabilitation and detox programs. The program will be voluntary, and those who are accepted will be placed in programs around the state under the condition of sobriety, said Audrey Clairmont, the director of addiction services at North Suffolk Mental Health. <br/><br/>Those who are not ready to commit to sobriety or detox “will be weeded out because they have to opt in to this program,” Clairmont said, “and there will be full transparency about what the goals of this program are. The goal is recovery.” <br/><br/>The program will have the capacity to work with 30 people at one time, Clairmont said, though she anticipates that more will be served as people pass in and out of recovery. Hayden described the program as “one piece of the puzzle” working in tandem with programs led by the City of Boston and local nonprofits. <br/><br/>“We have hundreds of people on the street down at Mass. and Cass, and many of them need help,” Newmarket Business Association Executive Director Sue Sullivan said. “This program will allow the DA’s office and the police to give an option for all those who are arrested for crimes that are not violent.

Article,Boston protesters rally against Supreme Court opinion to strike down Roe v. Wade,Boston protesters rally against Supreme Court opinion to strike down Roe v. Wade,"More than 1,000 protesters took to the streets of Boston Tuesday, rallying against a draft Supreme Court decision poised to overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade case that legalized abortion nationwide.<br/><br/>On the steps of the Massachusetts state house, a Planned Parenthood nurse told the story of a violent shooting at her Brookline clinic in 1994. A mother of a child in Boston Public Schools demanded better sex education for her son. A trans activist explained the challenges faced by the LGBTQ community in accessing healthcare. Striking down abortion rights, organizers argued, could impact reproductive health for a variety of communities in every state — even seemingly progressive places like Massachusetts. <br/><br/>“There’s consistent attacks on reproductive health already here in Massachusetts, even if it&#39;s not abortion access,” organizer Rachel Domond told GBH News. “Unaffordable health care, the sex education in our schools and issues with access to contraception, the list goes on.”<br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651627380700,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651627380700,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-8ca8-dfd5-adbf-9caaa6b10001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8ca7-d69c-ade1-bcaffc320000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8ca7-d69c-ade1-bcaffc010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">DSC_2634.jpg</bsp-image><br/>In 2020, the maternal mortality rate for Black women was 55.3 deaths per 100,000 live births, 2.9 times the rate for white women, according to the CDC. Racism and poverty are intertwined in the fight for reproductive justice, Domond said. <br/><br/>“Throughout history, Black women have been subject to the worst forms of bodily exploitation and regulation. It’s Black women who are more likely to live in under-resourced neighborhoods with limited access to health care, Black women who make up 7% of all single moms,” Domond said. “We’re consistently blamed for the failing social order in this country, regardless of whether we decide to abort or have kids. Enough is enough.”<br/><br/>Teresa Eliot Roberts, a nurse at Planned Parenthood in Jamaica Plain, stood before a crowd that spilled out into the Boston Common. “No matter your gender, your age, how much money you have, no matter what state you come from, I want to take care of you,” Roberts said. “We&#39;re lucky here in Massachusetts, relatively speaking. Of course, that doesn&#39;t mean much.” <br/><br/>Roberts was working at one of two Brookline Planned Parenthood offices targeted by an anti-abortion zealot in 1994. John Salvi shot and killed Roberts’ friend and colleague Shannon Lowney and Leanne Nichols, an employee at another Brookline clinic. Five others were injured in the shooting. <br/><br/>“If the anti-choice movement were really pro-life, clinic providers wouldn&#39;t be killed or threatened,” Roberts said. <br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651627469236,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651627469236,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-8caa-df4e-a7cc-bcaa158c0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8ca9-dfd5-adbf-9cabffcc0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8ca9-dfd5-adbf-9cabff8f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">DSC_2271.jpg</bsp-image><br/>Organizers from the Boston chapter of the Party for Socialism and Liberation called on elected officials to pass the Women’s Health Protection Act, a bill that would protect the right to abortion nationally and block medically unecessary restrictions or bans on abortion care. The bill passed in the U.S. House of Representatives in September of last year and failed in the Senate in February. <br/><br/>“This callous treatment of an often lifesaving health care procedure is outrageous,” organizer Maddie Dery said. “We will never be able to secure this right unless we take it to the streets. The Supreme Court is threatening a war on women&#39;s rights, and the only force capable of putting a stop to them is the people of the United States mobilizing and organizing to defend our rights.”<br/><br/>The threat to abortion access is another attack in a series of recent bills limiting healthcare for the transgender community, Allston-based activist Mandy Wilkens said. “Trans people get abortions too. Transphobia in our medical system is rampant and it’s difficult, even terrifying, to get basic things like gender affirming care.” <br/><br/>Wilkens compared the draft opinion to recent laws passed in Alabama that ban medical care for transgender youth. <br/><br/>“This is the medical care we rely on as trans people and it&#39;s under attack, these bills will kill trans kids,” Wilkens said. “This is the same appointment. Banning abortions will only ban safe abortions.

Wade was won in 1973 on the basis of mass protests led by women and other working class people. It was won despite a majority Republican court and a Republican president. We, the people, hold the power to defend abortion. Right here in the streets is where we leverage that power.” ",Tori Bedford,Tue May 03 23:04:05 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The agency plans to begin to removing the debris as early as May 13, after a contractor assembles equipment at the site and the Department of Environmental Protection conducts a required inspection. <br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651875982206,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651875982206,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-2d3f-dfd5-adbf-bdbf95fb0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017b-0daf-dcfa-ab7f-cdef20a10003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-7056-d3f4-a1dc-faff28290003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-9b7a-dfe4-a5cd-9b7e025b002d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-9b7a-dfe4-a5cd-9b7e013b0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>Residents said they noticed the construction debris was piling up for a while and that it is now the size of one-half of a football field.

Article,A 1970s Boston abortion case brought the Roe v. Wade decision into sharp focus,A 1970s Boston abortion case brought the Roe v. Wade decision into sharp focus,"I wonder if there was ever a chance that the Supreme Court’s 1973 ruling on Roe v. Wade would slow or stop the bitter debate about abortion. But the pro and anti-choice divisions have only gotten more vocal in the decades since the landmark decision. No better evidence of the heated debate than in the now-infamous leaked opinion draft signed by Associate Justice Samuel Alito. The judge, writing for the majority, declared, “<a href=""https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/3476050-five-key-lines-from-alitos-draft-overturning-roe-v-wade/"" target=""_blank"">A right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nation’s history</a>.”<br/><br/>In the week since the Washington-based news organization, Politico, published the leaked draft, anti and pro-choice supporters have taken to the streets to shout it out. As the reality set in, reenergized pro-choice activists have repledged themselves to a fight they thought they’d won.<br/><br/>And I’ve been thinking back to the Boston case which early on brought the meaning of the Roe decision into sharp focus. <br/><br/>Just months after the 1973 Supreme Court ruling, Dr. Kenneth Edelin of Boston City Hospital agreed to end the pregnancy of an unnamed Black teenager from Roxbury, who was, according to public accounts, either 17 or 18 years old. Dr. Edelin, a highly credentialed and respected gynecologist, <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1975/05/when-is-an-abortion-not-an-abortion/304931/"" target=""_blank"">soon found himself charged with manslaughter</a>.

In a 2007 Boston Globe interview, the African-American physician also noted the highly charged racial climate of 1970s Boston, saying, “It was the right place and the right time for those who wanted to make a statement. It was the wrong place and wrong time for me.” <br/><br/>Flanagan, himself a Catholic, won the case with an all-white jury which included 10 Catholics. And despite some fallacious testimony by one of the main witnesses, as documented in Dr. Edelin’s memoir, “Broken Justice: A True Story of Race Sex and Revenge in a Boston Courtroom.” He appealed and a year later the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court unanimously overturned the guilty verdict and upheld Roe’s protection for doctors who perform abortions. Dr. Kenneth Edelin became a lifelong pro-choice activist, including his three years chairing the Board of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.<br/><br/>Here’s where I’m supposed to acknowledge that Judge Alito’s leaked opinion draft is a draft, <i>not</i> the high court’s final decision. But I am convinced that it is indeed the final decision, 50 years of precedent be damned. I also know that overturning Roe v. Wade will not stop women from seeking abortions; sparked by desperation and determination, they’ll go underground.<br/><br/>One year before his conviction was overturned, Dr. Kenneth Edelin told the New York Times, “Nobody likes to do abortions, but the least we can do is make it safe and humane.” He would be appalled to know that likely that right will not be protected.",Callie Crossley,Mon May 09 05:00:29 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Article,State settles with families of Holyoke Soldiers Home victims,State settles with families of Holyoke Soldiers Home victims,"<i>Updated at 6:14 p.m.</i><br/><br/>Massachusetts has agreed to pay $56 million to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by the families of veterans who died or became sick after contracting COVID-19 at a state-run veterans&#39; care center during one of the deadliest outbreaks at a long-term care facility in the U.S., officials said Thursday.<br/><br/>The families of 84 veterans who <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-us-news-ap-top-news-ma-state-wire-lifestyle-e78173249b9c2cb327fc5da02fd8acad"">died during the outbreak at the Holyoke Soldiers&#39; Home</a> will receive a minimum of $400,000 each, while 84 veterans who contracted the disease and survived will receive a minimum of $10,000 under terms of the settlement that still requires a federal judge&#39;s approval.<br/><br/>Attorney Michael Aleo, a partner at Lesser Newman Aleo and Nasser law firm of Northampton, brought the class action lawsuit to U.S. District Court on July 17, 2020, on behalf of 160 veterans that contracted COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and June 23, 2020. He said the underlying legal issues were complicated, and the situation impacted many veterans and their families.<br/><br/>“We are very pleased by the settlement that we announced today, but it&#39;s bittersweet,” Aloe told GBH News. &quot;The families are relieved that they won&#39;t be dragged through the anguish of years of litigation and that they won&#39;t be exposed to the risks of litigation.”<br/><br/>Mary Klicka of East Longmeadow is one of the affected family members. Her dad, 94-year-old Army veteran Henry Zanetti, contracted the coronavirus at the Holyoke Soldier’s Home in March 2020. During the outbreak, he was moved from the fourth floor at the Soldiers&#39; home to a wing at the Holyoke Medical Center, where he tested positive. He survived the experience, but died Feb. 11 of this year.<br/><br/>“The most important thing is that it can&#39;t make up for our loss or for the suffering these guys went through. A lot of them were elderly. Change is very difficult for them. A lot were confused,&quot; she said. &quot;And it just caused the families and the veterans, of course, enormous pain.”<br/><br/>She added that no amount of money will erase what the families had to endure. Klicka and others involved in the lawsuit said they want to see improvements to how veterans are cared for in the state.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1652381497563,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1652381497563,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-76a0-d812-adfa-febe94b80003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017f-6f5c-d83b-a97f-7f5cbc0c0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-372d-d82a-af7c-f7fdbeef0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-b99b-d7b2-a199-bddbf3be000e&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-b99b-d7b2-a199-bddbf2e50000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>“The suit contends that what happened at the Soldiers’ Home was so severe that it rose to the level of a deprivation of the veterans’ constitutional rights to be free from harms recklessly created by the government,” Tom Lesser, one of the families&#39; attorneys, said in a statement.<br/><br/>“No amount of money can bring back the veterans who died or erase the pain and suffering that this tragedy needlessly caused those veterans and their families, but justice required that those wrongs not go unaddressed,&quot; he said. “This settlement recognizes that the tragedy was preventable and never should have happened.”<br/><br/>The number of COVID-19 deaths had previously been reported at about 76, but the higher number reflects further investigation by the state and includes veterans who contracted the disease but did not have it listed as a cause of death on their death certificate, Aleo said.<br/><br/>Former U.S. Attorney Donald Stern will serve as the settlement claims administrator and determine how much each family will receive.<br/><br/>The terms of the settlement will cover veterans who lived at the facility at any time between March 1, 2020 and June 23, 2020 and who became ill or died from COVID-19 during that period.

Dieufort Fleurissaint said he fielded concerns this year about a different kind of public safety threat: a violent racist attack. <br/><br/>“People called and asked if we should do this, with what’s happening,” Fleurissaint said. “You never know where or when these things can happen, these attacks against Black immigrants.” <br/><br/>The day before thousands marched down Blue Hill Avenue in Mattapan, where roughly one third of residents are of Haitian descent, <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2022/05/15/officials-say-a-gunmans-attack-that-killed-10-was-a-racially-motivated-hate-crime"">a man opened fire at a grocery store in a predominantly Black neighborhood of Buffalo, New York</a>, killing 10 and wounding three others. The shooter left behind a document centered on the idea of a plot to replace the white population with immigrants, a white supremacist conspiracy theory that inspired the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand, where the shooter warned of “White genocide.” <br/><br/>From Blue Hill Avenue to Harambe Park, churches, organizations, businesses, schools and dance troupes were highlighted at Sunday’s event celebrating Flag Day, which commemorates a meeting of Haitian revolutionaries in 1803 that would become a unified force against French colonizers, a holiday historically rooted in resistance. <br/><br/>“If our forefathers could have fought for 13 years to overthrow a superpower, what can&#39;t we do? So I won&#39;t let any act of white supremacy try to steal my joy,” Louijeune said. “Do I wake up with a heavy heart? Absolutely.

Article,"Bristol County sheriff calls prison phone fees 'a win for taxpayers,' but advocates say the fight isn't over","Bristol County sheriff calls prison phone fees 'a win for taxpayers,' but advocates say the fight isn't over","<i>Updated 10:29 a.m. May 19</i><br/><br/>On Tuesday, a ruling by Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ended a four-year legal battle and gave Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson’s office and others the legal authority to collect monies for the jail through phone service fees.<br/><br/>Hodgson called the decision a win for the taxpayers. But prisoner legal advocacy groups have said the legal fight isn’t over, and a decision on the issue could now move to the state Legislature.<br/><br/>“This is absolutely a win for taxpayers,” Hodgson said. “It has always been my belief as the sheriff of Bristol County that one of my most fundamental responsibilities is to minimize the burden on taxpayers for the rising costs of prison operations.”<br/><br/>The case began in 2018, when Prisoner’s Legal Services of Massachusetts, the National Law Center and private attorneys filed a class action lawsuit against Hodgson and the telephone contractor Securus Technologies. The suit alleged that the sheriff’s office was generating outside revenue through illegal kickbacks by receiving payments from the telephone contractor.<br/><br/>Jim Pingeon, litigation director with Prisoner&#39;s Legal Services, said the arrangement doubled the price of phone calls for family members of inmates and attorneys who accept telephone calls from people in any of the Bristol County jails. <br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1652913459323,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1652913459323,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-4c4c-db0e-ab7f-6cecfe0c0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000178-b3db-d908-a1f9-fbdb40520003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000173-215c-da57-a773-abff3f7c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-d950-dd35-afcd-fdfb275c0015&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-d950-dd35-afcd-fdfb268d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>According to the nonprofit, one in three families with an incarcerated loved one falls into debt trying to stay connected through phone calls and visits, and the financial burden disproportionately affects those living in low-income communities.<br/><br/>Pingeon said Prisoner’s Legal Services is disappointed in the ruling. But he added that the Supreme Judicial Court, in affirming its decision, shifted the power to the Legislature.<br/><br/>“The SJC ruling made it clear that it&#39;s up to the Legislature to decide whether or not sheriffs should be able to charge families for the exorbitant costs of prison telephones,” he said.<br/><br/>Hodgson said it is a good thing that inmates be in contact with their families, but that taxpayers shouldn’t bear the responsibility for the costs. And he said he never apologizes for making decisions that are right for the people.<br/><br/>“We have inmates that have sometimes thousands of dollars in their accounts who have plenty of money to make phone calls,” he said. “So, this just offsets the burden to taxpayers.”<br/><br/>Pingeon, however, argues that the picture is a bit more complex.<br/><br/>“It&#39;s not prisoners who pay for these calls,” Pingeon said. “It&#39;s their families and other recipients of the calls. Those people are taxpayers, too.”<br/><br/>The Massachusetts House of Representatives has already passed a measure that would make communication from prisons and jails free. It’s known as the No Cost Call bill, and it would work by creating a $20 million fund to pay for the calls. The Senate is considering a similar measure in its budget. Similar laws are in place in Connecticut, San Francisco, Los Angeles and other municipalities.<br/><br/><i>Produced with assistance from the <a href=""https://pmja.org/pmja-editor-corps/"" target=""_blank"" style=""padding: 0px; margin: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; min-height: 0px; min-width: 0px; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; color: rgb(1, 110, 190); font-weight: 700;"">Public Media Journalists Association Editor Corps</a> funded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a private corporation funded by the American people.</i><br/><br/><i>Correction: This story was updated to correct the duration of the legal battle.</i>",Marilyn Schairer,Wed May 18 18:42:52 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Authorities say the man suspected of killing 10 Black people at a local grocery store identified with <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2022/05/16/what-is-the-great-replacement-and-how-is-it-tied-to-the-buffalo-shooting-suspect"">a conspiracy theory popular among white supremacists</a>.<br/> <br/>Espinoza-Madrigal said the mass shooting was &quot;heartbreaking&quot; and law enforcement is too lax about the rise of hate crimes. <br/> <br/>&quot;The notion of being hunted down is something that people of color have experienced and continue to experience. And it is frankly irresponsible that law enforcement has not done enough to protect people of color, knowing full well that there are real threats out there,&quot; Espinoza-Madrigal said.<br/> <br/>Dr. Sandra Mattar, a clinical psychologist, assistant professor and director of training at the Immigrant and Refugee Health Center at Boston Medical Center, said the trauma caused by such attacks can have significant implications on the heath of people of color.<br/><br/>&quot;You suffer from race-based traumatic stress and you cannot be at ease, you cannot even breathe at ease. So, this has significant implications to your sense of safety in the world, your sense of identity, your sense of trust and functioning out there in the world. And so, there is no place where you can feel safe, except for a few places in your community. And that has significant implications to your health,&quot; Mattar said. <br/> <br/>Moving forward and making change starts with public policy, and voting for elected officials who will create such policies, said Dr. Clarence Lusane, professor of political science and director of the international affairs program at Howard University.<br/> <br/>&quot;The whole point of voting is electing people that will push through public policy that can begin to move this country in the right direction.

Article,"Omicron variant caused more deaths in Mass. in shorter period than delta did, new study finds","Omicron variant caused more deaths in Mass. in shorter period than delta did, new study finds","The omicron variant of SARS-COV-2 caused more “excess deaths” in Massachusetts in eight weeks this year than the delta variant did in 23 weeks when it was the dominant variant. Excess deaths are a measure of how many more deaths occur in a given time period than would normally be predicted for a population. <br/><br/>The excess deaths caused by omicron during the study period occurred despite existing evidence that those who caught that version of COVID-19 tended to have less dangerous outcomes, according to a<a href=""https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2792738?guestAccessKey=06de6afa-b2b3-4b35-bf84-1481a93d38d4&amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=052022"" style=""text-decoration:none;""> <u>new study</u></a> published Friday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.<br/><br/>The study found 2,294 excess deaths in Massachusetts during the omicron surge from late December 2021 to late February of this year — 16% more than the 1,975 deaths reported during the delta variant surge that lasted from June to December of last year. The study attributes the increase in excess deaths to omicron’s high contagiousness.<br/><br/>“The data that we published really slams home an important point for me,” said Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital, and the lead author of the study, “which is that — even in a state that is highly vaccinated and in which there have been a lot of infections, so people have a lot of immunity — still, a variant that&#39;s quote unquote &#39;milder&#39; can cause this massive amount of increase in mortality.”<br/><br/>Faust said his team’s findings underscored the impact of the omicron variant’s contagiousness.<br/><br/>“This is the idea that, OK, maybe it&#39;s a slightly lower fatality rate for every infection,” Faust said, “but you multiply that by a far, far higher number of infections and you get a big number. So if it&#39;s half as deadly but ten times as contagious, you have a massive increase in mortality.”<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1653086596226,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1653086596226,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-ce70-d39c-a5f8-de7825860003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-9a33-d08c-a5cc-9bbf10600003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-d063-d7c0-ab8c-f267432c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-d7f4-dd35-afcd-ffffa0680003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-e3a2-df1e-a1fa-fbbeed8e0028&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-e3a2-d0cd-a1ff-efbac9b50000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>The increase in mortality associated with the omicron variant disproportionally affected residents of color in Massachusetts, said Dr. Cassandra Pierre, an infectious disease physician who is the associate hospital epidemiologist and the medical director of public health programs at Boston Medical Center.<br/><br/>Pierre said, before the omicron surge, the gap in COVID-19 deaths between Black people and white people was closing. But she said that gap widened again during the surge at the start of the year.<br/><br/>“And there may be multiple reasons for that,” said Pierre, “I mean, we do still know that our Black population is under-vaccinated relative to the white population. … I&#39;m certainly sure that the Black population is un-boostered relative to the white population.&quot; <br/><br/>She also said racial health disparities and impacts of the ongoing pandemic also contribute.<br/><br/>“I&#39;m talking about the pandemic itself, with the relative isolation, the inability to see a health care provider reliably in person, some people being laid off,” Pierre added. &quot;There was a greater economic toll in Black and brown communities, and hence the lack of health insurance and the ability to even engage in health care that goes along with that.”<br/><br/>Faust said it’s important to note that the study found that excess deaths for both the last omicron surge and the delta surge were up in all age groups in the state. For example, he said, about 300 more residents between the ages of 18 and 49 died than the number who would have if there was no pandemic.<br/><br/>“And I always stop to think that it&#39;s sad that because it&#39;s not thousands or hundreds of thousands or a million that that seems like not very much,” Faust said, “But actually 300 deaths among adults 18 to 49 in a state that has about one-fiftieth of the population of the country, you start doing the math and you realize that this is every bit as big of a crisis for young adults as … the opioid crisis, HIV/AIDS — it&#39;s similarly lethal and we lose track of that.”<br/><br/>Faust expects more excess deaths in the current surge, but he said it’s still unclear right now what the best public health response should be.<br/><br/>“The reality is that people will only listen to our advice and our guidance and our observations once in a while,” said Faust. “And so while I personally am wearing a mask in most situations … you have to decide when to spend your clout.”<br/><br/>“And it&#39;s frustrating because we could get to zero deaths right now,&quot; he added. &quot;We won&#39;t, but maybe that&#39;s because we&#39;re hoping that in the next big wave we will have more people come along for doing the right thing and saving a lot of lives at once.”",Mark Herz,Fri May 20 18:43:19 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New England beaches, such conduct has become more frequent following the reopening of beaches closed in the first wave of COVID-19. <br/><br/>Jim Farrell, president of the New England Region of the United States Lifesaving Association, an organization of lifeguards and open water rescuers, said lack of staff at beaches contributes to the problem. <br/><br/>“I can&#39;t speak for a lot of other places, but I do know that between the shortness of lifeguards, the shortness of staff in general on facilities, and alcohol on beaches ... these are all issues,” he said. <br/><br/>Farrell said that many beach facilities in the region simply don’t have anyone on site with the authority — beyond lifeguards — to stop the negative behavior.<br/><br/>“One of the big differences between New England beaches and Florida, etc., they&#39;re all working as part of fire departments and [have] sworn officers and stuff on the beaches,” he said. “We just don&#39;t have a lot of that on our beaches.”<br/><br/>Part of this has to do with how the beaches are managed across the region, where there isn’t always a coordinated public safety effort. <br/><br/>“It&#39;s each individual town and what they can do and whether they&#39;re a state facility or a town facility,” he said. “Every single one is different.”<br/><bsp-tweet

Article,‘Play is for everyone’: A mom on a mission to make playgrounds accessible for kids of all abilities ,‘Play is for everyone’: A mom on a mission to make playgrounds accessible for kids of all abilities ,"Julie Kenerson loved taking her two sons to the Charlestown playground in Mayor Thomas M. Menino Park. Its accessible design allowed Lukas to play side-by-side with his brother Jake, who had a rare metabolic disorder and used a wheelchair. The playground has plenty of ramps and wheelchair-accessible swings. Lukas and Jake could spin on the carousel together and glide down slides at the same time. <br/><br/>They also loved Martin’s Park in the Seaport district, where they could go on adventures in the wooden fishing boat, which had a ramp at its entrance. But not all playgrounds were accessible for Jake. <br/><br/>“I&#39;d be sitting here with Jake singing songs because there was really nothing for him to play with,” Kenerson said about<b> </b>the lack of wheelchair-friendly playground elements at many town playgrounds. <br/><br/>In 2019, Jake passed away at age 11 from complications of his CDG, congenital disorder of glycosylation. Since Jake’s death, his mom has been on a mission to make playgrounds more accessible — starting with their hometown of Arlington, where Kenerson is working with local officials to make playgrounds more welcoming to kids and caregivers with disabilities. <br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1653488917559,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000168-2a01-dff6-a1ef-fabd12060000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1653488917559,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000168-2a01-dff6-a1ef-fabd12060000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-d32a-dd35-afcd-ffbb4aec0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-bf93-dc47-a77f-bfb792220003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017b-2b58-daa6-ad7f-ffddcdca0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-fb75-d0cd-a1ff-ff7dff100013&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-fb75-d0cd-a1ff-ff7dfec80000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>Over the past decade, playground accessibility has advanced due to more awareness and more options for designers. Parents like Kenerson are telling public officials and planners that more work still needs to be done to make them truly inclusive — and those in charge are listening. In Arlington, workers will start construction next month on a new playground design that incorporates Kenerson’s feedback.<br/><br/>“I really think a lot of people don&#39;t think about it because they don&#39;t have to,” she said. “But if they knew about it, they would actually care and they would want it to be better.”<br/><h3>ADA compliance is just the beginning</h3><br/>The landmark Americans With Disabilities Act, which mandates equal access for people with disabilities in public spaces, was passed in 1991, but didn’t specifically address outdoor recreation in its original regulations. Updated guidance <a href=""https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/2010ADAStandards/2010ADAStandards_prt.pdf"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>came in 2010</u></a>, and any playground that is now built or renovated must be ADA-compliant.<br/><br/>But, Kenerson says, that ADA standard for playgrounds is a bare minimum and doesn’t necessarily make playgrounds inclusive for kids like Jake. She is raising awareness about the gap between what she calls “ADA on paper and the lived experience of ADA,” which takes some extra effort to address.<br/><br/>“One of my main themes is: play should be for everybody,” she said. “But we have to design the spaces so that play<i> can</i> be for everyone.” <br/><br/>The responsibility for making the playground accessible depends on where it’s located. It could be overseen by a local town parks department, a city department, the statewide recreation departments or a school or a daycare. <br/><br/><b>Watch: Jake plays on an accessible carousel</b><bsp-raw-html html=""&lt;div style=\&quot;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25% ; height: 0;\&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;iframe style=\&#39;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0;\&#39; id=\&#39;partnerPlayer\&#39; frameborder=\&#39;0\&#39; marginwidth=\&#39;0\&#39; marginheight=\&#39;0\&#39; scrolling=\&#39;no\&#39; width=\&#39;100%\&#39; height=\&#39;100%\&#39; src=\&#39;https:\/\/player.pbs.org\/partnerplayer\/pvCcQ_ctXbygomOo-VWRNQ==\/?start=0&amp;end=0&amp;topbar=false&amp;autoplay=false&amp;endscreen=false\&#39; allowfullscreen allow=\&quot;encrypted-media\&quot;&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;\r\n&lt;\/div&gt;"">Raw Html</bsp-raw-html><br/><br/>Last year, Arlington made plans to update several school playgrounds on town land. Officials decided to use funds the town received under the American Rescue Plan Act to renovate the Stratton Elementary School playground and two others. <br/><br/>When the town put out a survey to gather feedback from residents, Kenerson, a sixth grade teacher in Wellesley public schools, saw an opportunity to share her family’s story. She started meeting with town officials, the Stratton principal and the vendor who would be supporting the project. <br/><br/>“I was the one who was asking questions about accessibility,” she said. “I come from the lens of having gone to playgrounds with an able-bodied kid and a kid in a wheelchair.” <br/><br/>One sticking point, literally, was the ground surface material. The original plan had mulch in the design — which is technically ADA-compliant, but not easy to navigate for some kids or caregivers. <br/><br/>“What I know as a parent of a kid in a wheelchair is, as soon as you get to mulch, it&#39;s so hard to move a wheelchair,” Kenerson said. The surface is also difficult for a visually impaired person who uses a cane, or anyone who uses a walker. <br/><br/>Kenerson recalls a meeting in which the playground designer pointed out several elements that made the playground accessible by ADA standards, including a staircase with a bottom stair large enough to allow kids in wheelchairs to transfer themselves out of their wheelchair — a practice that requires upper body strength that not all wheelchair-using kids have.<br/><br/>Other elements that were technically ADA-compliant: one of the bridges was tall enough to allow a wheelchair underneath, and there was a “social space” for kids in wheelchairs to play with other kids.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1653489584305,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000168-2a01-dff6-a1ef-fabd12060000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1653489584305,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000168-2a01-dff6-a1ef-fabd12060000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;quote&quot;:&quot;“I come from the lens of having gone to playgrounds with an able-bodied kid and a kid in a wheelchair.” &quot;,&quot;attribution&quot;:&quot;-Julie Kenerson&quot;,&quot;fallbackToPerson&quot;:false,&quot;useGrayBackground&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-fba8-d0cd-a1ff-ffb891990014&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000162-022d-dc51-ab7b-96bf02e20008&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-fba8-d0cd-a1ff-ffb8914e0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>Town officials and planners were receptive to conversations about accessibility once Kenerson raised concerns, and her work paid off: all three designs that were put out for bids in March will have rubberized surfaces, not mulch. The Stratton playground will also have an accessible carousel and a wheelchair-accessible picnic table. <br/><br/>The town plans to start construction in June to get the playground ready for the start of the school year. Joe Connelly, director of the town’s recreation department, says there is no question about Kenerson’s impact on the final playground designs.<br/><br/>“She really raised the level of, ‘Hey, look — checking the box that it meets ADA really isn&#39;t where we want to be as a town,’” he said. “‘We should strive for more.’”<br/><h3>Towns and cities look through a new lens</h3><br/>In some ways, Arlington was already ahead of the curve on accessibility. In 2014, the town worked with the Institute for Human Centered Design to conduct a self-analysis of accessibility in the town’s recreation activities. Connelly believes that Arlington was the only town recreation department who conducted such a study to inform future design. Now, the rest of the state is catching up. <br/><br/>There are plenty of obstacles to reaching true inclusivity for kids like Jake, playground planners and town officials say. It depends on a variety of factors for each municipality: awareness, resources, maintenance costs, size of space and, of course, budget. <br/><br/>Connelly says that the poured-in rubber surface that is considered most accessible can be at least five times as expensive as mulch, which can force towns with a limited budget into a tough balancing act between accessibility and having less money to spend on equipment. <br/><br/>The Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, which oversees more than 70 playgrounds across the commonwealth, is currently working on plans to renovate the Marine Park Playground in South Boston in fall 2022. <br/><br/>“In terms of the accessibility in the play area, our designers and the department always now go above and beyond what is a minimum requirement by law,” said Tom McCarthy, director of the DCR&#39;S Universal Access Program. “Whatever those requirements are, we do go beyond those.”<br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1653485221934,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000168-2a01-dff6-a1ef-fabd12060000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1653485221934,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000168-2a01-dff6-a1ef-fabd12060000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;migration.alignment&quot;:&quot;RIGHT&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-fb5d-de37-a399-ff5f62e50000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-fb5d-de37-a399-ff5fa02f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:&quot;/enhancement/EnhancementRight.hbs&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-fb5d-de37-a399-ff5fa01a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">Jake, sits on a black metal swing in a colorful playground. A man in a purple shirt pushes the swing.</bsp-image><br/>The renovated ocean-themed Marine Park will feature more accessible paved paths, rubber surfacing throughout and accessible picnic tables and swings. Elevated play areas will be connected with ramps. <br/><br/>Going “above and beyond” on accessibility means that the DCR thinks about all types of disabilities, McCarthy says. Plans incorporate bright contrasting colors and tactile elements for kids who may be blind or low-vision, special elements for kids who have different small motor abilities and quiet spaces for kids who have autism.<br/><br/>Sandra Libby, a playground planner at the DCR says that, even in the last decade, “so many more options” for playground elements have become available, like large gliders that can fit a wheelchair and rock back and forth. She said the new creative solutions give planners like her more ways to make playgrounds accessible.<br/><h3>Remembering Jake </h3><br/>Kenerson’s advocacy left a mark on Arlington. She says she has already seen that the town officials in Arlington are starting to bring up accessibility in design conversations without being prompted. Connelly also plans to work with Kenerson on future design projects. <br/><br/>Many families of kids with disabilities don’t have time to do advocacy work, Kenerson says, because they are busy with their jobs and caring for their children. She hopes her collaboration can serve as a model for all towns.<br/><br/>“It&#39;s been two and a half years since [Jake] passed away, and I actually feel like I have time in my life now to do this advocacy work, and it still means a lot,” Kenerson said. “So on a very personal level, I feel like I&#39;m honoring my son by helping all of his friends and all people like him.”<br/>",Meghan Smith,Thu May 26 05:00:26 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that can be targeted by the suit.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#39;re holding these manufacturers accountable for their deception, [and] requiring them to pay back every last dollar our state has spent on their products to clean up the contamination,&quot; Healey said. &quot;We want them to restore our precious natural resources and ensure that the water we drink and use in our daily lives is not at risk as a result of PFAS products here in Massachusetts.&quot;<br/><br/>Healey said PFAS contamination has been found in more than 80 Massachusetts communities, including Stowe, Chicopee, Weymouth, Abington, Rockland and on <u><a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2021/03/05/researchers-find-previously-undetected-forever-chemicals-in-cape-cod-waters"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">Cape Cod</a></u>.<br/><br/>The attorney general’s lawsuit was filed in federal district court, and Healey said it will likely be consolidated with hundreds of other lawsuits that have been filed against the manufacturers. <br/><br/>The lawsuit is focused on contamination caused by the presence of PFAS in firefighting foam, but Healey acknowledged the chemicals are in products ranging from non-stick cookware to cosmetics. <br/><br/>&quot;Our focus and our lens is on targeting the people that actually made PFAS in whatever form, so that we&#39;re able to recover and secure money to help remedy the situation,&quot; she said. <br/><br/>In April, a state task force focused on PFAS contamination <u><a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2022/04/20/pfas-task-force-releases-recommendations-to-state-officials"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">issued a report</a></u> making 30 recommendations, including increasing funding for detection and remediation of the chemicals, expanding regulation of PFAS and supporting people who have become sick as a result of exposure to the chemicals.<br/><br/>The president of the Professional Firefighters of Massachusetts, Richard MacKinnon Jr., praised the suit at Wednesday&#39;s press conference. &quot;More firefighters die of occupational cancer than anything else we face,&quot; MacKinnon said. &quot;And this PFAS, these forever chemicals, has been proven and linked to cause these cancers that our firefighters get. So we see this as a great step in that fight against the epidemic of firefighter cancer.&quot;<br/><br/>In February, a group of 15 Massachusetts firefighters who have been diagnosed with or treated for cancer <u><a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2022/02/16/mass-firefighters-sue-equipment-providers-over-pfas"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">sued more than 20 manufacturers</a></u> and distributors of their protective clothing because it contained PFAS.<br/><br/>State Senator Julian Cyr, who represents Cape Cod communities affected by contamination, said at Wednesday&#39;s press conference that the issue is extensive and costly.<br/><br/>&quot;While we are working to allocate resources in the legislature and putting forward a road map about how we phase out PFAS in our environment and reduce the risk of health exposures, this lawsuit is really going to begin to garner the true resources that we need to address the issue and have those responsible for these affects paying for it,&quot; Cyr said. <br/><br/>In a statement, 3M defended its product, aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF), as a critical tool. <br/><br/>&quot;To this day, the only product that meets the military specification governing firefighting foam is PFAS-based AFFF, due to these substances’ unique and life-saving properties,&quot; the statement reads. &quot;3M acted responsibly in connection with its manufacture and sale of AFFF and will vigorously defend its record of environmental stewardship.&quot;<br/><br/>Another company named in the lawsuit, Dupont de Nemours, said in a statement to GBH News that through a complicated history of mergers and spinning off of companies, they aren&#39;t responsible for PFAS and shouldn&#39;t have been named in Healey&#39;s suit.<br/><br/>&quot;DuPont de Nemours has never manufactured PFOA, PFOS or firefighting foam,&quot; the statement reads. &quot;While we don’t comment on pending litigation, we believe this complaint is without merit, and is the latest example of DuPont de Nemours being improperly named in litigation. We look forward to vigorously defending our record of safety, health and environmental stewardship.”<br/>",Craig LeMoult,Wed May 25 16:01:32 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,"Pembroke town officials vote to disband diversity, equity and inclusion committee","Pembroke town officials vote to disband diversity, equity and inclusion committee","The Select Board of Pembroke voted 3-2 Wednesday night to disband a diversity, equity and inclusion committee that had become a source of contention in the town since starting its work five months ago. <br/><br/>The 10-member committee held its first meeting in January 2022, according to minutes posted online. Its stated <a href=""https://www.pembroke-ma.gov/select-board/DEI"" target=""_blank"">goals</a> included facilitating discussions regarding diversity, equity and inclusion in the town and seeking out and suggesting opportunities, programs and activities that promote those goals in the community.<br/><br/>Opponents claimed having the committee went against the wishes of town voters and that its work could be done by a private group, while supporters said it was needed to help improve the town of 18,000 in Plymouth County. According to 2010 <a href=""https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/pembroketownplymouthcountymassachusetts,US/POP010210"" target=""_blank"">census data</a>, Pembroke is more than 90 percent white. <br/><br/>Carly Levy, a member of the DEI committee, spoke before the board&#39;s vote. She said the group was on the precipice of making accomplishments and argued it&#39;s important the community looks to make itself more welcoming in the current national climate, pointing to the mass shootings the country is currently mourning. <br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1653536911358,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-dc46-dd0e-abfa-fc7f12090000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1653536911358,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-dc46-dd0e-abfa-fc7f12090000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000178-65c5-db78-a17c-65dd86ed0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000179-cc2a-dcfc-a1fd-defafd760000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-fe7a-df1e-a1fa-fefe27680005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-fe7a-df1e-a1fa-fefe24de0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>&quot;And I think that this is an opportunity for us to remind each other that diversity, equity and inclusion is not just about race,&quot; she said. &quot;This is about everybody.

Today is the annivesary of George Floyd&#39;s murder, so all of these things I think we need to look at in terms of the role of this committee.&quot;<br/><br/>The committee included representatives from the town&#39;s police, fire and school departments and public library, in addition to six residents. A slot for a Pembroke High School student had remained unfilled.<br/><br/>Tracy Marino, vice chair of the select board, originally voted for the committee. But she ended up voting against it Wednesday.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#39;m not opposed to such a group,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;m not even a hundred percent opposed to it here, but I&#39;m concerned that there&#39;s not enough faith in it, I feel like, to be productive.&quot;<br/><br/>The vote followed a public comment hearing that at times grew heated and sometimes reflected the tone seen at school board meetings across the nation on issues surrounding critical race theory. <br/><br/>Steven Ciciotti, another select board member who voted to disband the committee, claimed the group&#39;s work could be done by a private entity. <br/><br/>&quot;The question, the issue is, the really big contention that&#39;s happening is, is it the role of the government?&quot; he said. &quot;And the people have spoken many times on this. And each time they have spoken on it, the majority has grown and grown and grown.&quot;<br/><br/>But Rebecca Coletta, a member of the select board who voted in favor of keeping the committee, doesn&#39;t believe that explanation.<br/><br/>&quot;I just think it comes down to not wanting to talk about race or LGBTQ issues,&quot; she said. <br/><br/>Coletta said the work must continue, even without the committee.<br/><br/>&quot;We can&#39;t simply say government&#39;s role is to turn a blind eye to this,&quot; she said. &quot;If that were the case, we wouldn&#39;t have the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act or Title IX.

College grads are finishing up a crazy four years — two of them against the backdrop of a global pandemic — and many are looking forward to sitting in their seats, waiting for their names to be announced and receiving words of wisdom from someone of note in a rite of passage known as the commencement speech. Just this week, for example, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu has been busy giving commencement speeches for Bunker Hill Community College and UMass Boston.</i><br/><br/><i>One of the most celebrated commencement speeches from recent years was from actor and screenwriter Charlie Day, of the popular show “It&#39;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.” The 2014 commencement address he delivered at his alma mater, Merrimack College, went viral for its wit and life lessons. What follows is a lightly edited transcript from a conversation with Day on GBH&#39;s </i>Morning Edition.<br/><br/><b>Paris Alston: </b>It makes you wonder, what does it take to write a good commencement speech? One that doesn&#39;t make the crowd yawn, or fall asleep or — the worst — get up and walk out.

Jeremy found out how it came about. <br/><br/><b>Jeremy Siegel: </b>OK, cool. So to get started, what was your process for putting together a commencement address? <br/><br/><b>Day: </b>I’d had a breakfast out here in Los Angeles with some people from Merrimack College, and they asked me if I would give a commencement address. And I sort of quickly just said, “Yeah, sure, that sounds like fun.” And then the reality of it started to set in on me where I thought, “Oh my gosh, wait a second, there&#39;s going to be people with their families with them. I have to think of something to say.” And I really didn&#39;t know how to approach it. <br/><br/>So I opened up one of my screenwriting applications — it&#39;s called Final Draft, you know something I would write an episode of “It&#39;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” with — and I wrote the character “Charlie.” And I wrote, like, “Charlie is at the podium.” And then I just started writing the speech bit by bit. <br/><br/><b>Siegel: </b>So you were doing it in character, as Charlie?<br/><br/><b>Day: </b>More or less in character, yeah, the character of Charlie Day. And so I just wrote it as if it was dialogue for movie or something. <br/><br/>And then I figured, also — I&#39;m not a standup comedian, but I imagine there was a certain expectation that I would make the students laugh, right? So I thought, “OK, I&#39;ve got to start with some jokes and then I have to work into some meaningful material and just see how it comes out.”<br/><br/><i>[cut to recording]</i><br/><br/><b>Merrimack announcer:</b> I now have the honor of introducing this year&#39;s commencement speaker, Mr. Charlie Day.<br/><br/><b>Day, in speech: </b>You are graduating from an excellent school today.

You know, I mean, you gave this speech in 2014, you mentioned at the time that “It&#39;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” was one of the longest-running comedies on TV. That was nearly a decade ago. You&#39;re still going. I mean, looking back even to yourself at Merrimack, when you were in college, how do you think you would be thinking about where you are right now? <br/><br/><b>Day: </b>You know, I&#39;m — I love what I get to do, and I&#39;m grateful that I&#39;ve gotten to do it. At the same time, you know, I still do have a side of me that says, &quot;OK, but let&#39;s press through and accomplish more.&quot; I have a lot more that I want to do and things that I feel like I haven&#39;t accomplished that I could or that I should. So, you know, it&#39;s that balance. <br/><br/>But I&#39;m sure when I was in Merrimack College, if you would&#39;ve told me that all this would have panned out, I would have been really happy. <br/><br/><i>[cut to recording]</i><br/><br/><b>Day, in speech: </b>Now, listen up. You cannot let a fear of failure or a fear of comparison or a fear of judgment stop you from doing what&#39;s going to make you great. You cannot succeed without this risk of failure. You cannot have a voice without the risk of criticism. And you cannot love without the risk of loss. <br/><br/><i>[recording ends]</i><br/><br/><b>Siegel: </b>You gave this address that we&#39;ve been talking about in 2014. Kids in school have obviously gone through a lot since then. What would your message to students graduating today be? <br/><br/><b>Day:</b> You&#39;re asking me to do an impromptu graduation speech? <br/><br/><b>Siegel:</b> Yeah. Yeah. After you said you never wanted to do one again.<br/><br/><b>Day: </b>I mean, I didn&#39;t want to do it, and I spent a lot of time writing that one out. Oh, man. <br/><br/>I feel so much sympathy for these kids. I have a son and he&#39;s about to finish fourth grade. And this [pandemic] started for him in second grade. And I really feel for how much of his childhood that he&#39;s dealt with this — in closures and masking and Zoom and everything else.<br/><br/>But look, what are you going to do? You have to kind of carry on. And for the kids today, I would say, you don&#39;t pick yourself up and carry on. Look, you could have grown up through the Great Depression. You could have grown up through World War II. You could have been sent away to Vietnam. You&#39;re dealing with the pandemic. So, this is your burden to bear. <br/><br/>But that kind of stuff is not going to stop. I mean, since graduating college, I was living in New York City on 9/11. I&#39;ve been through this pandemic. You know, things happen. You see things. That&#39;s just a part of life. So I would say just, just press on and just keep going — because there will be some dark times, but there will be plenty of light times. And, you know, you have to just carry on. <br/><br/><b>Siegel: </b>Well, Charlie, you said in your address that you wanted to go by Dr. Charlie Day.<br/><br/><i>[cut to recording]</i><br/><br/><b>Day: </b>And although I acknowledge that “Dr. Charlie Day” sounds like some sort of club DJ, I assure you, I intend to go by this title from now on. <br/><br/><i>[recording ends]</i><br/><br/><b>Siegel: </b>I&#39;m going to address you by your full title here: Dr. Charlie Day, thank you so much for talking with us. <br/><br/><b>Day: </b>Thanks for watching “It’s Sunny” and being a fan and enjoying the speech.

Two other field offices, which Wray did not name, assisted the Boston FBI office with the effort.<br/><br/>The FBI first contacted Boston Children&#39;s administrators on Aug. 3, 2021. Wray said over the next 10 days the FBI coordinated with hospital computer experts to thwart malicious cyber activities, which at that point was clearly identified originating from Iranian sources.<br/><br/>Wray pointed out that it was the second time the hospital had been targeted.

The older ones get kibbled dog food. Kilham also introduces wild plants, like dandelions, into their diet.<br/><br/>And the cubs practice finding food in the woods, exploring streams, trees and rotting logs.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#39;s a sort of a smell thing,&quot; Kilham said. &quot;Well, it&#39;s fun, but they&#39;re also smelling grubs or bugs or ants that are in there. And their claws are made for digging. So they&#39;re getting muscle memory in that sense.&quot;<br/><br/>They pull branches down and mouth the buds and leaves. Their nasal systems can detect what’s edible and what’s not.<br/><br/>Kilham is a facilitator, not an instructor.<br/><br/>&quot;I am the safe spot where they are comfortable enough that they can explore the environment without having to think about safety,&quot; he said.<br/><br/>The older cubs, who were born last year, live on 11 acres of woods hugged by an electric fence. Ethan Kilham still brings them food, and they also find their own. His uncle, Ben Kilham, points out the enclosure on top of some ledges.<br/><br/>&quot;See the leaning tree?&quot; Ben Kilham said. &quot;Right beyond is a narrow white post. That’s where the fence is going through.&quot;<br/><br/>Ben Kilham began developing this method of rehabilitating abandoned and orphaned cubs, like Alma, 30 years ago.<br/><br/>&quot;When I started, if you read the literature, it said that bear cubs could be released back into the wild at five months and they’d survive. And that didn’t make any sense at all,&quot; Ben Kilham said, because 18 months is when wild black bears leave their mothers.<br/><br/>Using logic and knowledge about how wild cubs grow up, Ben Kilham developed a surrogate mother approach. With help from his wife, Debbie Kilham; his sister, Phoebe Kilham; and now Ethan, the Kilham Bear Center has raised and released nearly 400 cubs.<br/><br/>But Ben Kilham said there are rules for Ethan or anyone raising them.<br/><br/>&quot;You don&#39;t initiate play or anything with them. But if they want to play with you, you can respond. You&#39;ve got to remember that young animals are young animals,&quot; he said.<br/><br/>And many of these young animals, like Alma, were present when their mothers were killed.<br/><br/>&quot;They have to have a nurturing environment. You don&#39;t shut them off of all of that,&quot; he said.<br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1654262115054,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1654262115054,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;migration.alignment&quot;:&quot;RIGHT&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-29b2-de37-a399-6ff2bd6c0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-29b2-d0cd-a1ff-2dbaaf680000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:&quot;/enhancement/EnhancementRight.hbs&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-29b2-d0cd-a1ff-2dbaaf3b0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">Three small black bear cubs walk and sit on the straw-covered floor of a room.</bsp-image><br/>Back in the cub barn, Willa was still wary of me. Ethan Kilham calmed her with a soft voice.<br/><br/>&quot;What is up here? What is up?” he said.<br/><br/>Alma was making herself scarce. All three cubs were tucked onto a shelf, high off the ground. I climbed a ladder to get my microphone closer.<br/><br/>Billie sniffed the microphone and licked my hand. She was using her keen sense of smell to check me out.<br/><br/>Then she lightly touched my hand with her teeth.<br/><br/>I decided it was time to get down on the ground.<br/><br/>Ethan and Ben Kilham said there’s no risk that interacting with me briefly — or them — will turn these cubs into animals who trust all people.<br/><br/>&quot;Bears trust individuals,&quot; Ben Kilham said. &quot;They don&#39;t trust broadly. Bears trust each other as individuals. They trust humans as individuals. Just because she trusts me doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;ll trust the guy standing next to me.&quot;<br/><br/>State wildlife agencies trust Kilham’s approach so much that three states — Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont — bring him cubs to raise. He said his cubs’ survival rate in the wild is high and the bears he releases aren’t any more likely to break into chicken coops or trash cans than other bears.<br/><br/>Kilham said humans are responsible for some nuisance behavior because they don’t understand bears are driven by food.<br/><br/>&quot;Food to a bear is like money to a person,&quot; he said. &quot;You know the world wouldn’t go around leaving $100 bills all over their yard and expect no one would pick them up. That’s what you do when you have food attractants.&quot;<br/><br/>In Massachusetts, by law, people can kill a bear that destroys chickens, bees or other property.<br/><br/>Cars, like the one that killed Alma’s family, hit 30 to 50 bears a year. Hunters kill another 250. Still the population is healthy and growing with about 4,000 bears in the state.<br/><br/>Black bear biologist David Wattles of the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife said population concerns are not why bears like Alma are rehabilitated.<br/><br/>&quot;The alternative in that situation is to euthanize that cub, because it doesn&#39;t have a mother to take care of it,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&#39;t think anyone is looking to do that.&quot;<br/><br/>Including hunters like Brandon Lagoy, the Greenfield police officer who rescued Alma.<br/><br/>&quot;Even people that hunt, when it becomes a baby, it changes things, right?&quot; Lagoy said. &quot;You don&#39;t want to see harm done to anything like that. And so it just became a priority for us to make sure that it had the same opportunity as every other bear in the wild, and to be rehabilitated, and put back out and set free.&quot;<br/><br/>This time of year, the older cubs at the Kilham Bear Center are being set free. New Hampshire and Vermont wildlife biologists tag and release them into the woods.<br/><br/>If all goes well, in about a year, Alma from Greenfield will also be back in the wild — and eventually, raise her own cubs.<br/><br/><i><a href=""https://www.nepm.org/regional-news/2022-06-01/raising-an-orphaned-cub-from-greenfield-so-it-can-return-to-a-bears-world"" target=""_blank"">This story originally appeared on NEPM.</a></i>",Nancy Eve Cohen | NEPM,Fri Jun 03 09:05:49 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,Marginalized LGBTQ groups will be integral to the next chapter of Boston's Pride movement,Marginalized LGBTQ groups will be integral to the next chapter of Boston's Pride movement,"There will be one less parade returning to Boston’s streets this summer. The colorful, joyous Pride Parade is no more. Organized by The Boston Pride Group, the parade was the highpoint of June’s Pride Month, and a celebration of LGBTQ folks from Boston and the region. <br/><br/>What began as a public political statement raising awareness about gay and transgender issues became better known as an event characterized by boisterous street merrymaking sponsored by corporate cash. <br/><br/>The Pride Parade was canceled in 2020, a victim of the pandemic, but last year <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2022/04/13/iconic-boston-pride-parade-will-not-return-this-summer"">it was axed for good because of simmering intracommunity tensions</a> — tensions that eventually boiled over, splintering the local lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and queer community in a Biblical-sized dispute. During the last several years, the 50-year-old Boston Pride Group was at odds with the multiple other smaller LGBTQ organizations and community groups.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1654441404981,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1654441404981,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-23dd-d400-a7d5-37ddb8f40003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-1a84-df1e-a1fb-5abedddf0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017f-f52d-d150-a9ff-f53de6730003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-3463-daaa-abab-7d7397f2002d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-3463-daaa-abab-7d7397220000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>Public flareups increased in 2015, when Black Lives Matter protestors demonstrated at the annual Pride Parade demanding the mostly white leadership expand the participation of people of color. The online magazine <a href=""https://quillette.com/2021/10/13/the-implosion-of-bostons-pride-parade-is-a-sign-of-things-to-come/"" target=""_blank"">Quillette cites the formal statement of activists’ ultimatums</a>, part of which read, “We demand a Pride Board as diverse as our community, and not solely comprised of wealthy white capitalist gays and lesbians.” <br/><br/>It got worse after the murder of George Floyd. Most of Boston Pride’s volunteer staff resigned after claiming the formal statement — shaped by Black Pride members and released by the organization — was weakened without<i> </i>their permission. Quillette detailed specific revisions: one replaced the words “police violence” with “violence committed by some members of the law enforcement community,&quot; and the line “Oppressions are interlocked, no one is free until we are all free. #blacklivesmatter” was replaced with “No one is free until we are all free. We are #BostonPride #WickedProud.&quot;<br/><br/>The oft-repeated “Pride goeth before the fall” is actually a shortened version of the original verse from Proverbs 16:18 — which explains the lead up to a fall from grace, and this particular fall from grace — “Pride goeth before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall.” There was apparently plenty of “haughty spirit” infiltrating The Boston Pride Group. <br/><br/>The organization officially dissolved last year, having failed to listen to the voices of nonwhite gay and trans people, which is especially ironic for an organization dedicated to inclusion. Tre’ Andre Valentine, the executive director of the Massachusetts Transgender Political Coalition, told GBH News, “The previous Pride events didn’t really feel — for a lot of trans people, for a lot of people of color — like it was for us.”<br/><br/>In the absence of the old Boston Pride parade, several community groups this month are hosting a variety of Pride events including parades throughout the region. This time the formerly marginalized LGBTQ groups will be integral to leadership and participation. That will be essential in building the next chapter of the local Pride movement.",Callie Crossley,Mon Jun 06 05:00:44 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The order directs the department to identify alternatives to single-use plastics, such as compostable or biodegradable materials or 100% recycled materials.<br/><br/>“As the steward of the nation’s public lands, including national parks and national wildlife refuges, and as the agency responsible for the conservation and management of fish, wildlife, plants and their habitats,&#39;&#39; the Interior Department is “uniquely positioned to do better for our Earth,” Haaland said in a statement.<br/><br/>The order essentially reverses a <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/science-health-business-environment-recycling-e40323953e5adffb32f73b60c9bb2202"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; color: var(--linkLightColor); text-decoration: none; background-color: transparent; font-size: inherit; cursor: pointer; outline: none; font-family: &quot;AP Serif&quot;; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;"">2017 Trump administration policy</a> that prevented national parks from banning plastic water bottle sales.

The group urged the National Park Service and other agencies to move swiftly to carry out changes in reducing single-use plastics well before 2032.<br/><br/>Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., also urged quicker action to address what he called the plastic pollution crisis. “With everyone – from park rangers to park visitors – doing their part we can get this done before the decade has passed!” Merkley said in a statement.<br/><br/>Merkley, who chairs a Senate Appropriations subcommittee that oversees the Interior Department, is co-sponsor of a bill that would ban the sale of single-use plastic water bottles in national parks.<br/><br/>Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., who co-sponsored the bill in the House, hailed the Interior announcement as “a huge step forward in the effort to protect our environment and its creatures from the damage of single-use plastics.&#39;&#39;<br/><br/>Quigley, who is planning a visit to Yosemite National Park, said he looks forward to learning how the park will implement the new rule.<br/><br/>Oceana said a national poll conducted by Ipsos in November 2021 found that more than 80% of American voters would support a decision by the National Park Service to stop selling and distributing single-use plastics at national parks<br/><br/>Haaland said the plastics order was especially important because less than 10% of plastics ever produced have been recycled, and U.S. recycling rates are falling as China and other countries have stopped accepting U.S. waste.<br/><br/>Interior-managed lands generated nearly 80,000 tons of municipal solid waste in fiscal year 2020, the department said, much of it plastics.<br/><br/>Of the more than 300 million tons of plastic produced every year for use in a wide variety of applications, at least 14 million tons of plastic end up in the ocean every year, and plastic makes up 80% of all marine debris found from surface waters to deep-sea sediments, the department said.<br/><br/>Many marine species ingest or are entangled by plastic debris, causing severe injuries or death, and plastic pollution threatens food safety and quality, human health, coastal tourism and contributes to climate change, the department said.",Matthew Daly | Associated Press,Wed Jun 08 17:27:02 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Johnston is the managing director and general manager of the Boston Harbor Hotel, and chair of the board of directors of the Massachusetts Lodging Association.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1655497288016,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1655497288016,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017b-c0a5-d6e2-ab7b-f9a710e80003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-bf75-d7b2-a199-bf77756d0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-6e96-d4bf-abc3-7fb695ea0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-7352-d23e-a3b7-7f5bb53b0008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-7352-d23e-a3b7-7f5bb4690000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>&quot;There&#39;s a huge amount of tax collected from us as hospitality providers every year that goes into the general fund, and only the tiniest fraction of it — and I really mean the tiniest fraction of it — gets spent on promoting the state for future visits,” Johnston added. “And this has been the case for the longest time. And our hope was that this crisis would bring about a change and a realization that you have to invest to develop future business. But still, it seems that our requests are falling on deaf ears. It&#39;s a real shame. And it leaves us at a great disadvantage to other states.”<br/><br/>Johnston said his five-star hotel in Downtown Boston was in a better position than many, and was weathering the pandemic’s financial downturn relatively well overall. He said they actually had good business last summer, and they are hoping— albeit “sitting on the edge&quot; of their seats — for another strong season.<br/><br/>Still, Johnston said, a general sense of a prospective rosiness for Greater Boston hotels this summer could be misleading.<br/><br/>“For example, if you&#39;re hearing hotels are doing well this week, the U.S. Open is in town, hotels are booked out ... nobody would deny that,” said Johnston. “But just because the hotels are doing well this week doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re necessarily having a great summer or a great 2022. It requires more than just one swallow to make a summer. And that&#39;s part of the problem. You know, you hear these messages that places are doing well, but it&#39;s not across the board and it&#39;s not every week of the year.”",Mark Herz,Fri Jun 17 16:24:59 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,Juneteenth should be widely embraced as a way to discuss our nation’s past,Juneteenth should be widely embraced as a way to discuss our nation’s past,"Just a couple of years ago it was an event most white Americans and a lot of Black Americans had never heard of: Juneteeth or June 19th, the day enslaved Texans finally got the word about the Emancipation Proclamation. It was 1865, two years after President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation. Union Army Major General Gordon Granger issued General Order #3 in Galveston Texas to the 250,000 Black men and women who had only known lives as “property” under a brutal system. There was uncertainty that day about how their former owners would accept the news, but there was also relief and joy. The hopes and dreams of the newly freed that first Freedom Day are the foundation of the Juneteeth observance.<br/><br/>Juneteenth has long been a cultural staple in Texas and in some other local Black communities. It grew from a Texas-wide remembrance and those local events to widespread unofficial observances acknowledged by nearly every state in the country. Last year, President Joe Biden made it official, signing into law Congressional legislation naming Juneteenth as the 12th federal holiday.<br/><br/>In the wake of George Floyd’s murder in 2020, Juneteenth became something else — a significant part of corporate and community efforts for diversity and inclusion. A way into dialogue about ongoing thorny issues of racial justice and the legacy of systemic racism.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1655771888146,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1655771888146,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-808e-dd12-a59b-fbff1b140000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-7b67-dd12-a59b-7bfff0a50002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-71e7-d23e-a3b7-7dff5d180003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-83b1-d23e-a3b7-afbb97fa0027&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-83b1-d23e-a3b7-afbb97280000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>I’ve always appreciated Juneteenth’s history and its expression of African American culture. I’m offended that Juneteenth is also the subject of tacky and disrespectful marketing. Juneteenth ice cream anyone? Walmart debuted its special ice cream to swift and angry backlash. Even TMZ, the C-list entertainment gossip show, recognized the product as “the latest entry to the Tone Deaf Marketing Hall of Fame.” Walmart apologized, shortly after the cancellation of the Juneteenth Soul Food Festival in Arkansas which featured a panel of white judges. I’m too weary to list the myriad other gaffes and missteps.<br/><br/>So, I have mixed feelings about the newfound attention and resultant commercial hoopla that now surrounds Juneteenth. On the one hand, I want to make sure that two years late emancipation is uplifted as the pivotal piece of American history it is. More likely if many decide to honor it every year. On the other hand, I don’t want to lose what made previous Juneteenth celebrations special — the intimacy of the grassroots gatherings featuring commemorative speeches, parades and communal feasts with focused attention on the meaning of the day. And I also don’t want Juneteenth to be thought of as a kind of miracle balm to treat the deep wounds of racial hate.<br/><br/>But I do want it to be an antidote to the venomous racist and false rhetoric against teaching and discussing the truth about nation’s racial past. I take pleasure in knowing that today’s inaugural observances of Juneteenth are in effect overriding legislation shutting down these uncomfortable but necessary conversations. A fitting tribute to those whose journey to emancipation is now stitched into America’s fabric of history.",Callie Crossley,Mon Jun 20 20:38:50 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,Police oversight body says majority of officers up for review will be recertified,Police oversight body says majority of officers up for review will be recertified,"A legal dispute is still playing out in court and the relationship between officers and the state&#39;s new policing oversight body remains tense, but the great majority of officers whose certification runs out at the end of the month are in position to be recertified.<br/><br/>The law that created the Peace Officer Standards and Training Commission certified all officers who completed training by July 1, 2021 and set out the three-year cycle of recertification based on each officer&#39;s last name. All law enforcement officers with last names starting with a letter A through H are supposed to be recertified by July 1, 2022, and the deadline for all agencies to submit information about those officers was June 15.<br/><br/>Of the 439 total law enforcement agencies within POST&#39;s scope, 387 agencies have submitted the required recertification information representing 6,127 officers. That means that the POST Commission now has the information it needs to evaluate more than 70 percent of the law enforcement officers due to be recertified in the first wave under the state&#39;s 2020 policing reform law, Executive Director Enrique Zuniga said Tuesday morning.<br/><br/>In addition to the 6,127 officers for whom required recertification information has been successfully submitted (about 71 percent of the estimated 8,581 officers who are up for recertification at the end of the month), there are another roughly 2,200 officers (about 25 percent) who work for departments that have submitted the names of the officers due for recertification but have been granted 30-day extensions to submit additional information, including the state&#39;s two largest departments: Mass. State Police and Boston Police.<br/><br/>&quot;The number one reason for those requests of extension is that, again, the time that it takes to deploy and do the things that we&#39;re asking people to do, and the availability and things and other work that agencies have to do to try to meet these deadlines,&quot; Zuniga said.<br/><br/>Zuniga said Tuesday that there are also 27 agencies — 16 police departments, nine special State Police officer facilities like colleges or hospitals, and two sheriff&#39;s offices — that have not submitted information on officers in need of recertification and have not asked for an extension.<br/><br/>&quot;These are very small departments, the ones on this list of 27 agencies. It is quite possible that a couple of those may have no officers between A through H, so they&#39;re not out of compliance simply because they&#39;re on that list of no submission,&quot; Zuniga said, adding that the commission has been reaching out to those agencies in recent days.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1655835711385,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1655835711385,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-dd61-ddd0-a5ff-df73c3290003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-6c33-d69c-ade1-fc3bef1a0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-4aa8-d86e-a3e1-4fe8dd650003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-877e-d0e3-afe1-f77e957d000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-877e-d0e3-afe1-f77e94a40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>Of the 6,127 officers for whom the POST Commission has the information it needs to consider recertification, 5,205 officers (85 percent) are on track to be recertified with no exceptions and their certification letters could be sent out by the end of this week, Zuniga said. He said that &quot;at this point, there&#39;s nobody that will be in the category of non-certified,&quot; but he told the POST Commission that the recertification applications of 69 officers (1 percent) &quot;merit further review.&quot;<br/><br/>Another 645 officers (11 percent) are on track to be conditionally recertified, meaning their certification will be contingent upon them taking some type of action within 90 days. Zuniga said the most common reason an officer may be conditionally recertified is that his or her in-service training or CPR certification has lapsed and needs to be brought back up to date.<br/><br/>But there is a subset of those officers (Zuniga did not say how many of the 645) who will be conditionally recertified because the questionnaire that is part of the recertification process — and which is a central part of an ongoing legal dispute between police organizations and the commission — was either not completed or was completed but marked as &quot;with exceptions.&quot;<br/><br/>In some cases, that means that the officer was out on military leave, paternity leave or administrative leave when the questionnaire was to be completed via an interview, Zuniga said, but in some cases the questionnaire was not completed because of a &quot;union concern.&quot; That phrase caught the attention Tuesday of Boston Police Patrolmen&#39;s Association President Larry Calderone, who asked Zuniga to clarify where that concern is coming from.<br/><br/>&quot;There were a couple of agencies that said that their union was concerned about the questionnaire and they did not conduct the questionnaire ... I don&#39;t know any more details than &#39;union concern,&#39; but that&#39;s a direct quote from the explanation they provided,&quot; Zuniga said. &quot;Whatever the concern might be, our position is and will be that they have to go conduct that questionnaire and they will have 90 days to do that.&quot;<br/><br/>As the POST Commission has developed the framework for recertification in recent months, <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2022/04/27/law-enforcement-groups-sue-mass-police-oversight-commission-over-secret-meetings"">the questionnaire has emerged as one of the sticking points for some police officers</a>. A lawsuit filed against the commission in April by the Massachusetts Coalition of Police, Boston Police Superior Officers Federation and Boston Police Detectives Benevolent Society took issue with &quot;a series of highly invasive, improper, unfair, and irrational questionnaires.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;At least four questions clearly violate an officer&#39;s Constitutional rights -- or other legal protections -- if they are required by the POST Commission to answer as a condition of certification. The questions improperly involve matters of free speech and free expression, religious affiliation and religious beliefs, private and personal financial information, and a request for overly vague and undefined personal assessments,&quot; the plaintiffs in the lawsuit said in a statement sent out ahead of Tuesday&#39;s POST Commission meeting. &quot;They also violate core privacy interests of law enforcement officers.&quot;<br/><br/><a href=""https://www.mass.gov/doc/officer-questionnaire-part-2-udpated-4-11-22/download"" style=""color: rgb(0, 106, 199); text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-skip-ink: none;"">The questionnaire</a> includes eight questions, including whether the officer is current on tax payments, has ever had a restraining order taken out against them, has been a civil suit defendant accused of acting violently or abusively, has been licensed to possess a firearm, has been subject to a suspension of more than five days, has made any social media posts or public statements in the last five years that could be perceived as biased, has been part of any group that unlawfully discriminates against people, and whether there is anything else relevant to their &quot;eligibility or fitness to be recertified as a law enforcement officer.&quot;<br/><br/>On Friday, a Superior Court judge held a hearing on the plaintiffs&#39; motion for a preliminary injunction and took the matter under advisement. On Tuesday, the POST Commission ended its public meeting by voting to enter into executive session so its members could privately discuss the legal matter.<br/><br/>&quot;We are hopeful the Court will rule that the Commission&#39;s questions are poorly designed, invalid, and/or likely violations of the Constitution we are sworn to uphold,&quot; the plaintiffs said. &quot;We hope for a favorable ruling to preserve the rights of our police officers and the members of the public. We have been and continue to be supportive of police reform, and we expect it to be done in a legal and thoughtful manner that honors Constitutional obligations.&quot;<br/>",Colin A.

Article,City officials break ground on Carter School building for students with disabilities,City officials break ground on Carter School building for students with disabilities,"When former Principal Marianne Kopaczynski started working at the William E. Carter School in the 1970s, she was told not to unpack supplies from her car because the students and staff moved buildings so much.<br/> <br/>Though the school serves students with complex learning needs and disabilities, it has been operating in a building where wheelchair users cannot pass through all the doorways and where navigating bathrooms can be tricky. So on Tuesday, city officials broke ground on a new building.<br/><br/>The school currently serves 25 students, who range from age 12 to 22. Officials expect that number to grow to 60 with the new building scheduled to open for the 2024-2025 school year. The new building will increase the number of classrooms from five to 12, establish an early childhood program and include a therapeutic pool and sensory garden, which will provide forms of therapy for disabled children. <br/><bsp-module

educators who are pouring their whole hearts and selves into ensuring that we&#39;re giving them every opportunity,” Wu said at the groundbreaking ceremony. “But if you look up from the young people and the educators into the building, then it tells a very different story.”<br/><br/>The new facility, which will cost $92 million, will look very different from when the school got its start.<br/><br/>“We were at Boston State Hospital in an abandoned building with grates on the windows and no equipment,” Kopaczynski said, recalling the school in the 1970s. “We had to bring in our own paper products and scavenge for even a table or chairs.” <br/><br/>Until construction is completed, a portion of Lila Frederick School will temporarily host students and teachers from Carter.

Article,"Politicians urge action at Mass. and Cass, critics call plan 'a complete waste of time'","Politicians urge action at Mass. and Cass, critics call plan 'a complete waste of time'","A group of Massachusetts elected officials are calling on state and local law enforcement to execute a sweep of outstanding criminal warrants and to clear people with mental health issues and substance use disorder from the corridor near Melnea Cass Boulevard and Massachusetts Avenue, known as Mass. and Cass. To address “dangerous, inhumane and unacceptable” conditions in the area, elected officials also requested that authorities involuntarily commit people who are “suffering from mental health and substance abuse with a likelihood of serious harm to themselves or others.” <br/><br/>The letter — signed by Congressman Stephen Lynch, state Sen. Nick Collins, state Rep. David Biele, City Councilor Frank Baker and At-Large City Councilors Michael Flaherty and Erin Murphy — followed a community meeting in South Boston last week, where the elected officials say “serious issues were raised by concerned residents about public safety in South Boston and across the city,” emphasizing issues with human trafficking, drug trafficking and guns. <br/><br/>Sergeant Detective John Boyle, a spokesman for the Boston Police Department, said officers will continue to serve warrants in the area but they are not planning for a sweep. Mass. and Cass is regularly monitored by outreach teams from the city, security guards and teams of Boston Police officers, according to Boyle.<br/><br/>After a series of stabbings and other crime in the area in April, the Engagement Center on Atkinson Street — which was created to support those experiencing homelessness or seeking substance use treatment — was closed for five days. Since then, the Center has not operated at full capacity, and crowding on Atkinson Street has been prohibited. Crowds have gravitated toward Southampton Street, a more visible, highly trafficked area near several highway onramps. <br/><br/>“When people are more visible, that’s when they call for the removal, that’s when people complain about crowds hanging around,” said Heidi King, who experienced homelessness for over a decade at Mass. and Cass and returns for regular clinic appointments. “They don’t care about us, they’re just trying to remove us because they think we’re the problem.” <br/><br/>King says additional warrant sweeps are unlikely to reduce crime unless authorities become more actively engaged with the situation on the ground. She said she was assaulted by a man on Atkinson Street last summer and saw no police intervention. “They literally just stand there and just watch the time go by and get paid for nothing,” said King. <br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1655843728072,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1655843728072,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;Related Stories:&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-293e-d82a-af7c-ebff014d0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-dbe5-dd5c-ad7f-fbed56100003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-4460-d0ab-a17d-4effdc5d0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-29fb-d269-a3fd-bffb5f4f0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-87db-d4bf-abc3-bfff12cd0008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-87db-d4bf-abc3-bfff10180000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>Chrissy Joubert, an activist who has spent over seven years working with the homeless community on Mass. and Cass through her nonprofit Project Do Something Boston, agrees that police have a responsibility to protect not just the residents and businesses in the surrounding community, but unhoused victims of predators at Mass. and Cass as well. She says getting victims away from the area — into housing, detox or low-threshold safe houses for victims of domestic violence — would solve a lot of the concentrated crime.<br/><br/>“There are always going to be these people around, there’s crime all over the city, but when it’s near the South End, people blame the homeless,” Joubert said. “We need for the victims to be safe. If there&#39;s no victim, there&#39;s no people to prey on.” <br/><br/>Last month, Mayor Michelle Wu announced a “comprehensive <a href=""https://www.boston.gov/news/mayor-wu-provides-updates-city-efforts-mass-and-cass"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">warm weather plan</a>” to prevent another encampment from forming in the area this summer. The plan includes efforts to reduce crowds, clean up surrounding streets and continue to connect people experiencing homelessness, substance use disorders and mental health issues with resources and detox programs. Additional security measures will also be taken to “promote [a] safe environment for accessing services at [the] Engagement Center,” though the center will operate on a limited basis, according to Wu. <br/><br/>The plan is an extension of the Wu administration’s efforts to secure temporary or permanent housing for people experiencing homelessness at Mass. and Cass, culminating in a sweep of the area in January. Though an estimated 164 people were moved into transitional housing in the weeks following the sweep, <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2022/02/28/a-broken-promise-six-weeks-after-city-sweep-of-mass-and-cass-many-still-dont-have-a-place-to-go"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">an estimated 100 others were left behind</a> with no housing.<br/><br/>As part of the city’s new plan, six low-threshold housing sites that were established last January will continue to operate while the city works to create permanent locations, according to a press release from the city. <br/><br/>&quot;We reiterate the need for partnership across the state and the region as we seek to expand temporary and permanent supportive housing beyond Boston,&quot; Wu told reporters last month. &quot;Additionally, we are looking to decentralize these services and ensure resources are available across our communities, not just in one part of the city.&quot;<br/><br/><i>Produced with assistance from the <a href=""https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpmja.org%2Fpmja-editor-corps%2F&amp;data=05%7C01%7Csmccloskey%40vpm.org%7C98abd9fd95a2484bc57708da22495561%7Ca9b814cd8a9542789b5a7a9b68ebf5c1%7C0%7C0%7C637859995627735225%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C2000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=hif8N4HHCK%2BIPZlnd25dGv9puD%2B5VZ3ervIq7bCatIk%3D&amp;reserved=0"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">Public Media Journalists Association Editor Corps</a> funded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a private corporation funded by the American people.</i>",Tori Bedford,Tue Jun 21 16:43:58 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,Rep. Pressley and Sen. Warren renew calls to cancel student debt,Rep. Pressley and Sen. Warren renew calls to cancel student debt,"Rep. Ayanna Pressley and Sen. Elizabeth Warren renewed their calls Wednesday for President Joe Biden to cancel student debt. They joined union leaders and borrowers for a roundtable hosted by the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations.<br/><br/>“This is an impactful issue for people from every walk of life,” Pressley said, responding to criticisms that debt cancellation would benefit those already well off. “For our elders who cannot retire because they took out Parent PLUS loans and they are still paying on those loans. For our young teachers who cannot pay the monthly minimum because they are also struggling to pay for childcare, for the service worker who feels that they will never get back on their feet because they have gone into default.”<br/><br/>The White House has long maintained that its ability to act is limited without Congressional approval. Advocates argue Biden could cancel student debt through an executive order. At the beginning of June, Biden canceled $5.8 billion in debt for half a million former students of the now-defunct <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2022/06/02/1101424651/corinthian-colleges-student-loan-forgiveness"" style=""text-decoration: none;"">for-profit Corinthian Colleges.</a> He was also said to be considering a broader forgiveness of <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/05/27/biden-student-debt-borrower/"" style=""text-decoration: none;"">$10,000 per borrower</a>, which has yet to come. <br/><br/>Pressley and Warren want to see Biden relieve $50,000 per borrower, which Pressley framed as a racial justice issue in addition to a labor issue. “Policies like redlining are forcing us to take on higher student debt loads than our white peers just for a shot at a college degree,” she said. “We&#39;ve been told we live in a meritocracy. We&#39;ve been told that education is the great equalizer. … This has only exacerbated and grown the racial wealth gap.”<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1655923100968,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1655923100968,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-711b-dd12-a59b-7bfbd9d20000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-85b4-dd12-a59b-ffff928b0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017f-e4c8-df38-a17f-f5e9472c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-8cb3-d23e-a3b7-adbb00f80019&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-8cb3-d23e-a3b7-adbb002c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>Pressley credited a diverse coalition, including union workers, for bringing the issue to the fore. “We owe it to the millions of union workers who have kept our nation running during these unprecedented, challenging times,” she said. “Student debt cancellation is core to any just and equitable economic recovery from this pandemic.” <br/><br/>Warren also framed the student debt crisis as a labor issue and highlighted the importance of strong unions: “Unions lift the voices of working people across this nation, and at this moment, tens of millions of Americans turn to our unions saying, ‘Lift my voice. Help us with this student loan debt.’”<br/><br/>At the roundtable, Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, recalled polling her members about the core issues affecting them. “Normally this polling is confidential,” she said. “I had to break confidentiality. Why? Because the polling was about student debt, and several people who responded talked about how suicidal they were. … They talked about how they couldn&#39;t make ends meet and the shame of having student debt.”<br/><br/>Like Pressley, Warren pushed back against critics arguing debt cancellation will benefit the rich. “This is an issue that affects hard-working people, people who try, people who work two jobs and three jobs, people who start, and maybe it doesn&#39;t work out the first time, but they want to come back and try again,” she said. <br/><br/>She pointed to her own history as a motivator for her efforts to cancel student debt; she attended University of Houston for $50 per semester while working part-time to cover the cost. <br/><br/>“Why was that opportunity out there? Because we made the decisions together to invest in the future of our children, not just the children born into wealthy families,” Warren said. Today, she said, things have changed. <br/><br/>“$1.7 trillion of student loan debt did not just fall out of the sky,” she said. “It happened because of deliberate policy decisions to make investments in cutting taxes for the richest Americans and paying for it by shortchanging the education of our children.”<br/><br/>Speaking to Biden, Warren said that if the president cares about labor, he should take action. “Today would be a good day to cancel $50,000 in student loan debt,” she said. “This is the beauty of an action that the president can take all on his own. … All the Republicans can do right now is lie and hope that they can dissuade the president from doing what is right for working people.”",Rebecca Tauber,Wed Jun 22 14:39:22 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They say they often must deal with people who are mentally ill, have substance use disorders and are homeless, and that the people they encounter can become aggressive at times.

They began to seriously consider unionizing after the T’s board of directors balked at agreeing to a new $102 million contract, on which MyDatt was the lone bidder.<br/><br/>A small group of ambassadors has filed what’s called a formal notice of representation with the National Labor Relations Board. If they can get 30% of their 200 colleagues to sign on, that will trigger an election which they hope to have in late August.<br/><br/>This is the second effort underway to organize the MBTA&#39;s Transit Ambassadors. The Machinists Union Local Lodge 264 — which is comprised of more than 400 mechanics, fuelers and other professionals at the MBTA — said they had already been working to include the ambassadors in their union. Spokesman Michael Vartabedian said the union declared in December 2020 that they would start a campaign to organize the ambassadors who work for the company Block by Block, a subsidiary of MyDatt Corporation, but they put the campaign on hold because many ambassadors quit and lead organizer for the campaign was dealing with health complications. The machinists union says its goal over the next few weeks is to get a majority of support from the MBTA Transit Ambassadors and then also file for an election. <br/><br/>The machinists union said it was previously unaware of the new unionization effort. Members of Transit Ambassadors United say they started their own campaign because they weren’t seeing any results from the machinists union’s effort.<br/><br/>The Transit Ambassador program was launched in 2017, and the initial contract with MyDatt Services is set to expire at the end of this month. Although MBTA officials said they notified more than 200 vendors about bidding on a new five-year contract, only two companies showed any interest, and MyDatt was the only company to submit a bid.<br/><br/>T ambassadors say they would prefer to be MBTA employees to receive better pay and benefits. But General Manager Stephen Poftak says he would prefer their services to be contracted out considering how difficult it has been for the agency to hire any new workers.<br/><br/><i>Produced with assistance from the <a href=""https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpmja.org%2Fpmja-editor-corps%2F&amp;data=05%7C01%7Csmccloskey%40vpm.org%7C98abd9fd95a2484bc57708da22495561%7Ca9b814cd8a9542789b5a7a9b68ebf5c1%7C0%7C0%7C637859995627735225%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C2000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=hif8N4HHCK%2BIPZlnd25dGv9puD%2B5VZ3ervIq7bCatIk%3D&amp;reserved=0"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">Public Media Journalists Association Editor Corps</a> funded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a private corporation funded by the American people.</i><br/><br/><i>This story was updated to include details on the machinists union effort.</i>",Bob Seay,Wed Jun 22 17:42:17 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Massachusetts’ current laws similarly restrict gun carrying under a statute that gives local police chiefs power to deny licenses if they deem applicants “unsuitable.”<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1656012073145,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1656012073145,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-89c8-dd12-a59b-fbfb28090000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-5e8d-db90-a1eb-5fbff2f70003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-728e-d23e-a3b7-7f9f43bf0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-9202-d23e-a3b7-bf1b796c0015&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-9202-d23e-a3b7-bf1b793d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>“This decision puts that statute in jeopardy,” said Daniel Medwed, a Northeastern University law professor and GBH News legal analyst. <br/><br/>Massachusetts has the second-lowest rate of death by firearm in the country, according to <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/firearm_mortality/firearm.htm"" target=""_blank"">data from the Centers for Disease Control.</a> New York also sits low on the list with the fifth-lowest rate of gun deaths as of 2020. <br/><br/>While the ruling directly affects New York, Medwed said he expects to see gun license applicants in Massachusetts begin to challenge state restrictions based on the Supreme Court ruling. Still, he thinks legislators will attempt to amend Massachusetts laws to keep them legal and create more objective criteria about applicants’ suitability to stay consistent with the ruling. <br/><br/>Lawrence Chief of Police Roy Vasque told GBH News he worries about not having discretion in who receives licenses.<br/><br/>“I have my situations where I deny licenses, where we revoke licenses and we deal with appeals of those as well, so it&#39;s not uncommon. It happens,” he said. “But I think Massachusetts requiring a license to carry a firearm and getting a license in order to carry that in public, I think is a good thing. I think basing those on factors like criminal history and even mental history and things like that I think is a no-brainer. So certainly it&#39;s concerning that some changes may result in that as a result of this ruling.”<br/><br/>“With all the gun violence in the world and some of the spikes that have happened, I&#39;m kind of amazed, I guess, or stunned that this would have happened in this timeline,” Vasque added. <br/><br/>The Supreme Court’s decision comes as the Senate <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/21/us/politics/senate-gun-safety-bill.html?searchResultPosition=1"" target=""_blank"">is advancing a bipartisan gun bill</a>, and in the wake of mass shootings in Buffalo, N.Y., Uvalde, Texas and elsewhere across the country.<br/><br/>Interim Suffolk County District Attorney Kevin Hayden came out against the decision Thursday. “I stand with my colleagues in New York and across the country in expressing grave concern about the impact of today’s Supreme Court gun decision,” he said. “It’s ironic, and perhaps tragic, that just as the nation’s top legislative body is formulating sensible firearm regulations, its top judicial body is undoing them.”<br/><br/>Attorney General Maura Healey, U.S. Rep. Katherine Clark and Sen. Ed Markey also criticized the decision. <br/><br/>“We know concealed weapons near schools or on street corners across Massachusetts — or anywhere in our country — won’t make parents or their children feel any safer,” Markey said in a statement. “The Supreme Court has now placed the safety of these families at risk.”<br/><br/>The ruling worries gun control advocates, many of whom see the Supreme Court as an increasingly politicized branch.<br/><br/>“We have an activist court there making up the rules as they go,” said John Rosenthal, co-founder of the Boston-based group Stop Handgun Violence. “They don&#39;t represent the majority of Americans that support common sense gun laws and they&#39;re dismantling them. In Massachusetts it’s going to have an impact. It&#39;s going to make it easier for people who shouldn&#39;t have guns to get them.”<br/><br/>For Second Amendment proponents, the ruling comes as a win. “We are really excited, today&#39;s an important day for civil rights in this country,” said Jim Wallace, executive director of Gun Owners’ Action League, a Massachusetts-based advocacy group on behalf of gun owners. “It&#39;s going to be one more decision we have that&#39;s kind of going to force Massachusetts to recognize the Second Amendment as an individual civil right, which it really has not historically.”<br/><br/>In June, The New York Times identified <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/06/04/upshot/mass-shooting-gun-laws.html"" target=""_blank"">35 U.S. mass shootings since 1999</a> in which the stricter gun control legislation in front of the Senate might have made a difference, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/25/world/europe/gun-laws-australia-britain.html?searchResultPosition=15"" target=""_blank"">other countries</a> have seen decreases in gun-related deaths after passing gun restrictions. While the bill poised to pass the Senate does not go as far as many Democrats want, it breaks years of inaction on gun control due to Republican opposition. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court ruling is the first case concerning gun laws taken up by the highest court since 2008.<br/><br/>Wallace wants to see gun violence tackled as a criminal justice and mental health problem targeting individual offenders, instead of through gun control legislation. Rosenthal, who is also a gun owner, thinks the ruling will lead to more deaths.<br/><br/>“In all likelihood, Massachusetts and all the states that have tougher gun laws and lower gun death rates will see a change, and will see more gun injuries and deaths as a result of this outrageous decision by the Supreme Court,” Rosenthal said.",Rebecca Tauber,Thu Jun 23 16:14:33 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade,Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court has ended constitutional protections for abortion that had been in place nearly 50 years in a decision by its conservative majority to overturn <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/what-is-roe-v-wade-33c08858dc8b0aa5f0450858b51a648a"" target=""_blank"">Roe v. Wade</a>. Friday&#39;s outcome is expected to lead to abortion bans in roughly half the states.<br/><br/>The decision, unthinkable just a few years ago, was the culmination of decades of efforts by abortion opponents, made possible by an emboldened right side of the court that has been fortified by three appointees of former President Donald Trump.<br/><br/>The ruling came more than a month after the stunning <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-07439f9fc4542f1500ab78dfd34036b1"" target=""_blank"">leak of a draft opinion</a> by Justice Samuel Alito indicating the court was prepared to take this momentous step.<br/><br/>It puts the court at odds with a majority of Americans who favored preserving Roe, according to opinion polls.<br/><br/>Alito, in the final opinion issued Friday, wrote that Roe and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the 1992 decision that reaffirmed the right to abortion, were wrong the day they were decided and must be overturned.<br/><br/>“We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled. The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision,” Alito wrote.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1656087249647,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1656087249647,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-9669-d0e3-afe1-f66faee50003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-820f-dab0-a57d-ef1f8c910003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-99ec-d08c-a5cc-99fdd11f0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-f702-d0cd-a1ff-ff3a2e4d0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-b36b-d08c-a5cc-b3ff6f390000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-9623-d4bf-abc3-bf2776bb000d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-9623-d4bf-abc3-bf27759a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>Authority to regulate abortion rests with the political branches, not the courts, Alito wrote.<br/><br/>Joining Alito were Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.

Another half-dozen states have near-total bans or prohibitions after 6 weeks of pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant.<br/><br/>In roughly a half-dozen other states, the fight will be over dormant abortion bans that were enacted before Roe was decided in 1973 or new proposals to sharply limit when abortions can be performed, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.<br/><br/>More than 90% of abortions take place in the first 13 weeks of pregnancy, and more than half are now done with pills, not surgery, according to data compiled by Guttmacher.<br/><br/>The decision came against a backdrop of public opinion surveys that find a majority of Americans oppose overturning Roe and handing the question of whether to permit abortion entirely to the states. Polls conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and others also have consistently shown about 1 in 10 Americans want abortion to be illegal in all cases. A majority are in favor of abortion being legal in all or most circumstances, but polls indicate many also support restrictions especially later in pregnancy.<br/><br/>The Biden administration and other defenders of abortion rights have warned that a decision overturning Roe also would threaten other high court decisions in favor of gay rights and even potentially, contraception.<br/><br/>But Alito wrote in his draft opinion that his analysis addresses abortion only, not other rights that also stem from a right to privacy that the high court has found implicit, though not directly stated, in the Constitution. Abortion is different, Alito wrote, because of the unique moral question it poses.<br/><br/>Whatever the intentions of the person who leaked Alito’s draft opinion, the conservatives held firm in overturning Roe and Casey.<br/><br/>In his draft, Alito dismissed the arguments in favor of retaining the two decisions, including that multiple generations of American women have partly relied on the right to abortion to gain economic and political power.<br/><br/>Changing the composition of the court has been central to the anti-abortion side’s strategy. Mississippi and its allies made increasingly aggressive arguments as the case developed, and two high-court defenders of abortion rights retired or died. The state initially argued that its law could be upheld without overruling the court’s abortion precedents.<br/><br/>Then-Gov. Phil Bryant signed the 15-week measure into law in March 2018, when Justices Anthony Kennedy and Ruth Bader Ginsburg were still members of a five-justice majority that was mainly protective of abortion rights.<br/><br/>By early summer, Kennedy had retired and was replaced by Justice Brett Kavanaugh a few months later. The Mississippi law was blocked in lower federal courts.<br/><br/>But the state always was headed to the nation’s highest court. It did not even ask for a hearing before a three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which ultimately held the law invalid in December 2019.<br/><br/>By early September 2020, the Supreme Court was ready to consider the state’s appeal.<br/><br/>The court scheduled the case for consideration at the justices’ private conference on Sept. 29. But in the intervening weeks, Ginsburg died and Barrett was quickly nominated and confirmed without a single Democratic vote.<br/><br/>The stage now was set, although it took the court another half year to agree to hear the case.<br/><br/>By the time Mississippi filed its main written argument with the court in the summer, the thrust of its argument had changed and it was now calling for the wholesale overruling of Roe and Casey.<br/><br/>The first sign that the court might be receptive to wiping away the constitutional right to abortion came in late summer, when the justices divided 5-4 in allowing Texas to enforce a ban on the procedure at roughly six weeks, before some women even know they are pregnant. That dispute turned on the unique structure of the law, including its enforcement by private citizens rather than by state officials, and how it can be challenged in court.<br/><br/>But Justice Sonia Sotomayor noted in a searing dissent for the three liberal justices that their conservative colleagues refused to block “a flagrantly unconstitutional law” that “flouts nearly 50 years of federal precedents.” Roberts was also among the dissenters.<br/><br/>Then in December, after hearing additional arguments over whether to block the Texas law known as S.B. 8, the court again declined to do so, also by a 5-4 vote. “The clear purpose and actual effect of S. B. 8 has been to nullify this Court’s rulings,” Roberts wrote, in a partial dissent.<br/><br/>In their Senate hearings, Trump’s three high-court picks carefully skirted questions about how they would vote in any cases, including about abortion.<br/><br/>But even as Democrats and abortion rights supporters predicted Kavanaugh and Gorsuch would vote to upend abortion rights if confirmed, the two left at least one Republican senator with a different impression. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine predicted Gorsuch and Kavanaugh wouldn’t support overturning the abortion cases, based on private conversations she had with them when they were nominees to the Supreme Court.<br/><br/>Barrett was perhaps the most vocal opponent of abortion in her time as a law professor, before becoming a federal judge in 2017. She was a member of anti-abortion groups at Notre Dame University, where she taught law, and she signed a newspaper ad opposing “abortion on demand” and defending “the right to life from fertilization to natural death.” She promised to set aside her personal views when judging cases.<br/><br/>Trump, meanwhile, had predicted as a candidate that whoever he named to the court would “automatically” vote to overrule Roe.<br/>",Associated Press,Fri Jun 24 10:33:58 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Article,Too many people have decided the pandemic is over,Too many people have decided the pandemic is over,"During some recent travel, I had a chance to get an up close look at the fractured nature of our national consciousness about COVID-19. In my world, friends and colleagues are just now gradually meeting in person, and all of them routinely test for COVID as a precaution. But outside the parameters of my world, everybody seems to be acting as though the pandemic is behind us. <br/><br/>For one thing, nobody seems to mind being on top of each other in public spaces. I’m extremely uncomfortable just watching all those yelling and screaming fans at the large sports events, all of them sitting close to each other. My attempts to social distance have often turned into a not-so-comic version of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRZ5RpsytRA"" target=""_blank"">the iconic “close talker” episode from the 1990’s TV comedy &quot;Seinfeld.&quot;</a> Just like the Seinfeld character, the folks near me react to my attempt to create space by physically stepping back, as a cue to move closer. <br/><br/>And if what I saw is the norm, masks are pretty much a relic of the near past. Most communities — including my hometown Cambridge — have ended mask mandates. Still, there are plenty of us continuing to mask up. But, elsewhere, I am one of the few — sometimes the only — person anywhere in sight who is wearing a mask. <br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1656169184658,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1656169184658,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-bee2-d7b2-a199-bfe3b70f0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-a941-d425-a995-fbefa8760003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-e34f-df1e-a1fa-fbffc0110003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-9b5f-d0e3-afe1-fb7f4df70024&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-9b5f-d0e3-afe1-fb7f4d1a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>In Washington, D.C., last month I was relieved that many businesses I visited had signs indicating masks were required inside, even though the district officially dropped its mask mandate in March. Last week, as I stopped through airports in North Carolina and Texas, I could easily count the small number of mask wearers. I documented maybe ten at any given point. In North Carolina, I watched as passengers lined up for their flight to Grand Cayman in the Caribbean. Before the boarding began, the gate agent repeated <i>four </i>times that the requirements for that particular flight were passports and masks. At the boarding door, all had passports at the ready, few were wearing their masks. From what I observed, it was not an act of defiance, the passengers immediately complied after being reminded — again. Clearly, they were so done with wearing a mask, they literally could not hear the word.  <br/><br/>Yet it was just last month that the country reached a grim milestone: one million deaths from COVID-19. Even if many of us have dismissed the reality, COVID remains a real health threat. I don’t need to be reminded — too many of friends and acquaintances, who have been extremely careful, have gotten Covid. So has the super cautious Dr. Anthony Fauci, the chief medical advisor to President Joe Biden. I’m holding my breath knowing my time is no doubt inevitable. <br/><br/>Even in China, where an authoritarian lockdown in Shanghai was recently successful in stamping out COVID cases, the government has documented a new outbreak and is reinstating COVID-19 restrictions. <br/><br/>Too many people have misinterpreted “living with COVID” to mean returning to a pre-COVID time when there was no pandemic. It really means daily vigilance against an ever-mutating, life-threatening virus. Believe me, I am COVID-weary too, but a rush to some imagined finish line is not the way.

Article,Lawyer charged with trying to bribe Medford cop in marijuana case,Lawyer charged with trying to bribe Medford cop in marijuana case,"BOSTON (AP) — A Massachusetts lawyer has pleaded not guilty to federal charges he tried to bribe the Medford police chief to get help in opening a recreational marijuana dispensary on behalf of a client.<br/><br/>Court records say that Somerville attorney Sean O’Donovan, 54, pleaded not guilty in federal court on Friday to three counts stemming from his efforts to win an agreement that would allow the client to open a marijuana dispensary in Medford. He was released.<br/><br/>The client was unaware of O&#39;Donovan&#39;s efforts, the Justice Department said in a Friday news release announcing the charges.<br/><br/>“Mr. O’Donovan did not bribe a public official, he did not discuss bribing a public official, and that the charges against him constitute an unprecedented extension of federal criminal law that we intend to vigorously challenge in the courtroom,” O&#39;Donovan&#39;s attorney Martin Weinberg said in a Saturday email.<br/><br/>Prosecutors say that in February 2021, O’Donovan approached a “close relative” of the Medford police chief and offered to pay $25,000 to speak with the chief about the client’s anticipated application to open a marijuana business in Medford. The chief immediately alerted federal authorities.<br/><br/>Prosecutors say that over the next few months O&#39;Donovan met with the relative, described in court papers as Individual 1, to discuss the plan.<br/><br/>“The only problem for Mr. O’Donovan is the FBI was listening in on every single one of those meetings he had with Individual One,” First Assistant United States Attorney Joshua Levy told reporters on Friday.",Associated Press,Sun Jun 26 07:43:53 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,Pride parades march on with new urgency across US,Pride parades march on with new urgency across US,"NEW YORK (AP) — Pride parades kicked off in New York City and around the country Sunday with glittering confetti, cheering crowds, fluttering rainbow flags and newfound fears about losing freedoms won through decades of activism.<br/><br/>The annual marches in New York, San Francisco, Chicago and elsewhere took place just two days after one conservative justice on the Supreme Court signaled, <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2022/06/25/the-supreme-courts-majority-and-dissent-opinions-on-dobbs-reveal-a-massive-schism"">in a ruling on abortion</a>, that the court should reconsider the right to same-sex marriage recognized in 2015.<br/><br/>“We’re here to make a statement,&quot; said 31-year-old Mercedes Sharpe, who traveled to Manhattan from Massachusetts. “I think it’s about making a point, rather than all the other years like how we normally celebrate it. This one’s really gonna stand out. I think a lot of angry people, not even just women, angry men, angry women.&quot;<br/><br/>Thousands of people — many decked in pride colors — lined the parade route through Manhattan, cheering as floats and marchers passed by. Organizers announced this weekend that a Planned Parenthood contingent would be at the front of the parade.<br/><br/>In Chicago, Mayor Lori Lightfoot called the top court ruling a “momentary setback” and said Sunday’s events were “an opportunity for us to not only celebrate Pride, but be resolved for the fight.”<br/><br/>“We will not live in a world, not in my city, where our rights are taken from us or rolled back,” said Lightfoot, Chicago’s first openly gay mayor, and the first Black woman to hold the office.<br/><br/>In San Francisco, some marchers and spectators held signs condemning the court’s abortion ruling. U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who rode in a convertible holding a gavel and a rainbow fan, said the large turnout was an acknowledgement that Americans support gay rights.<br/><br/>“Even in spite of the majority on the court that’s anti our Constitution, our country knows and loves our LGBTQI+ community,” she told KGO-TV.<br/><br/>The warning shot from the nation&#39;s top court came after a year of legislative defeats for the LGBTQ community, including the passage of laws in some states limiting the discussion of sexual orientation or gender identity with children.<br/><br/>As anti-gay sentiments resurface, some are pushing for the parades to return to their roots — less blocks-long street parties, more overtly civil rights marches.<br/><br/>“It has gone from being a statement of advocacy and protest to being much more of a celebration of gay life,” Sean Clarkin, 67, said of New York City&#39;s annual parade while enjoying a drink recently at Julius&#39;, one of the oldest gay bars in Manhattan&#39;s Greenwich Village.<br/><br/>As he remembers things, the parade was once about defiance and pushing against an oppressive mainstream that saw gays, lesbians and transgender people as unworthy outsiders.<br/><br/>“As satisfying and empowering as it may be to now be accepted by the mainstream,” Clarkin said, “there was also something energizing and wonderful about being on the outside looking in.”<br/><br/>New York&#39;s first Pride March, then called the Christopher Street Liberation Day March, was held in 1970 to mark the first anniversary of the Stonewall rebellion, a spontaneous street uprising triggered by a police raid on a gay bar in Manhattan.<br/><br/>San Francisco&#39;s first march was in 1972 and had been held every year since, except during the last two years of the COVID-19 pandemic.<br/><br/>Celebrations are now global, taking place throughout the year in multiple countries, with many of the biggest parades taking place in June. One of the world&#39;s largest, in Sao Paulo, Brazil, was held June 19.<br/><br/>In the United States, this year&#39;s celebrations take place amid a potential crisis.<br/><br/>In a Supreme Court ruling Friday striking down the right to abortion, Justice Clarence Thomas said in a concurring opinion that the court <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/abortion-us-supreme-court-health-government-and-politics-marriage-a0cee537c6f9f10d29fa71f6e7a4d19d"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; color: var(--linkLightColor); text-decoration: none; background-color: transparent; font-size: inherit; cursor: pointer; outline: none; font-family: &quot;AP Serif&quot;; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;"">should also reconsider</a> its 2015 decision legalizing same-sex marriage and a 2003 decision striking down laws criminalizing gay sex.<br/><br/>New York City parade spectator Jackie English said she and her fiancee Dana had yet to set a wedding date, but have a new sense of urgency.<br/><br/>“Now we feel a bit pressured,&quot; she said, adding they might “jump the gun a little sooner. Because, what if that right gets taken away from us?”<br/><br/>More than a dozen states have recently enacted laws that go against the interests of LGBTQ communities, including a law barring any mention of sexual orientation in school curricula in Florida and threats of prosecution for parents who allow their children to get gender-affirming care in Texas.<br/><br/>Several states have put laws in place prohibiting transgender athletes from participating in team sports that coincide with the gender in which they identify.<br/><br/>According to an Anti-Defamation League survey released earlier this week, members of LGBTQ communities were more likely than any other group to experience harassment. Two-thirds of respondents said they have been harassed, a little more than half of whom said the harassment was a result of their sexual orientation.<br/><br/>In recent years, schisms over how to commemorate Stonewall have opened, spawning splinter groups events intended to be more protest-oriented.<br/><br/>In New York City, the Queer Liberation March takes place at the same time as the traditional parade, billing itself as the “antidote to the corporate-infused, police-entangled, politician-heavy Parades that now dominate pride celebrations.&quot;<br/><br/>San Francisco&#39;s parade was marked by the return of uniformed police, who were banned in 2020 after a 2019 confrontation with protesters who staged a parade-stopping sit-in. Critics accused them of using excessive force. On Sunday, San Francisco Police Chief William Scott, in full dress uniform, passed out small rainbow pride flags to spectators.<br/><br/>Despite the criticism of growing commercialism, a strong streak of activism was apparent among attendees this year.<br/><br/>“The recent overturning of Roe v. Wade has caused a very strong uproar about what went down,&quot; said Dean Jigarjian, 22, who crossed the river from New Jersey with his girlfriend to take part in the New York City parade. “So as you can see here, the crowd seems to be very energized about what could be next.”<br/>",Sara Burnett and Robert Jablon | Associated Press,Sun Jun 26 20:12:56 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,President Biden backs a filibuster exception to protect abortion access,President Biden backs a filibuster exception to protect abortion access,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden said Thursday that he would support an exception to the Senate filibuster to protect access to abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.<br/><br/>&quot;If the filibuster gets in the way, it&#39;s like voting rights,&quot; Biden said during a press conference in Madrid, where he was attending a NATO summit. The Democratic president said there should be an &quot;exception to the filibuster for this action to deal with the Supreme Court decision.&quot;<br/><br/>As a former senator, Biden has been reluctant to support changes to the filibuster, which allows any member of the 100-member chamber to block action on legislation unless it receives 60 votes. However, earlier this year he endorsed sidestepping the rule on the issue of voting rights, and his latest comments make clear that he&#39;s willing to do the same for abortion.<br/><br/>Biden&#39;s support for changes to the filibuster in the 50-50 Senate may ultimately be immaterial. The Senate Democratic caucus would need to unanimously take such a step, but at least two Democratic senators, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, don&#39;t want to.<br/><br/>The president has been under pressure to take as much executive action as possible to protect abortion rights, although his options are limited. Biden said he&#39;s meeting Friday with governors to talk about abortion and &quot;I&#39;ll have announcements to make then.&quot;<br/><br/>During Thursday&#39;s news conference, Biden harshly criticized the Supreme Court&#39;s decision on abortion and reiterated his warnings that other constitutional protections could be at risk.<br/><br/>&quot;One thing that has been destabilizing is the outrageous behavior of the Supreme Court of the United States in overruling not only Roe v. Wade but essentially challenging the right to privacy,&quot; he said.<br/><br/>Voting legislation that Democrats and civil rights leaders said was vital to protecting democracy collapsed in January when Manchin and Sinema refused to join their own party in changing Senate rules to overcome a Republican filibuster. The outcome was a stinging defeat for Biden and his party, coming at the tumultuous close to his first year in office.<br/><br/>",CHRIS MEGERIAN Associated Press,Thu Jun 30 10:33:44 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not this year. Prices for the traditional cookout items have spiked, according to <a href=""https://politicalcalculations.blogspot.com/2022/06/2022-cost-of-fourth-of-july-summer.html#.Yr89J5PMJ6o"" target=""_blank"">a new study from the Political Calculations blog</a>. The survey compared Walmart’s grocery prices to last year’s retail costs. Last year, 2 pounds of ground beef cost $8.20 — now the cost is up nearly a buck at $9.14. 1 pound of sliced cheese also costs nearly a dollar more at $4.98, up from last year’s $4.05. A package of eight hamburger buns stands at $2.58; it was $1.66 last year. And at $7.44, a half-gallon of vanilla ice cream is 58% higher than 2021’s $4.69. <br/><br/>All of us may be feeling the pinch of inflation, but it’s a sure bet that many July 4th revelers will eat the extra costs and party on. Other folks I know planned for smaller gatherings, cutting way back on food and guests. <br/><br/>Either way, a cookout is not in the plans for an increasing number of Massachusetts residents who don’t know when or if they will get their next meal.<br/><br/>On this food-focused holiday, I’m thinking about the 1.8 million people in this state who are food insecure. I know the exact number because of a recent survey by the Greater Boston Food Bank. GBF Bank President Catherine D’Amato told the Boston Globe it was a “frightening statistic.” The survey also revealed that most of those going hungry are Latinx, Black and Asian. Many have turned to food banks for help, even though they are working. Inflation has turned former food bank donors into clients. And ironically just as the need is greater, food banks are juggling worker shortages, fewer donations, and higher transportation costs. I keep thinking about the hungry children in<br/><br/>Massachusetts, the ones who live in 40% of the households with children.<br/><br/>Cutbacks of federal and state food programs have put pressure on the food banks to meet the growing need. But it’s too big a problem, and there’s no immediate sign of Congress stepping in. But as they say, every little bit helps. There is a moral obligation for those of us privileged to have full home pantries. I like the practical perspective of Mother Teresa, the Catholic Saint who said, “If you can&#39;t feed a hundred people, then feed just one.” I’m sending in my donation, and you?",Callie Crossley,Mon Jul 04 05:00:41 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,Seven police officers not being recertified under Massachusetts' new standards,Seven police officers not being recertified under Massachusetts' new standards,"Out of more than 8,500 law enforcement officers who must meet the state&#39;s new policing standards by Friday, at least seven will not be approved for recertification by the new Peace Officer Standards and Training Commission and could be barred from the profession in Massachusetts.<br/><br/>Executive Director Enrique Zuniga said Thursday morning that the POST Commission has the necessary information to process recertification applications for 6,366 of the 8,567 officers whose certifications expire as of July 1, and another 2,181 officers are under an extension for their agencies. Zuniga said the commission estimates there are 20 officers up for recertification who work for agencies that have not properly applied for an extension.<br/><br/>Of the 6,366 officers whose recertification applications are ready to be processed, 5,606 or 88 percent will be recertified and 693 or about 11 percent are on track to be recertified with some minor conditions. The recertification applications of 60 officers will need further review, Zuniga said, and seven will not be recertified. Departments will be informed of the recertification status of their officers Friday.<br/><br/>The law that created the POST Commission certified all officers who completed training by July 1, 2021 and set out a three-year cycle of recertification based on each officer&#39;s last name. All law enforcement officers with last names starting with letters A through H are supposed to be recertified by July 1, 2022. Without that certification, a person cannot be hired or employed as a law enforcement officer in Massachusetts.<br/><br/>The POST Commission&#39;s initial determination not to grant recertification to those seven officers does not necessarily mean that those officers will be off the job Friday. The commission said an officer deemed &quot;not certified&quot; can seek a review within 21 days.<br/><br/>&quot;Until the conclusion of any review or hearing or the expiration of the time for seeking review or hearing, the application for recertification previously submitted will not be deemed &#39;finally determined&#39; by POST. During such time, an officer will be deemed conditionally certified, and thus &#39;certified&#39; as that term is used in&quot; the statute, the POST Commission says in an <a href=""https://www.mass.gov/info-details/post-commission-officer-faqs-recertification-packet-outline-instructions#understanding-your-post-certification-status-"" style=""color: rgb(0, 106, 199); text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-skip-ink: none;"">FAQ page</a> on its website. &quot;If, at the conclusion of that period, the certification is not maintained, the statute will preclude all Massachusetts law enforcement agencies from appointing or employing that person as a law enforcement officer unless the person is certified anew in the future.&quot;<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1656690673461,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1656690673461,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-dd61-ddd0-a5ff-df73c3290003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-6c33-d69c-ade1-fc3bef1a0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-9c9b-d23e-a3b7-bd9bdf450003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-ba74-dd12-a59b-fbffd4b0001e&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-ba74-dd12-a59b-fbffd3e30000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>The 2,181 officers who are under an extension mostly work for the state&#39;s two largest police departments, the State Police (980 officers) and Boston Police (882 officers). There are five agencies — Tolland Police, Swampscott Police, Wellesley College, St. Vincent Hospital and Cambridge Health Alliance — that have not yet submitted the rosters of their officers who are due to be recertified that are required for their extensions.<br/><br/>And one agency — the Franklin County sheriff&#39;s office — had not submitted anything to the POST Commission as of Wednesday, Zuniga said.<br/><br/>&quot;But I believe they will submit something literally today,&quot; he said Thursday morning. &quot;So I&#39;m fairly confident that we will get close to 100 percent compliance.&quot;<br/><br/>Also Thursday morning, the POST Commission voted unanimously to revise <a href=""http://www.statehousenews.com/content/docs/2022/06-30POSTuseofforce.pdf"" style=""color: rgb(0, 106, 199); text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-skip-ink: none;"">use of force regulations</a> to clarify the outright prohibition on chokeholds that the Legislature baked into the 2020 policing reform law. Members of the POST Commission said that representatives brought to their attention the fact that the language of a regulation related to sitting, standing or kneeling on a person&#39;s neck could be interpreted by officers as allowing them to engage in conduct that would constitute a banned chokehold.<br/><br/>&quot;Clearly, what we were trying to do is to make sure that we mirrored or were consistent with the ... statute that bars chokeholds and there is no exception for anything. It just bars chokeholds,&quot; Marsha Kazarosian, a trial attorney appointed to the POST Commission by Attorney General Maura Healey, said. &quot;And this, without this clarification, does cause some confusion. And I know it has been a concern by at least a couple of the representatives, they&#39;ve reached out to us about trying to resolve this.&quot;<br/><br/>The change that the commission unanimously approved Thursday would remove the word &quot;neck&quot; from one section of the regulation and add to the end of that paragraph a new sentence that will say, &quot;In no event may a law enforcement officer intentionally sit, kneel, or stand on an individual&#39;s neck.&quot;<br/><br/>The entire new provision would read: &quot;Except to temporarily gain, regain or maintain control of an individual and apply restraints, a law enforcement officer shall not intentionally sit, kneel, or stand on an individual&#39;s chest or spine, and shall not force an individual to lie on their stomach. In no event may a law enforcement officer intentionally sit, kneel, or stand on an individual&#39;s neck.&quot;<br/><br/>The change cannot take effect unless the Municipal Police Training Committee also approves of it.<br/><br/>Pittsfield Police Chief Michael Wynn, who serves on the POST Commission, said he was part of a briefing with state representatives about the use of force regulations and &quot;I understood their need for clarification.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#39;ve been teaching this stuff for a long time and this is already prohibited conduct, so I don&#39;t have any problems with amending the language,&quot; Wynn said.<br/>",Colin A.

In 2019, Newell and her husband Jared bought the 6,000 square-foot store (plus an extra 5,000 square feet of storage). At the time, most of the produce inventory was packaged or frozen. They added more long shelves of fruits and vegetables, including from local farms.<br/><br/>“We even have things like fiddleheads,” Newell said, pointing at a long shelf of fresh produce. “We get radishes, we get scallions, we get green leaf, red leaf, asparagus, native corn.”<br/><br/>This area of Chicopee has long been <a href=""https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/"" class=""Link"" target=""_blank"" style=""background-repeat: no-repeat; box-sizing: border-box; background-color: transparent; touch-action: manipulation; color: var(--linkColor); text-decoration: none;"">classified by the US government</a> as a low-income, low-access food area, also known as a “food desert,” where it’s hard to find affordable, fresh food.<br/><br/>The Newells say their goal was to fill that void, while making a living, but they are learning how low the profit margin is.<br/><br/>“We actually have yet to cash in any of our paychecks,” Samaita Newell said. “And we have been working here almost three years.”<br/><br/>Newell didn’t start her career in the grocery business. She emigrated as a college student from India, studying physics and astronomy, which is what her family and culture expected from her. But when she started dating Jared, she said, her family stopped supporting her.<br/><br/>“Being an immigrant and studying physics, I didn&#39;t really have like a lot of connections,” she said. “So I had to start somewhere and I started in retail.”<br/><br/>After college, she moved up the ranks of other grocery stores, including Aldi, but feeling stymied as a person of color, she decided it was time to own her own business. Jared had been working for a forestry company. The couple had already bought a few rental properties for income. But they wanted a store.<br/><br/>They bought Fruit Fair for $1.4 million and quickly discovered it would need a lot of investment.<br/><br/>“All of the equipment was falling apart,” Jared Newell said. “More than a quarter of everything was already dated. We had to throw it all out just so that we could have fresh product coming in. The building itself needed and still needs a lot of work. It was just something that we were kind of blindsided with.”<br/><br/>They set about renovating the building so they could turn it into a full-service grocery store. It’s a neighborhood where many people don’t have vehicles to get to more established supermarket chains; the closest is about 2 miles away.<br/><br/>“Driving around, you go to certain places, you find they have a lot of bodegas or a lot of convenience stores, but it&#39;s all chips and soda,” said John Waite, who administers a state-funded program called the <a href=""https://massfoodtrustprogram.org/"" class=""Link"" target=""_blank"" style=""background-repeat: no-repeat; box-sizing: border-box; background-color: transparent; touch-action: manipulation; color: var(--linkColor); text-decoration: none;"">Massachusetts Food Trust</a>.<br/><br/>Waite’s organization, the Franklin County Community Development Corporation, is in charge of giving out loans and grants to food retailers in western and central Massachusetts. The program came out of a <a href=""http://thefoodtrust.org/administrative/massachusetts"" class=""Link"" target=""_blank"" style=""background-repeat: no-repeat; box-sizing: border-box; background-color: transparent; touch-action: manipulation; color: var(--linkColor); text-decoration: none;"">2012 report </a>on the need for more equitable access to healthy food.<br/><br/>Waite said one strategy is to recruit large supermarkets like Big Y and Stop &amp; Shop into underserved areas, but those efforts can take years of advocacy.<br/><br/>“So trying to get a smaller store to increase their offering is the other way to go,” he said. “We also think this is a good economic development tool, increase maybe the size of the store or maybe they can hire another person. And they are buying local.”<br/><br/>The Newells say a loan and grant from the Massachusetts Food Trust has helped keep them afloat. But it still hasn’t been easy.<br/><br/>COVID-19 hit just as they were finishing renovations. More recently, jumping retail prices and the supply chain have put even more strain on the business.<br/><br/>Sales are up by 20%, but some costs have tripled. Every week they have to relabel 200 grocery items to keep up with rising prices.<br/><br/>“The same customers are coming in,” Samaita Newell said, “but instead of getting like 20 things, they&#39;re probably getting like 15 or 16 and thinking like, ‘Okay, this is a huge price difference. This I will get elsewhere.’”<br/><br/>That means stiff competition from large chains such as Walmart, which can sell groceries at a discount.<br/><br/>The Newells are hoping continued investment will bring those customers back. Fruit Fair recently got a separate state infrastructure grant of half a million dollars, which they say will help upgrade equipment and food displays. They will also buy a handicapped-accessible van so they can more easily give rides home to low-income shoppers.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, John Waite said the Massachusetts Food Trust has made 50 loans to grocers since the program began, but it’s been hard to get the word out<br/><br/>“I think the more success stories we have, the more likely that it&#39;ll catch on,” he said.<br/><br/>He said small stores don’t always want to invest in what it takes to provide healthy options, especially during the uncertain times of COVID.<br/><br/>“A lot of these bodegas, they&#39;re making money. So why take on $10,000 debt for a new cooler?” he said. “Hopefully that&#39;s going to start changing. They need to see the customer base is there.”<br/><br/>Samaita and Jared Newell say they’re in it for the long haul — but it is a long haul. Both in their 30s, they have decided to put off having children while they get the store going. This year they hope to finally pay themselves a salary.<br/><br/><i>This story originally appeared on <a href=""https://www.nepm.org/regional-news/2022-06-27/small-grocers-do-their-part-to-eliminate-food-deserts-but-against-considerable-odds"" target=""_blank"">New England Public Media</a>.</i>",Karen Brown,Tue Jul 05 05:00:25 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bolling Municipal Building in Roxbury on Wednesday for a historic meeting as the city&#39;s Black Men and Boys Commission held its first public listening session, and first formal public appearance, in the organization&#39;s history.<br/><br/>Wednesday marked the first time the panel opened itself to the public since its 21 members were appointed by Mayor Michelle Wu in May.<br/><br/>Unlike other government meetings, where officials tend to do a lot of the talking, Wednesday&#39;s meeting was centered around listening to what people had to say. Besides a few comments to keep the discussion on track, the members of the committee stayed mostly quiet as they heard from residents.<br/><br/>&quot;We structured this for the community to have the first voice, the most important voice,&quot; Commission chair Tito Jackson said. &quot;And in the beginning, there was some uncomfortability with that.

Among the many issues brought up, including a need to offer programs and initiatives to prevent violence, preparation for climate change, education and housing, was a consistent theme of the need to support measures to improve mental health and wellness. <br/> <br/>&quot;The basis of much of that was hit on when people spoke about the economic wealth gap and the real need for people to be elevated, not only with jobs but through entrepreneurship,&quot; Jackson said. &quot;And when we look at the massive city budget, the manner in which those contracts are partitioned and whether or not people of color, and in particular Black men, have an opportunity to be at the table for those contracts. Which then means they&#39;re going to hire folks from these communities, right?&quot;<br/> <br/>Frank Farrow, executive director of the Office of Black Male Advancement, echoed Jackson in saying that the meeting revealed that the community knows the problems it faces, and also knows the solutions.<br/> <br/>&quot;And it just reaffirms the need to listen to community first and bring them along the process, that they&#39;re driving what the work is going to look like,&quot; he said. &quot;Because it&#39;s a heavy load and we&#39;re going to need everybody at the table.&quot;<br/> <br/>The commission represents a nearly ten-year, multi-administration effort to train a municipal lens on Black men and boys in the City of Boston.<br/> <br/>The panel was proposed and unanimously passed by the city council, but was vetoed in 2014 by then-Mayor Marty Walsh. It was ultimately authorized last September by acting Mayor Kim Janey.<br/> <br/>Then in February, Mayor Michelle Wu announced the commission’s open application period along with the formation of the new Office of Black Male Advancement. <br/> <br/>It is unclear how many times the panel met prior to Wednesday’s community session, though several members acknowledged previously convening in introductory sessions. The meetings were not publicly noticed by the city, according to a GBH News review of Boston’s digitally archived public notices.<br/> <br/>Wu administration officials familiar with the panel’s work said at least one prior meeting last month was intended as an introductory conversation to help members become familiar with one another. Jackson pointed out that the budget cycle for the Office of Black Male Advancement, which directs and supports the commission, started on July 1.<br/> <br/>Another community listening session is scheduled for Wednesday, Aug. 3. For Jackson, the work is as important now as it was when he started to push for such a commission years ago.<br/> <br/>&quot;And as Governor [Deval] Patrick used to say, this is about turning to each other and not on each other in difficult times,&quot; he said. &quot;And this warms my heart &#39;cause this has been a passion of mine.&quot;","Saraya Wintersmith, Esteban Bustillos",Thu Jul 07 11:54:17 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Taxpayers Foundation estimates 'historic' budget surplus of $3.6 billion,"The Department of Revenue is still counting, but the budget watchers at the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation expect that the Legislature will have a surplus of $3.6 billion when the final accounting of the fiscal year that ended last week is complete.<br/><br/>Through May, the state had collected $36.969 billion in tax revenue for fiscal year 2022 — $2.666 billion or 7.8 percent ahead of expectations. Combined with two upgrades the executive branch made during the budget year, MTF said Massachusetts is $5.932 billion ahead of benchmark.<br/><br/>But that&#39;s not the anticipated surplus. Supplemental spending has wiped out about $1.6 billion of the overage, about $1.2 billion in above-benchmark capital gains will be statutorily bound for reserves and more than $250 million is due to the School Building Authority and MBTA. When all is said and done, including accounting for an addition $750 million in federal revenue, MTF said it anticipates the final FY2022 surplus will be roughly $3.588 billion, which it notes would be more than twice as large as the roughly $1.5 billion surplus of fiscal year 2021.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1657207780713,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1657207780713,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-d4e8-d0e3-afe1-f6ee337d0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-cede-d0e3-afe1-fefe922a0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-b668-d23e-a3b7-bf7b1f790003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-d947-dd12-a59b-fbffa2160019&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-d947-dd12-a59b-fbffa1420000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>&quot;The primary reason the surplus is larger this year is because the original FY 2021 budget relied on close to $2 billion in one-time resources, including the Stabilization Fund.

The original FY 2022 budget did not rely on the Stabilization Fund or other one-time resources, freeing up excess tax revenues for the surplus,&quot; MTF wrote in <a href=""https://masstaxpayers.org/sites/default/files/publications/2022-07/MTF%20FY%202022%20Surplus%20Brief%20FINAL.pdf"" target=""_blank"">its brief</a>.<br/><br/>The organization pointed out four things that could change its calculations: if June revenues come in above the $3.363 billion benchmark, the surplus will increase; a greater amount of above-benchmark capital gains would divert more to the state&#39;s rainy day fund; an updated view of outstanding account deficiencies could eat away at some of the surplus; and significant reversions, or appropriated funds that go unspent, could increase the surplus.<br/><br/>&quot;The FY 2022 budget surplus will be historic and it will require careful planning to use it effectively and sustainably,&quot; MTF said.<br/><br/>In addition to any FY2022 surplus, the Legislature also has $2.3 billion in unspent American Rescue Plan Act money at its disposal and is expecting that the state will collect at least $36.915 billion in tax revenue in fiscal year 2023, which began July 1.

Article,"'An intelligence failure of significant proportions' preceded white supremacists' march in Boston, city leaders say","'An intelligence failure of significant proportions' preceded white supremacists' march in Boston, city leaders say","<i>Updated at 8:30 a.m. July 9</i><br/><br/>Members of Boston’s City Council and some terrorism experts are declaring last weekend’s white nationalist march through Boston an “intelligence failure” because local leaders had no idea the hate group with a history of violence was coming to town.<br/><br/>Councilman Ricardo Arroyo has called for a public hearing questioning why the Boston Regional Intelligence Center seemed to have no knowledge of the cross-country organizing by the Patriot Front to assemble its members in Boston July 2. Patriot Front is a white supremacist group formed in the aftermath of the violent 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, during which a supporter drove his car into a crowd of demonstrators, killing one person.<br/><br/>Arroyo, who is running for Suffolk County district attorney this year, said “white nationalist hate groups are domestic terrorists. And so when we are talking about a group like that coming to Boston with no alleged intelligence of their arrival — even though it required them traveling across state lines, even though it required them coordinating in a way that clearly involved communications and diligence — is striking to me.”<br/><br/>Acting DA Kevin Hayden, Arroyo’s opponent, in a statement said his office is working closely with the Boston Police Department’s Civil Rights Unit on the investigation of the white supremacist march. <br/><br/>“The presence of such organized hatred in Boston on Independence Day weekend was repugnant,” Hayden said. “[Investigators] are poring over surveillance video to help identify Patriot Front marchers and pursue possible criminal charges. If and when arrests are made we will prosecute to the fullest extent allowed by Massachusetts law.”<br/> <br/>Hayden’s office did not address the allegations of poor intelligence.<br/> <br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1657311952661,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1657311952661,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-d23d-dd35-afcd-ffbff75e0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-caab-d0e3-afe1-faef039a0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-d3cc-dd12-a59b-fbff1f8c0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-df7c-d1b6-abf1-ff7efdbe000e&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-df7c-d1b6-abf1-ff7efce40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>Thomas Nolan, a former Boston Police lieutenant and Homeland Security official, shared Arroyo’s amazement that there was no intelligence warning in advance of the July 2 demonstration. Nolan was responsible for training analysts and police assigned to “fusion centers” nationwide, including the BRIC, which were established in the aftermath of 9/11 to promote information sharing between federal and state, local and tribal law enforcement. <br/><br/>The BRIC did not live up to its responsibilities in pre-empting the Patriot Front gathering, Nolan said. “I think it&#39;s fair to characterize it as an intelligence failure of significant proportions.”<br/><br/>“The Patriot Front has been involved in vandalism, arson, theft, destruction of property, including an arrest of 30-something of them in Idaho some several weeks ago,” Nolan told GBH News. “This group can reasonably be suspected of involvement in criminal activity.”<br/><br/>Nolan said fusion centers were created specifically “to collect information, analyze the information, prepare what are called intelligence products in order to disseminate those to law enforcement officials who are in the field so that they can take informed and appropriate action. And that didn&#39;t happen here.”<br/><br/>As documented by the GBH News Center for Investigative Reporting, over the past two years, <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2022/05/18/it-is-happening-here-massachusetts-has-a-growing-neo-nazi-movement"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>Patriot Front and other white supremacist groups have been advertising their presence in New England</u></a> with leaflet distributions over a wide area, banner drops over freeway overpasses, and recruitment efforts on college campuses, as well as a stepped up online presence on the social media sites Telegram and Discord.<br/><br/>Salem’s new police chief, Lucis Miller, told GBH News that in his initial briefings with the FBI he was told that the Patriot Front and other groups like the explicitly neo-Nazi NSC-131 were priority concerns to law enforcement. Two Patriot Front members were charged with defacing public property for spray painting slogans around Salem last summer.<br/><br/>That makes BRIC’s “failure” to closely monitor these groups and Patriot Front’s descent on Boston all the more surprising, said Arroyo. <br/><br/>A researcher who closely tracks white nationalist groups on social media channels — who asked not to be named out of concern for their personal safety — said it was surprising that those channels provided no advance signal of the Boston rally, which appears to have been “well organized and conceived.” <br/><br/>When the group arrived in the Boston area last week, they parked their cars near the Oak Grove Orange Line station in Malden. <br/><br/>A video recorded by Rod Webber, a local anti-fascist filmmaker, showed those vehicles bore license plates from Texas, Ohio and Pennsylvania, among other states. <br/><br/>Uniformed, white-masked members of the group took the subway to another location where they were given heavy shields unloaded from the back of a rented U-Haul van. <br/><br/>They paraded through downtown Boston and Copley Square, where they assembled in front of the main public library. Charles Murrell III, a local artist who is Black, says he was on Dartmouth Street when he saw the procession of white supremacists. Murrell said he was then assaulted by several of the group’s members. <br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1657311691091,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1657311691091,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-df78-d804-a7ed-ff7a8dc50001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-df78-d8b0-a9c5-ff7884c20000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-df78-d8b0-a9c5-ff7884a50000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">Boston March</bsp-image><br/><br/>Boston Police Superintendent-in-Chief Gregory Long at a press conference Tuesday said police officers did not witness the alleged attack. <br/><br/>But Jim Cyr, an architect and resident of the South End, said he saw the assault on Murrell. Cyr told GBH News he was shocked over the lack of a police presence, but also by the response he said he received from Boston Police when he reported the attack on Murrell. <br/><br/>“I called 911, and when I got the operator, she asked me where I was and I said, ‘I&#39;m on the corner of Dartmouth and I think it&#39;s Saint James.’ And she hung up.” Cyr said. Eventually “at least two police cars came up and I tried to talk to a couple of the officers, and they didn&#39;t even acknowledge my existence.”<br/><br/>Videos of the march show very little or no police presence, but two members of the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force are visible, dressed in plain clothes. The FBI has not responded to a request for an explanation of their presence.<br/><br/>At Tuesday’s press conference FBI Special Agent in Charge Joseph Bonavolonta, a part of the JTTF, <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2022/07/05/wu-rollins-say-they-had-no-warning-of-white-supremacist-groups-plans-to-march-in-boston"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>said the FBI cannot legally track domestic groups such as the Patriot Front</u></a> unless there is “the existence of a potential federal crime, the threat or use of force or violence in conjunction with some sort of a social or political agenda.”<br/><br/>Authorities are working to identify the masked white supremacists involved by piecing together videos of the incident, but at least one well-known member of the group Brian Harwood, 25, formerly of Barnstable, paraded unmasked.<br/><br/>Boston City Council has previously debated the value of the regional intelligence center and last year initially rejected an $850,000 state grant for the BRIC. The BPD said in a statement at the time that the grant would have been used to “hire six analysts that would enhance our ability to increase and provide public safety to the people of Boston.”<br/><br/>Councilors cited BRIC’s “racially discriminatory” uses of a gang database for their decision. The funding for BRIC was ultimately awarded. <br/><br/>Councilor Julia Mejia was among those who at first opposed funding for the agency unless it addressed issues of “unfair treatment” on the streets. She supports Arroyo’s call for a hearing on BRIC. <br/><br/>“I believe that during this hearing, we&#39;ll be able to uncover what happened and what are the levers of accountability,” she said. “We&#39;ve heard from folks out here, if, let&#39;s say for instance this was a Black Lives Matter rally, that the intel would have surfaced up to the top a lot sooner. So I believe this public hearing is an opportunity to really lean in to what went wrong and how it was that these white nationalist group was able to sneak in here without notice.”<br/><br/>U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins in recent interviews with GBH News has called on the city to classify white supremacist groups like the Patriot Front and NSC-131 as gangs on par with MS-13, the Columbia Dawgs and other violent groups. <br/><br/>Arroyo said he will make a formal request for a hearing into BRIC’s “intelligence failure” at a regularly scheduled Boston City Council meeting next Wednesday. <br/><br/><i>Correction: This story was updated to correct the spelling of Rod Webber&#39;s name.</i>",Phillip Martin,Fri Jul 08 16:28:39 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,Seen any baby turkeys recently? MassWildlife wants to know about them,Seen any baby turkeys recently? MassWildlife wants to know about them,"Wild turkeys are native to Massachusetts; Benjamin Franklin famously proposed the plump ground birds over the bald eagle as a national symbol for the fledgling nation. But in 1851 the last known native bird was killed, and in the 1970s biologists at MassWildlife began efforts to repopulate the bird in the state.<br/><br/>But they didn’t start comprehensively measuring the fruits of their labors until the 1990s when they launched the Wild Turkey Brood Count.<br/><br/>Today they are everywhere, with an approximated 35,000 turkeys from the forests of Eastern Massachusetts to the narrow streets of Somerville and Boston. <br/><br/>Around this time of year, turkeys breed and hatch new poults. From June 1 to Aug. 31, the Massachusetts Division of Fishery and Wildlife wants residents&#39; help counting as many wild turkeys as possible. <br/><br/>Data from the annual Turkey Brood Survey allows scientists to estimate productivity, reproductive success and fall harvest potential among Massachusetts’ wild turkey population.<br/><br/>David Scarpitti, turkey and upland game project leader at MassWildlife, told GBH News that the survey has gained popularity among the general population in Massachusetts.<br/><br/>“It’s a really popular survey, the response rate is really quite high, it provides a really useful source of data for us,” Scarpitti said.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1657316479277,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1657316479277,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-b8db-d39c-a5f8-fcdb48490003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-5389-d269-a3fd-ffbb54bc0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-0675-de43-ad7f-aff7ca8f0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-dfc1-d1b6-abf1-ffdf088d0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-dfc1-d1b6-abf1-ffdf07b30000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>Mass Audubon&#39;s Director of Important Bird Areas Wayne Petersen told GBH News of the importance of ways that the information could be used by MassWildlife officials. <br/><br/>“The turkeys may have a very productive nesting season and then be lots of broods, and then in other years for whatever the reasons they may be less successful. So that&#39;s how over time they begin to track what the population is doing,” Petersen said.<br/><br/>The Turkey Brood Survey is not only used to count how many turkeys Massachusetts has. According to Scarpitti, scientists like him and others at MassWildlife also track the lifespan of poults from the beginning to the end of the summer.<br/><br/>“So you have these very small turkeys on the landscape; they&#39;re really quite vulnerable to predation and to all sorts of other factors that cause mortality,” Scarpitti said, “What we see is that by the end of the summer when they&#39;re about 3 months old those birds are pretty grown, they&#39;re pretty capable, so if they survive that three-month period, that gauntlet of those three months, they&#39;re probably going to survive well after.”<br/><br/>Turkeys are habitual and social birds, for the scientists at MassWildlife, it is almost impossible to avoid double counting some wild turkeys.<br/><br/>“When you fill out the form there is a section that just says, ‘do you believe that you&#39;ve seen this group of turkeys before?’” Scarpitti said.<br/><br/><a href=""https://www.mass.gov/service-details/wild-turkey-brood-survey"" target=""_blank"">The Turkey Brood Survey can be found on the MassWildlife website</a>.<br/><br/><b>Have you spotted turkeys in your neighborhood?

The killing on July 7, 2021, ousted Moïse after four and a half years in power. There is still an ongoing manhunt for some of the gunmen and the mastermind behind the attack.<br/><br/>Haitian immigrants in Boston say they have felt uneasy watching their home country struggle after the assassination. Dr. Geralde Gabeau, the founder and executive director of the Immigrant Family Services Institute, a local nonprofit organization, told GBH News that there is outrage among Haitian people.<br/><br/>“After a full year [since] an assassination there is no real clear path for justice — not just for the president but for the country as a whole,” Gabeau said.<br/><br/>The country’s politics continue to be in a state of disarray, with the office of the president still vacant and with Prime Minister Ariel Henry serving as both acting president and prime minister.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1657570463348,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1657570463348,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-88f9-d70c-a57f-baf9ad670001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017b-7e0a-d950-abfb-fe0e39540003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-bb95-dd7d-a57b-bf9d7f0e0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-eee4-d1b6-abf1-effe977e0009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-eee4-d1b6-abf1-effe96930000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>For Gabeau, this political instability has added fuel to an already burning fire, with widespread violence and crime in the country.<br/><br/>“When you cannot trust those who are in power, everyone is left on their own,” Gabeau said. “We have cases where people are attacked in the street, they are being kidnapped and when they call the police, they say, ‘We cannot do anything, because we don&#39;t have the resources.’”<br/><br/>Some local advocates, like the Rev. Dieufort Fleurissaint, have watched from afar as the country experiences turmoil. Fleurissaint has not gone back to Haiti in more than three years. He still has ties to Haiti and keeps in constant contact with friends and family.<br/><br/>“Haiti has been infested by many gang activities and many kidnappings continue to take place in the country,” Fleurissaint said about the conditions on the ground. “The country has been plagued by many evil situations.”<br/><br/>The effects of the killing were felt not just in Haiti, but also in parts of the United States that have experienced a large influx of Haitian immigrants, including Boston. <br/><br/>“We have so many issues like kidnapping, gang violence and a lot of people are leaving Haiti like crazy to find a place to come,&quot; Gabeau said.<br/><br/>Gabeau, whose organization helps new immigrant families arriving in Boston, said that a lack of jobs is causing many Haitians to leave their country. <br/><br/>“We have so many young professionals, people who are medical doctors, engineers, just to name a few who have to leave their job behind, all of their opportunities they have, they have to leave behind to come here. Because they cannot function, they cannot work,” Gabeau said.<br/><br/>Looking toward the future, Fleurissaint hopes to return to his homeland. Even though about three years have passed, his intentions to go back remain strong.<br/><br/>“I dream of going back to Haiti, even though I have not been able to travel to Haiti. But I have been able to maintain a close tie to the country,” Fleurissaint said. ”I have many pastors at home, we pray throughout the week, three to four times a week with them via Zoom, for God to change the conditions in Haiti.”",Fernando Cervantes Jr.,Mon Jul 11 16:15:18 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,"On abortion, House and Senate agreements and disagreements come into view","On abortion, House and Senate agreements and disagreements come into view","House and Senate Democrats are in agreement on a suite of reforms to protect access to abortions and shield Bay State providers amid tightening restrictions elsewhere, and they may need to set aside any differences to stave off a potential veto.<br/><br/>The Senate teed up a bill on Monday (<a href=""https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/S2996"" target=""_blank"">S 2996</a>) that would implement a range of legal and licensing protections for Massachusetts professionals who offer reproductive and gender-affirming care, prohibit insurers from sharing abortion costs with patients, and make emergency contraceptives more widely available.<br/><br/>In the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court decision that eliminated the national right to an abortion, senators will vote Wednesday on a new version of standalone legislation that cleared the House with a 136-17 vote less than a week after justices handed down their ruling.<br/><br/>Some provisions in the bill moving through the Legislature, including a ban on the administration cooperating with out-of-state extradition attempts over abortion and other services legal in Massachusetts, already feature in an executive order Republican Gov. Charlie Baker <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2022/06/24/baker-signs-executive-order-to-shield-mass-abortion-providers-from-lawsuits"">issued just hours after the court&#39;s decision</a>.<br/><br/>But Sen. Cindy Friedman, an Arlington Democrat who filed the Senate redraft, said the legislation is &quot;much, much bigger&quot; than Baker&#39;s order and would keep protections in place permanently.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#39;s much more inclusive than the governor, who has certain things he can control and certain things he can&#39;t,&quot; Friedman said in an interview. &quot;This is why this is so important.&quot;<br/><br/>The bill set for Senate debate on Wednesday would shield against out-of-state legal action seeking to punish abortions and other health care services legal within Massachusetts, offering those protections both to Bay State providers and patients who travel here.<br/><br/>It would also order the Department of Public Health to issue a standing order allowing any licensed pharmacist to dispense emergency contraceptives, mandate that health insurance plans cover abortions without copays, deductibles or coinsurance, and allow providers to make their home addresses private.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1657575220405,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1657575220405,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-a60a-d0e3-afe1-f66e75e20003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-b1d8-d4bf-abc3-bffeda2c0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-970d-d23e-a3b7-bf1fd0d30003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-ef2d-d7e6-abed-effd68170010&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-ef2d-d7e6-abed-effd67260000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>However, the version Friedman filed does not include two other sections that featured in the bill the House approved late last month: it would not make emergency contraceptives such as Plan B available in vending machines, and it would not expand when abortions are allowed after 24 weeks of pregnancy.<br/><br/>Friedman said senators &quot;didn&#39;t really have time&quot; to consider the impacts of allowing vending machines to dispense emergency contraceptives as they work to get a bill to Baker before the July 31 end of formal business for the term.<br/><br/>She cited a similar concern with language the House approved that would authorize abortions after 24 weeks in cases of &quot;severe&quot; fetal anomalies.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#39;ve heard from my colleagues and I&#39;ve heard from outside the building that people are concerned when you put in a word like &#39;severe&#39; with no real clear definition, what are you talking about?&quot; Friedman said. &quot;Does it open a door wider than people are comfortable with? I respect that, and I think we need to — again, this is a very, very short timeframe, and right now, what I see as the absolute critical piece of this is to make sure our providers are protected and women who come here for an abortion are protected.&quot;<br/><br/>Existing state law limits abortions after 24 weeks only to situations in which a physician has determined there is a &quot;lethal fetal anomaly,&quot; that the fetus is &quot;incompatible with sustained life outside the uterus,&quot; or that an abortion is necessary &quot;to preserve the patient&#39;s physical or mental health.&quot;<br/><br/>Lawmakers enacted some of that language over Baker&#39;s veto in a 2020 law known as the ROE Act. At the time, Baker said he supported parts of the bill making abortions available if the fetus would not survive after birth <a href=""https://statehousenews.com/news/20202678"" target=""_blank"">but opposed other sections</a> &quot;that expand the availability of later term abortions.&quot;<br/><br/>Friedman said that precedent makes her believe Baker would veto the current bill moving through the Legislature if it landed on his desk with language allowing abortions after 24 weeks in cases with &quot;severe&quot; fetal anomalies.<br/><br/>&quot;The governor was very clear, made this very well known, that &#39;severe&#39; — that language would cause him to veto,&quot; Friedman said.<br/><br/>Friedman stressed that she wants lawmakers to circle back to that topic, saying she is concerned that some providers do not always make abortions available in cases when a fetus is incompatible with life outside the womb. But the narrow timeframe for getting a new law on the books has narrowed her scope.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#39;s not that the other pieces are not incredibly important,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#39;s just if I have a short amount of time, I will argue for the protection (language) first and foremost.&quot;<br/><br/>Following the Senate passage expected this week, legislative leaders could name a conference committee to hash out a final version of the bill. That group will face pressure to work quickly and close the gaps between the branches before the end of the month.<br/><br/>&quot;It is clear to me that both the House and the Senate care very, very deeply about this issue. Both have the same goal of protecting women. I think that&#39;s clear,&quot; Friedman said. &quot;I would think that when you come to a conversation where you&#39;re both coming from the same place, you will be able to get through the differences.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re never going to do them,&quot; she added. &quot;It doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re against any of this. I don&#39;t believe the Senate is against any of this. It&#39;s just the timing of it that is tough because we&#39;re so late in the formal sessions and we have an administration that&#39;s been pretty clear about where they come down.&quot;<br/><br/>The Senate had already adopted a similar but smaller-scale measure creating legal shields and emergency contraceptive access <a href=""https://statehousenews.com/news/2022904"" target=""_blank"">as part of its fiscal year 2023 budget bill</a>, when the court appeared poised to overturn Roe v. Wade but had not yet officially done so.<br/><br/>Lawmakers continue to negotiate a final budget 11 days into FY23, and it appears the eventual spending bill compromise will not include the Senate&#39;s reproductive and gender-affirming care language.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#39;re probably going to pursue it in a standalone bill now,&quot; Senate Ways and Means Committee Chair Michael Rodrigues, who serves as his chamber&#39;s budget chief, said Monday. &quot;That&#39;d be the path of least resistance to get it to the governor&#39;s desk.&quot;<br/><br/><i>Sam Doran contributed reporting.</i>",Chris Lisinski | State House News ,Mon Jul 11 17:50:50 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three women who were interviewed said they experienced physical violence from staff. <br/><br/>Transgender women incarcerated in men’s facilities reported facing sexual misconduct from both correctional staff and incarcerated men. According to the report, transgender women also reported a lack of access to gender-affirming health care. <br/><br/>Sarah Nawab, the primary author of the report, said one problem investigators had is that women were fearful of coming forward because of concerns over retaliation. <br/><br/>“The way that things are supposed to work, [the Department of Correction] is supposed to be responsible for incarcerated women’s safety,” she said. “But the reality is there’s no kind of prison that will ever be safe for women and women were in fear of retaliation when they would report to us, which is why they did not want to pursue any sort of recourse through traditional means and the traditional justice system.”<br/><br/>A DOC spokesperson said the department does not tolerate “any form of sexual abuse or harassment by those living or working within its facilities.”<br/><br/>“DOC’s comprehensive internal procedures exist to prevent, detect, and respond to any such conduct, and hold any staff found to be in violation of DOC’s standards accountable,” the spokesperson told GBH News via email. “The highest standards of health, safety, and wellbeing of those entrusted to our care remains central to our rehabilitative mission.”<br/><br/>Prisoners’ Legal Services is calling on the state to take a number of measures to combat these issues, including implementing oversight from an independent body to bring more accountability and transparency to the DOC. <br/><br/>“And then beyond that, in terms of what the state can do, I think the state can focus on releasing as many women as possible from prison because, again, I would argue that there is no form of prison that is rehabilitative. Rehabilitation, healing, that happens in the community,” Nawab said. <br/><br/>Elizabeth Matos, executive director of Prisoners&#39; Legal Services, noted the timing of publication for the report, which is coming out amid debate over a <a href=""https://commonwealthmagazine.org/criminal-justice/report-backs-smaller-womens-prison-to-replace-mci-framingham/"" target=""_blank"">proposed</a> $40 million rehabililation center<b> </b>for women<b> </b>run by the DOC that would aim to address some of the issues women face in Massachusetts prisons. <br/><br/>Matos said that<b> </b>proposal<b> </b>glosses over the elephant in the room. <br/><br/>“This is a culturally entrenched system that perpetrates a lot of harm on people and has for a long time,” she said. <br/><br/>Prisoners’ Legal Services is also in support of <a href=""https://www.masslive.com/politics/2022/06/state-senate-passes-bill-banning-prison-jail-construction-in-massachusetts-for-5-years.html"" target=""_blank"">legislation</a> that would put a five-year moratorium on new jails and prisons being built within the commonwealth. It’s a bill that is crucial in Matos’ mind. <br/><br/>“And it’s not at all a radical bill,” she said. “You know, there are much more radical bills that could be out there. This is just saying, ‘Let’s pause for five years and figure out what the most effective thing is to do right now to actually address the kinds of things and needs that women have and how to prevent harm from happening.’<br/><br/>“This isn’t the way to do it. We know that,” she continued. “We see that every day in our work and I think the report really goes a long way just showing why a pause is necessary. Throwing $40 million at a system that is not taking care of women makes very little sense and is really fiscally irresponsible, if nothing else.”",Esteban Bustillos,Tue Jul 12 17:45:40 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,‘There’s a lot of joy here’: How one Greater Boston studio helps artists with disabilities thrive,‘There’s a lot of joy here’: How one Greater Boston studio helps artists with disabilities thrive,"Carl Phillips finds inspiration for his art in many places — especially comic books and superheroes. <br/><br/>“I like Iron Man, Superman, Spider-Man, Batman, Doctor Strange, Thor, Captain America, Aquaman,” he said. <br/><br/>On a recent summer morning at his workspace at Gateway Arts in Brookline, Phillips was hunched over a tracing of Iron Man and Shazam that he had outlined in black and was getting ready to color in with red and yellow markers. <br/><br/>Phillips is one the artists who works at Gateway Arts, a nonprofit studio that supports adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities to have a career in the arts. Gateway provides them with professional studio space where they can work, a gallery to show their art, and a retail shop where they can sell their pieces. Artists come from all over the Boston area to work at the studio. Now approaching its 50th anniversary, Gateway is one of the oldest of its kind in the country. <br/><br/>There are currently about 90 artists who work at Gateway, a number that dipped during the COVID-19 pandemic. Gateway had to close for three months at the height of the pandemic, pause some of its programs, including pottery and jewelry-making, and enact social distancing policies in its studios. But it’s slowly returning to its pre-pandemic activities. It hosted its first in-person exhibition show in March of this year.<br/><br/>GBH News recently visited Gateway Arts, and found that the studios were buzzing with activity, as people painted, drew, sculpted and crafted. Phillips was dancing to The Beatles next to his workspace.<br/><br/>Phillips, a Cambridge resident, has been coming to Gateway for 20 years. In addition to drawing he has learned embroidery, weaving and pottery. He says that art makes him happy. <br/><br/>“Art is beautiful. It&#39;s nice. It&#39;s good,” he said. <br/><br/>Inspiration comes from everywhere for Phillips. Some of his favorite <a href=""https://www.gatewayarts.org/art/artists/carl-h-phillips/"" target=""_blank"">embroideries he’s created</a> include a pie chart he saw on a TV commercial, a horseshoe and a bright orange traffic cone.

Phillips holds his embroidered die</bsp-image><br/><br/>“It&#39;s very good. I love to come here and work,” Phillips said about Gateway. <br/><br/>Gateway’s focus is on art as a career, not necessarily art as therapy — all Gateway artists can sell their work in the Brookline Village shop, where they earn 50% from the sales. The other 50% goes back into Gateway to support its programs.<br/><br/>Artists are not required to have previous art experience, but they are expected to have a serious interest in a career in art. Most artists get financial support to come to Gateway through state agencies like the Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services, and the arrangements usually expect an artist to produce a certain number of works per year. There is no limit on how long an artist can stay at Gateway — in fact, there are a few current artists who have been there since its founding. <br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1657741612817,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000168-2a01-dff6-a1ef-fabd12060000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1657741612817,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000168-2a01-dff6-a1ef-fabd12060000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-fb50-d0cd-a1ff-ff78dc620003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-d32a-dd35-afcd-ffbb4aec0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017f-4733-d6af-a77f-5f372d5c0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-f918-d7e6-abed-f9d857e50000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-f918-d7e6-abed-f9d857b30000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>“They [the artists] are held to a high standard. And as a result, it&#39;s a really productive but collegial and joyful environment,” said Gateway Director Greg Liakos. He says fostering a career in art can often unleash a new world of opportunities for the people who come to Gateway.<br/><br/>“An artist who may have difficulty articulating their feelings or their experiences verbally can come here and express in complex and profound ways their life experiences with a paintbrush or a pencil or a pottery or jewelry,” Liakos said. “And the level of artistic achievement here every day is truly remarkable.”<br/><br/>Gateway started in 1973, when state institutions for people with mental health challenges and developmental disabilities were shuttered. Gateway was formed in response to that de-institutionalization, to help adults transition from those state facilities into their communities.<br/><br/>“Gateway, in the beginning, yes, did art, but it also taught people how to function in group homes, take care of themselves, cooking, cleaning,” said Bil Thibodeau, Gateway’s artistic director. <br/><br/>But while art was not always the focus, Thibodeau said it has always been a key element of Gateway.<br/><br/>“It&#39;s beautiful how proud the artists are of their work,” he said.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1657741515527,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000168-2a01-dff6-a1ef-fabd12060000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1657741515527,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000168-2a01-dff6-a1ef-fabd12060000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;quote&quot;:&quot;“Art is beautiful.

Her mom was an art teacher, but Doucette didn’t consider herself an artist before coming to Gateway nine years ago. She quickly picked up weaving, and then making scarves and then embroidery. “It was soothing and you just kind of felt comfortable in that work,” she said about discovering her love of art.<br/><br/>A team of facilitators who are working artists help the artists at Gateway hone their craft in weaving, painting, drawing, embroidery and found art. Doucette says her favorite part of coming to Gateway is the staff. She says they have encouraged her to “get out of my comfort zone on colors a little bit.”<br/><br/>That progress is visible on a work of hers that’s currently hanging in the studio’s gallery: an embroidery on canvas featuring a sunset-colored wine glass against a vibrant blue background. She chose the colors “because of the beach, most of the beach colors are kind of tropical or light tropical,” she said.<br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1658172452528,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-9b02-dab0-a57d-ff17ee120000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1658172452528,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-9b02-dab0-a57d-ff17ee120000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000182-12c6-d6aa-a7a3-5fd69dbf0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-12c6-dab7-a3bf-7edf913a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-12c6-dab7-a3bf-7edf91140000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">Alison Doucette with embroidery of Robert Pattinson</bsp-image><br/>Like Phillips, Doucette is also inspired by pop culture. <u><a href=""https://www.gatewayarts.org/art/artists/alison-doucette/"" target=""_blank"">She has made embroideries</a></u> of George and Amal Clooney, Prince Harry’s wedding, &quot;Judge Judy&quot; and one of “Twilight” star Robert Pattinson.<br/><br/>It can take two months or more for Doucette to complete a work.

Doucette said she is excited to start promoting and selling her work outside of Gateway.<br/><br/>Works at Gateway’s shop sell for a range, with greeting cards costing $5 and tote bags at around $20, to large canvas paintings that sell for up to $800.

Article,Massachusetts bans natural hair discrimination,Massachusetts bans natural hair discrimination,"<i>Updated July 26 at 5:47 p.m.</i><br/><br/>It is now illegal in Massachusetts to discriminate against someone based on their hair texture or style.<br/><br/>Gov. Charlie Baker on Tuesday signed into law a bill that protects people with natural hairstyles — including braids, locks, twists and other protective styles — against discrimination in public schools, workplaces and public spaces.<br/><br/>This law is slightly different from bills the state House and Senate passed in the spring. The Senate wanted to extend discrimination protections to religious schools and private school athletes, but the final bill the two chambers agreed upon does not apply to those institutions.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1658248992605,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1658248992605,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017f-bcea-de45-afff-bfff74350003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017f-ae5f-de45-afff-afffffc20003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-3781-d887-adfb-779b4c430000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-1756-dab7-a3bf-7fdf98e50017&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-1756-dab7-a3bf-7fdf98080000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>The original Senate bill was introduced back in March by Assistant Majority Leader Sen. Sal N. DiDomenico.<br/><br/>“We were inspired by these two sisters at Mystic Valley Charter School who had to go through that unfortunate situation and be discriminated against by their own school,” he said.<br/><br/>In April 2017, sisters Mya and Deanna Cook, two Black 15-year-old students at Mystic Valley Regional Charter School, were ordered by school administrators to remove their braid extensions as these violated the school’s hair and makeup policy. Following this, the school imposed detention and threatened to suspend the sisters from the institution. An outpouring of support and legal action followed.<br/><br/>“[These policies are] a proxy for race,” said state Sen. Lydia Edwards. “This is just an extension of the many ways in which racism and discrimination has extended itself.”<br/><br/>For Edwards, who is currently Massachusetts&#39; only Black senator, this issue is not only one for equality but also a personal one.<br/><br/>“I’ve been through the ups and downs in the journey with my own hair,” she said. “I was putting in so much money making my hair what it wasn’t, because I thought it was what was professional.”<br/><br/>On the other hand, Sen. DiDomenico expressed his happiness to pass the anti-discrimination bill, but also expressed his incredulity for the need to pass one.<br/><br/>“It seems crazy that we even have to pass a bill to address this issue. To make sure that young people and people in the workplace are not discriminated against based on their natural hairstyle,” DiDomenico said.<br/><br/>DiDomenico said he was happy for the Cook sisters.<br/><br/>“They inspired this bill and they were part of the process of getting it filed,” DiDomenico said, adding that he was glad they could see &quot;all they had to go through wasn&#39;t in vain.”<br/><br/><i>This story was updated after Gov.

Article,Summer camps can't find staff. That means less child care for Maine parents,Summer camps can't find staff. That means less child care for Maine parents,"The sun is barely above the treeline as Chris Shea welcomes about 80 kids to a <a href=""https://alymca.org/programs/summer-camp/"" target=""_blank"">summer camp</a> organized by the YMCA of Auburn-Lewiston on a recent weekday morning, his voice bellowing through the trees.<br/><br/>Each day, the campers scatter across 93 acres of woods and fields, with enough space for all of the classic summer camp activities, from archery to swimming.<br/><br/>Shea says it&#39;s a valuable experience for a lot of kids — a way to get them outdoors and socializing with new friends, something especially important after years of remote and hybrid schooling.<br/><br/>But even as he looks out at dozens of smiling faces, Shea says this summer&#39;s camp can sometimes feel empty.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#39;s almost like, half the numbers you want to see in front of you, as you give announcements. So it&#39;s a little discouraging and disappointing,&quot; he says. &quot;But I guess it is what it is, and you do the best you can with what you&#39;ve got.&quot;<br/><br/>The YMCA of Auburn-Lewiston anticipated around 120 kids this summer. But Shea says the organization wound up limiting capacity to about 80 campers.<br/><br/>That&#39;s because summer camps across the state are dealing with a shortage of counselors, as a tight labor market leads many young people to other jobs, reducing the scant quantity of child care for parents across the state.<br/><br/>&quot;Child care, and camp, it&#39;s not an easy job, right?

But this year, fewer are signing up, burnt out from years of hybrid and remote learning.<br/><br/>Add it up, and the shortage of workers has forced several day camps — from YMCAs to nonprofits and local recreation departments — to cut back on capacity or cancel programs altogether, in some cases leading to long waitlists.

You sent your child for a couple of weeks, or a specialty camp here or there,&quot; she says. &quot;Most of the families in our YMCA camp programs are sending their children for the whole summer. Because it is their child care.&quot;<br/><br/>The situation has left parents scrambling for alternatives. In Ellsworth, parent Rita Boutaugh found herself caught off-guard earlier this year, when her <a href=""https://www.ellsworthamerican.com/maine-news/waitlist-grows-as-y-summer-camp-scrambles-for-staff/"" target=""_blank"">daughter&#39;s day camp was cancelled</a> because it was unable to find enough counselors.<br/><br/>&quot;It was a sickening feeling, knowing that my child wasn&#39;t going to have child care for the next few months, for summer,&quot; she says.<br/><br/>Boutaugh tried holding a sign outside the local grocery store, advertising for the open camp counselor positions. But it didn&#39;t work.<br/><br/>She managed to find a couple other camps for her daughter to attend for a few weeks, and her parents have frequently helped out, too. But on many days, Boutaugh works overnight shifts at the local Shaw&#39;s grocery store so she can care for her daughter.<br/><br/>&quot;Like tonight, I&#39;ll have to go in and work overnight,&quot; she says. &quot;But tomorrow, we&#39;ll spend the day together. So we&#39;re all just compromising, and just trying to make the best of it.&quot;<br/><br/>Summer camps haven&#39;t found any easy solutions, either. Many said they&#39;ve increased pay substantially, but that hasn&#39;t led to many more applications.<br/><br/>Ron Hall, the executive director of the nonprofit Maine Summer Camps, says overnight camps have managed to make up for the shortage by bringing in foreign workers on J-1 visas to fill positions. But he said few day camps have pursued that strategy.<br/><br/>At the YMCA day camp in Auburn, Shea says that he had just spoken with a grandmother who was hoping for her grandchildren to attend the camp. But he says he had to turn her down, which is difficult when so few other child care options exist.<br/><br/>&quot;So it&#39;s a little frustrating. The grandmother I talked to this morning understood,&quot; Shea says. &quot;The kids that we have out here, they&#39;re loving it. They&#39;re having a great time at camp. I just wish more could take advantage of it.&quot;<br/><br/>With the labor market still tight, some camps say they&#39;re planning to start recruiting next summer&#39;s counselors far earlier, in hopes that the additional time will help them find enough staff by the start of camp next year.<br/><br/><i>This story originally appeared on <a href=""https://www.mainepublic.org/business-and-economy/2022-07-15/summer-camps-cant-find-staff-that-means-less-child-care-for-maine-parents"" target=""_blank"">Maine Public</a>.</i>",Robbie Feinberg | Maine Public,Wed Jul 20 05:00:44 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,What’s inside the state Senate’s $4.57 billion economic development bill ,What’s inside the state Senate’s $4.57 billion economic development bill ,"When a $4.3 billion dollar economic bill surfaced in the Massachusetts Senate Thursday morning, Senate Ways and Means Committee Chairman Michael Rodrigues introduced it as “the kitchen sink bill” because of its massive scope.<br/><br/>By the time the bill passed unanimously around 11:30 p.m., there was even more in that figurative sink. Senators bulked up the bill with hundreds of amendments, bringing its total price tag to $4.57 billion and tacking on several new policy measures. <br/><br/>Those amendments include sections to allow tenants to seal their eviction records in certain cases, let cities and towns opt in to allowing happy hour discounts at local restaurants, and permit political candidates to use their campaign funds to pay for child care while running for office.<br/><br/>The Senate rejected an amendment that would let the Massachusetts Lottery sell its products online, a permission the House included in its $4.2 billion version of the bill. That’s one of a slew of differences lawmakers will have to iron out before sending a final product to Gov. Charlie Baker <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2022/07/15/what-to-watch-at-the-end-of-the-massachusetts-legislative-session"">by a July 31 deadline</a>.<br/><br/>Both bills fund their spending through a mix of borrowing, money from last year’s budget surplus, and federal COVID-19 relief funds.

Both bills permanently increase the Earned Income Tax Credit for low and moderate-income workers and offer breaks for seniors, renters and people caring for children or other dependents. Each bill would double the threshold at which the state&#39;s estate tax kicks in from $1 million to $2 million, but differ on the mechanisms for other estate tax reforms. <br/><br/>The Senate&#39;s permanent tax changes would also take effect starting in the 2022 tax year, one year earlier than the House&#39;s plan. <br/><h3>Housing</h3><br/>The Senate bill features $400 million toward housing production, up from $175 million in the House version. Both steer some of their housing money toward an affordable housing trust fund, and the Senate also dedicates $150 million for a workforce housing program. <br/><h3>Child care</h3><br/>Sen. Eric Lesser, the Senate’s Economic Development Committee chairman, said the bill aims to target some of the main costs squeezing family budgets at a time of high inflation. Early education and child care are chief among those expenses, and the Senate’s bill proposes $150 million in stabilization grants for child care providers. <br/><br/>“[For] my family, our child care bill is more than our mortgage and I think that’s not unusual for a lot of young families,” said Lesser, a Longmeadow Democrat who’s running for lieutenant governor. <br/><h3>Health care</h3><br/>Health and human services are a major focus of both the House and Senate bills. Both include millions of dollars in grants for reproductive health care and family planning services and for prevention of gun violence and trauma, but the exact amounts differ. The Senate bumps up the amount of money for financially strained hospitals to $400 million from the House&#39;s $350 million, and both branches allocate $80 million for community health centers.

Article,Casino executives argue sports betting elsewhere is pulling workers out of Massachusetts,Casino executives argue sports betting elsewhere is pulling workers out of Massachusetts,"Gaming industry executives from Plainridge Park Casino, MGM Springfield and Encore Boston Harbor on Monday reminded lawmakers of the &quot;hyper-competitive industry&quot; they operate in and of the ways the state&#39;s prohibition on sports betting is affecting their businesses as the time for legislative negotiators to strike a deal runs short.<br/><br/>The three gambling centers that have opened under the state&#39;s 2011 expanded gaming law told House and Senate members in <a href=""https://wgbh.brightspotcdn.com/f9/ed/84bcb4ba4616a464d026486efb82/07-25casinosletter.pdf"" target=""_blank"">a letter</a> that they have collectively invested more than $4 billion in infrastructure, created more than 12,000 construction jobs, employ about 5,000 Massachusetts residents and have generated more than $1 billion in state tax revenue. But, they said in the letter, the availability of legal sports betting in 35 states — including neighboring New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut and New York — now means that &quot;no resident of the Commonwealth is more than an hour&#39;s drive from a state where legal sports betting is available.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;As a result, our competitors in these states are now offering a significant amenity and service we are prohibited from offering in Massachusetts and capturing the Commonwealth&#39;s entertainment dollars once again,&quot; Encore Boston President Jenny Holaday, MGM Springfield President Chris Kelley and Plainridge Park Vice President and General Manager North Grounsell wrote in a letter that does not press for any specific policy provisions but simply urges lawmakers to legalize sports betting.<br/><br/>The Gaming Commission has kept track of how the workforce at the casinos and slots parlor have bounced back after the pandemic closed all three facilities for about three months, and the operators told lawmakers that not having sports betting &quot;is impacting our ability to build our workforce as employees, despite increased wages, sign-on bonuses and incentives, particularly those working in tipped positions, are choosing to work in venues that draw significantly larger crowds because of sports betting.&quot;<br/><br/>Six lawmakers have been talking since early June to try to find a compromise between the sports betting bill the House passed 156-3 and the version that the Senate passed without any recorded opposition. Senate President Karen Spilka told reporters Monday that she &quot;hope[s] we do get something done.&quot;<br/><br/>Asked whether authorization for betting on college games would be in a final bill — it was not authorized in the Senate&#39;s bill and House Speaker Ron Mariano last year said not having collegiate betting &quot;probably would be&quot; a dealbreaker for him — Spilka said the issue was &quot;up for negotiation.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I really hope that it&#39;s not — the approach is not — an all or nothing bill,&quot; she said.<br/><br/>Spilka opposed the state&#39;s expansion into casino gaming, before playing a lead role in crafting the 2011 expanding gaming law.",Colin A.

Article,'All eyes in the sports-betting business' on Massachusetts as lawmakers seek compromise bill,'All eyes in the sports-betting business' on Massachusetts as lawmakers seek compromise bill,"As Massachusetts legislators face a looming deadline and work behind closed doors to overcome significant differences on a bill that would legalize sports betting in the state, the gaming industry and others focused on gambling are anxiously waiting to see where the chips fall.<br/><br/>&quot;All eyes in the sports-betting business are in Massachusetts this week,&quot; said Casey Clark, senior vice president at the American Gaming Association. <br/><br/>People are already betting on sports in Massachusetts, Clark said. They&#39;re just doing it illegally.<br/><br/>&quot;And what this opportunity creates is a way to drive consumers into a safer, regulated marketplace where there are protections for responsible gaming, for helping them understand how to do this in a way that, you know, is a form of entertainment for people,&quot; he said. &quot;And the illegal market that&#39;s been serving Massachusetts and other jurisdictions across the country for a long time doesn&#39;t have any of those restrictions or regulatory oversight.&quot;<br/><br/>The sports gambling bills passed by both the <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2022/04/28/mass-senate-passes-sports-betting-bill"">Senate</a> and <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2022/05/02/house-speaker-shifts-subtly-on-expectations-for-sports-betting-legislation"">House</a> share many similarities — including allowing people to place bets on sporting events from their phones — but the differences could cause a stalemate. Among the widest gaps between the bills is over the issue of gambling on college sports. The House version includes college sports, and Speaker Ron Mariano has said that&#39;s a crucial element of the legislation, while Senate President Karen Spilka has favored the Senate version, which omits college sports.<br/><br/>Legalizing betting on college sports complicates things, said Paul Debole, an assistant professor of political science at Lasell University, whose research has included a focus on gambling regulation.<br/><br/>&quot;Colleges have been exploiting student athletes for decades as a huge revenue center,&quot; he said. &quot;College sports betting places additional stresses on that system that needs some serious reform. With mobile sports betting basically being an arm&#39;s reach away, how do we make sure that there are people who don&#39;t take advantage of that as well?&quot;<br/><br/>Those protections are possible, said Casey Clark of the American Gaming Association. And it&#39;s not like betting on college sports isn&#39;t already happening, he added.<br/><br/>&quot;Carving out perhaps a more vulnerable population of athletes, more vulnerable competition, away from the regulated marketplace and keeping all of that activity in the illegal, unregulated market, it doesn&#39;t serve anybody&#39;s interests,&quot; he said.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1658865157836,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-e4be-dadb-a77e-f5be3b2c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1658865157836,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-e4be-dadb-a77e-f5be3b2c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000182-3bb7-d99a-a5ef-fbbfd1660003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-6b4a-dfa2-a5cd-ef6a32620003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-86d1-d69c-ade1-b6d937cb0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-be8f-dd35-afcd-ffbf25a40003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-3c0f-d99a-a5ef-ff1f6dab0015&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-3c0f-d99a-a5ef-ff1f6b3a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>In a joint <a href=""https://wgbh.brightspotcdn.com/f9/ed/84bcb4ba4616a464d026486efb82/07-25casinosletter.pdf"">letter</a> this week, the heads of Encore Boston Harbor, MGM Springfield and Plainridge Park Casino <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2022/07/26/casino-executives-argue-sports-betting-elsewhere-is-pulling-workers-out-of-massachusetts"">urged legislators</a> to send a sports betting legislation to the governor to sign.<br/><br/>&quot;Today, 35 states have legalized sports betting, including the neighboring states of Connecticut, New Hampshire, New York, and Rhode Island, and no resident of the Commonwealth is more than an hour’s drive from a state where legal sports betting is available,&quot; they wrote in the letter. &quot;As a result, our competitors in these states are now offering a significant amenity and service we are prohibited from offering in Massachusetts and capturing the Commonwealth’s entertainment dollars once again.&quot;<br/><br/>The casino bosses added that is resulting in a loss of tax revenue for Massachusetts.<br/><br/>&quot;Furthermore, it is impacting our ability to build our workforce as employees, despite increased wages, sign-on bonuses and incentives, particularly those working in tipped positions, are choosing to work in venues that draw significantly larger crowds because of sports betting,&quot; they wrote. &quot;With less than a week remaining in the legislative session, we respectfully implore you to seize on the opportunity to level the playing field in this hyper-competitive industry.&quot;<br/><br/>When legislators first legalized casino gambling in Massachusetts, they required the casino facilities to include staff on-site to help prevent problem gambling. That program, called <a href=""https://www.gamesense.com/"" target=""_blank"">GameSense</a>, offers resources for compulsive gamblers. It&#39;s run by the Massachusetts Council on Gaming and Health, whose executive director, Marlene Warner, said she worries about what would happen if online sports betting were allowed without a version of the program being made available to those gambling remotely.<br/><br/>&quot;[This is] the first way that Massachusetts is in a really massive way going to be moving gambling online,&quot; Warner said. &quot;That requires a fair amount of new approaches to responsible gambling, safer gambling practices. And so my hope is that the Legislature continues to take that seriously. The House put some of that in. The Senate went far beyond the House version. So as they&#39;re in conference committee, I&#39;m hoping those things are really leading some of those conversations.&quot;<br/><br/>As the state considers moving beyond brick-and-mortar facilities, Debole said state lawmakers also must make sure they develop a system that&#39;s fair to the existing casino.<br/><br/>&quot;How do we tax mobile sports betting? Are all betting dollars the same? We have expanded gaming where there&#39;s a 25% daily tax on casino revenues for Encore and MGM, and a 49% daily tax on slot parlor revenues. So how are we going to tax this sports betting? Is the taxation going to be similar? If so, then I think there may be cause for the casino license holders to want to reconsider, perhaps as a equal protection problem, how they&#39;re going to be taxed, too.&quot;<br/><br/>Lawmakers have just days left to reach an agreement if they want to legalize sports betting before the end of the session on July 31.",Craig LeMoult,Tue Jul 26 17:26:43 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Article,"Defying Spilka, senate staffers vow to continue union fight","Defying Spilka, senate staffers vow to continue union fight","<i>Upadated July 29, 6:03 p.m.</i><br/><br/>State Senate staffers seeking to unionize said they are undeterred by Senate President Karen Spilka&#39;s refusal to recognize the union and say they&#39;ll keep up the fight.<br/><br/>Spilka invited staff members to meet with Senate counsel Friday afternoon to discuss a legal review that she said found no path forward for union recognition because of the unique structure of the senate.<br/><br/>Two staffers who attended the closed-door meeting, Morgan Simko and Evan Berry, said afterwards the lawyers identified which state laws create hurdles to union recognition. They said changing those laws is a question of legislators&#39; willpower. <br/><br/>&quot;Ball&#39;s in their court,&quot; Berry said. &quot;If they really want to say to the unions that have supported them election cycle after election cycle that they are pro-labor, they will show up and say, regardless of where you are in Massachusetts, you deserve a union and Beacon Hill is no exception.&quot;<br/><br/>Simko said staff are energized, want to move forward and are talking about their next moves. Many staffers who joined the meeting wore union pins and dressed in red to show solidarity.<br/><br/>As Massachusetts State House staffers buckled down for the last remaining days of the legislative session, Spilka had delivered a decision four months in the making: The Senate would not recognize the legislative staff’s unionization effort. <br/><br/>“The Senate does not at this time see a path forward for a traditional employer-union relationship in the Senate as we are currently structured,” Spilka wrote in an email sent Thursday evening, inviting senators and staff to attend the meeting Friday afternoon to learn more about “an exhaustive review” conducted by Senate counsel on “this complex legal area.” <br/><br/>Staffers first <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2022/04/04/were-not-disposable-massachusetts-senate-staff-move-to-form-union"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>filed a petition to unionize</u></a> with IBEW Local 2222 in late March, joining a wave of legislative union efforts across the country. Though Massachusetts law prohibits legislative staff from collective bargaining, some staffers didn’t buy Spilka’s reasoning for closing the door on the union movement. <br/><br/>“Senators are in the business of making laws. They have the power to make any legislative change that is necessary,” said Berry, a union organizer and communications director for Sen. Becca Rausch. “For them to not act when a majority of their staff has clearly stated that they need the protection of a union is not a question of legality, that is a question of willpower.” <br/><br/>The proposed union effort presents a myriad of issues that extend far beyond existing law, said Senate President Pro Tempore Will Brownsberger. <br/><br/>“Yes, you could change the law, but then you have to think through how that would work,” Brownsberger told GBH News. “All the states in which [legislative] unionization has made some real progress are states which have a different structure from Massachusetts.” <br/><br/>Because Senate staffers work closely and directly with Senators “in a very hand-in-glove way,” Brownsberger said the presence of a union would disrupt the current structure and create ethical issues. <br/><br/>Laws prohibiting conflicts of interest for union officers and members working in government roles were established by the U.S. Department of Labor in the <a href=""https://www.dol.gov/agencies/olms/compliance-assistance/csra/fact-sheet#:~:text=Prohibition%20of%20Conflicts%20of%20Interest,fiduciary%20obligation%20to%20the%20union."" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>Civil Service Reform Act of 1978</u></a>, which put a finer point on regulations established in the <a href=""https://www.dol.gov/agencies/olms/laws/labor-management-reporting-and-disclosure-act"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959</u></a>. Still, Brownsberger said he’s wary of staff involvement with the IBEW, which publicly lobbies on issues including environmental policymaking through the union’s Government Affairs Department and <a href=""https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/international-brotherhood-of-electrical-workers/C00027342/candidate-recipients/2020"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>contributes donations to political campaigns and Political Action Committees</u></a>. <br/><br/>“There would be a whole lot of conflict of interest issues if they&#39;re working with a union who has its own political agenda,” Brownsberger said. “You can&#39;t have people serving multiple masters, that’s just not acceptable.” <br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1659086719909,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1659086719909,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;Related Stories:&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017f-f114-d821-a37f-fbb75bc80003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-b093-dd12-a59b-fbfb79380003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-3780-d887-adfb-779ad1c80000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-4943-d486-a9e2-d9f332080006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-4943-d486-a9e2-d9f32f360000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>Because state senators are elected every two years and often bring in their own staff, Brownsberger said the process of renegotiating a union contract would be “an incredible amount of work” to do every two years. <br/><br/>“You know, we actually have other things to do here, things that are difficult,” Brownsberger said. “We&#39;re not just here to negotiate a new deal every few years and talk about how we&#39;re going to operate.”<br/><br/>After years of failed attempts at unionization and a four-month period waiting for Spilka’s response, pro-union staffers have made it clear: they want to talk about how the Senate is going to operate.<br/><br/>The decision not to recognize the union was described as “retraumatizing” by a former Beacon Hill legislative aide who was <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2018/07/06/rosenberg-and-estranged-husband-hefner-want-alleged-sexual-assault-victim-publicly-named"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>sexually assaulted by Bryon Hefner</u></a>, the estranged husband of former Senate President Stan Rosenberg. In 2019, Hefner pleaded guilty to charges of sexual assault, distributing nude photos and criminal lewdness, following a lengthy trial that highlighted cultural issues at the state house. Rosenberg stepped down as Senate President in 2018 following a scathing <a href=""https://malegislature.gov/Bills/190/S2510.pdf"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>report from the Senate Ethics Committee</u></a>. <br/><br/>“It’s a deep betrayal to the current and former staff who work in conditions where their safety is not a priority,” the former aide told GBH News. “The power dynamics in that building are insidious and people sometimes are forced to compromise their safety and their protection in order to protect their career.”<br/><br/>When Spilka was elected to replace Rosenberg, she vowed to make workplace culture issues a <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2019/01/22/senate-president-spilka-workplace-culture-a-major-priority"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>“major priority”</u></a> for her office, and created a commission to look into sexual misconduct. In 2020, she appointed Diana Kasule as human resources manager of diversity, equity and inclusion for the Senate.<br/><br/>Despite changes made since the Rosenberg days, union organizers maintain that union representation is the only way to amend “decades-old issues” in the state house, including calls for an independent human resources department: currently, the human resources department and Senate counsel are overseen by the Senate president and are not independent entities. <br/><br/>“They hold Stan Rosenberg accountable because it was becoming a political issue for them, but then it didn&#39;t fundamentally change much, people still have nowhere to turn,” the former Beacon Hill aide told GBH News. “Who do you go to if the Senate president harasses you? Or the Senate president’s husband?” <br/><br/>In early April, State House Employee Union organizers secured support from a majority of the nearly 300-person workforce and <a href=""https://statehouseemployeeunion.org/elementor-509/"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>set goals</u></a> for better pay and benefits, a more transparent and equitable pay structure and a workplace free from sexual harassment and identity-based discrimination.<br/><br/>Additional changes have come from Senate leadership since then: last month, Spilka announced an upgraded pay scale that will provide Senate staffers with a mandated starting annual salary of $50,138 and a salary increase of at least 10%. The pay bump comes in response to a November 2021 report from the National Conference of State Legislatures that detailed a “mysterious” compensation structure, fraught with discrepancies and inequity across positions.<br/><br/>&quot;This party does have the ability to self-correct,&quot; Brownsberger said, and has come a long way since the days of Rosenberg. <br/><br/>“Are we perfect? No place is perfect, and we have to keep listening, and the Senate president has been doing that.” Brownsberger said. “Perfect? No. But it’s a heck of a lot better than it was.” <br/><br/>In a statement, organizers for the State House Employees Union said they plan to meet with staff in the next few days to plan next steps, adding that “our pursuit of an equal, just, and supportive legislative workplace is just the beginning.” ","Tori Bedford, Katie Lannan",Fri Jul 29 07:53:37 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,There's a familiar ring to the latest Dershowitz controversy on Martha's Vineyard,There's a familiar ring to the latest Dershowitz controversy on Martha's Vineyard,"It’s deja vu all over again on Martha’s Vineyard where Harvard emeritus Professor Alan Dershowitz is giving a repeat performance from the summer of 2018. In case you’ve forgotten, he made national news back then complaining that his work with former President Donald Trump had made him a pariah among the social set. <br/><br/>Here’s part of what I said in my July 2018 commentary titled <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/commentary/2018/07/22/dont-cry-for-alan-dershowitz"">Don’t Cry for Alan Dershowitz</a>: &quot;My take on shunning, the political divide, invites to Martha’s Vineyard dinner parties, and Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz. Before you say it, yes there are many other more serious issues to discuss, but this drama keeps unfolding right in my backyards — I live in Cambridge and I spend as much time as possible on Martha’s Vineyard. Dershowitz complained that … he was being shunned and disinvited from dinner parties on Martha’s Vineyard because he championed &#39;Trump’s civil liberties.&#39; The avalanche of reaction to what many called whining stirred up long-held personal antipathy, and recently rising political distaste for Dershowitz.&quot;<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1659206578132,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1659206578132,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;Related commentaries&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000164-b81c-d791-a7e5-b97f11df0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000016a-d1d3-d17f-adea-f3fbad520003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-3781-d887-adfb-779b94e80000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-5067-d486-a9e2-d0f7002a000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-5066-d486-a9e2-d0f6ff500000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>Fast forward to 2022 and Dershowitz is an even more vigorous defender of the former president, though he claims he only votes for liberal Democrats, including Hillary Clinton. No matter. Plenty of Vineyarders are open about scratching him from the dinner party lists where he once was an honored guest. His response? To up the manufactured controversy ante from his 2018 whines of shunning to his 2022 bloviating about being canceled by people he describes as anti-free speech. That’s why the bellicose barrister has threatened to sue the Chilmark Free Library for taking him off a list of this summer’s scheduled speakers. <br/><br/>Chilmark librarian Ebba Hierta explained — <a href=""https://www.mvtimes.com/2019/08/28/cloud-controversy-follows-alan-dershowitz/"" target=""_blank"">as she did in 2018</a> — that the library space seats 40, too small for his sure-to-be overflow crowd. But, this time, the controversy prompted hate mail from someone identifying as a member of the Proud Boys, the far-right domestic terrorist group. Hierta says she was so frightened that she installed burglar bars on her home windows. <br/><br/>Hushed and whispered past criticisms of Dershowitz are now loud and public. Uber producer, writer, and comedian Larry David of the popular TV show,” Curb Your Enthusiasm” sharply dismissed him at a popular gathering spot. And the back-and-forth opinions about professor Dershowitz in the Martha’s Vineyard Times newspaper got so heated on one story, news editor George Brennan announced he was shutting off the comments. <br/><br/>Finally, I will point out that author-professor Dershowitz’ latest hyperventilated cancel culture pronouncements seemed perfectly timed to the release of his latest book. Just as his provocative statements in 2018 were published just before the release of his book, “The Case Against Impeaching Trump.&quot;<br/><br/>So, everything old is new again in this latest episode of Alan Dershowitz: I’ve Been Criticized and Canceled. The aggrieved professor told the New Yorker magazine’s Isaac Chotiner that he’d been besieged with calls this summer from people wanting to hear him speak, <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/alan-dershowitzs-marthas-vineyard-cancellation"" target=""_blank"">telling the columnist</a>, “The audiences are being deprived of my voice as the result of a deliberate cancellation decision.” <br/><br/>He may yet find his place on a stage somewhere on the island, but I don’t see him getting him any closer to an invite for the clambake.",Callie Crossley,Mon Aug 01 05:00:58 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,Unionized Starbucks workers ready for legal battle with coffee giant over ongoing strikes,Unionized Starbucks workers ready for legal battle with coffee giant over ongoing strikes,"After 16 days of picketing outside their Starbucks location in Brookline, recently unionized baristas are preparing for a legal battle with the corporation over the strike.<br/><br/>Last month, 20 employees at the Starbucks location at 874 Commonwealth Ave. hung up their aprons and set up a picket line to demand a stop to what they say is retaliation from Starbucks since the shop became one of the first to successfully unionize in June. Employee filed multiple complaints with the National Labor Relations Board alleging intimidation, increased surveillance and cutting of hours. They say they plan to continue picketing until the company provides guaranteed stable shifts and replaces the current manager.<br/><br/><a href=""https://one.starbucks.com/get-the-facts-the-strike-at-847-commonwealth-boston/"" target=""_blank"">Starbucks responded to the strike with a statement</a> saying it has the legal right &quot;to hire permanent replacements for striking workers under certain circumstances (such as an indefinite strike).&quot; The company added it is “hopeful” replacing workers “will not become necessary in this case.” <br/><br/>Employees in Brookline say they have been meeting with officials from the National Labor Relations Board this week<b> </b>to prepare for what could become an unprecedented legal battle. Baristas argue that the strike was launched over unfair labor practices, which would mean replacing striking workers would be illegal. Starbucks disagrees.<br/><br/>“The employees are saying it’s about labor conditions, and it seems like Starbucks is saying it’s just about milking more money from [Starbucks CEO] Howard Schultz,” GBH Legal Analyst Daniel Medwed said. “There&#39;s probably a looming legal battle over the nature of this strike, whether it&#39;s about money or about conditions.” <br/><br/>If Starbucks brings in new employees to permanently replace the striking workers, the union — represented by labor union Workers United — could sue the company and bring an injunction to enjoin Starbucks to stop bringing in replacements, Medwed said. <br/><br/>“At that point, a judge would have to decide what type of strike this is,” he said. “Because this is now the longest Starbucks strike in the country, we find ourselves on unprecedented ground.

In June, Beverly Hospital, where the center operates, announced plans to close it in September, citing staffing shortages. The center has been open in Beverly for 42 years and is the last birth center operating in Eastern Massachusetts. The center’s midwives offer holistic prenatal and birth care. <br/><br/>In a letter to hospital staff Thursday, Beverly Hospital president Tom Sands stated the hospital’s intentions to “extend the review process” into the closure of the center. <br/><br/>“Doing so will give us the opportunity to bring together leaders from Beverly Hospital, Beth Israel Lahey Health, state public health officials, local elected leaders and members of the community to further discuss the complex challenges associated with feasibly operating the NSBC for the long-term,” he wrote in the letter.<br/><br/>When closing plans were announced in June, a <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2022/06/13/activists-rally-to-save-the-north-shore-birth-center-again"">large outcry from community members,</a> including members of the Massachusetts congressional delegation, followed. <br/><br/>Rep. Ayanna Pressley tweeted, &quot;we should be using every tool available to expand &amp; improve access to [reproductive] care — not slash it&quot; and linked to a story about the planned closure. Supporters emphasized that the center was one of only a few places for low-cost midwifery-based births in the state, and the closure would disproportionately hurt low-income families and women of color. <br/><br/>Rebecca Hains, professor of media and communication at Salem State University and member of the Campaign to Save the North Shore Birth Center, gave birth to her first child there in 2008. <br/><br/>She attended the recent Department of Public Health hearing in July about the closure. “We have lots of testimony at this point from midwives who worked there previously, even former directors of the birth center,” Hains said about advocacy efforts to keep the center open. <br/><br/>Emilee Regan, spokesperson for the Campaign to Save the North Shore Birth Center, said the pause is just the first step towards ensuring the center&#39;s long-term presence. <br/><br/>“We want the birth center to be open to all patients, to be fully-staffed and to be fully-resourced. To pause the path forward to a closure is a great first step, but we have a lot of work to do,” Reagan said. <br/><br/><i>Produced with assistance from the <a href=""https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpmja.org%2Fpmja-editor-corps%2F&amp;data=05%7C01%7Csmccloskey%40vpm.org%7C98abd9fd95a2484bc57708da22495561%7Ca9b814cd8a9542789b5a7a9b68ebf5c1%7C0%7C0%7C637859995627735225%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C2000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=hif8N4HHCK%2BIPZlnd25dGv9puD%2B5VZ3ervIq7bCatIk%3D&amp;reserved=0"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">Public Media Journalists Association Editor Corps</a> funded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a private corporation funded by the American people.</i>",Fernando Cervantes Jr.,Fri Aug 05 17:22:52 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,Former Peabody gym teacher accused of sexually abusing students ,Former Peabody gym teacher accused of sexually abusing students ,"Thirteen former students claim they were sexually abused by longtime Peabody gym teacher and coach James Toltz.<br/><br/>Lawyers for the alleged victims filed a class action lawsuit in Middlesex Superior Court on Tuesday. They are also suing the city of Peabody for intentionally preventing disclosure of Toltz&#39;s abuse, which the lawsuit said spanned his decades-long career in education. Neither Toltz, who now lives in Winter Garden, Florida, nor city officials responded to requests for comment on the case. <br/><br/>Toltz worked as a physical education teacher at Higgins Middle School and the John F. Kennedy Junior High School between 1969 and 1996, according to the suit. During this time, he allegedly forced minors as young as age 11 to shower naked while he watched, and introduced adolescents to drugs and alcohol in school or at his home. The lawsuit described disturbing encounters with middle and high schoolers that involved spanking, forced oral sex, rape and assault.<br/><br/>“Being a gym teacher and a coach, he was in a unique position to have boys undressed, to have situations where it seemed to the boys maybe somewhat normal,” said Carmen L. Durso, one of the plaintiffs&#39; lawyers. &quot;I&#39;ve had people tell me that he would create situations in which it would be necessary for him to make a general examination.”<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1660775106567,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1660775106567,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000182-a66e-d717-a3c7-e6fe0f5d0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000182-3757-d99a-a5ef-f75f95e90001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000178-9274-d798-a1fa-def4b9110000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a110002&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-ade5-d33d-a1f2-efe7e88f0028&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-ade5-d33d-a1f2-efe7e7ca0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>During a Wednesday press conference on Zoom organized by the plaintiffs&#39; lawyers, Durso and Michael J.

I rarely thought about this abuse, and I think I may not even have been aware of it,” he said. “When I hear someone sniffing, especially when it&#39;s cold, it brings back what he did to me. He was sniffing through his cocaine-encrusted nostril, and it&#39;s a sound I cannot escape.”<br/><br/>The wife of a man identified as John Doe #1008 read an emotional statement on behalf of her husband. <br/><br/>“I wish to reach out to another set of James Toltz&#39;s victims, his colleagues in the authorities of the City of Peabody. He stole your integrity,” the statement said. “You who at the time and for whatever your motivation, chose to turn a blind eye in the self preserving effort to deny moral culpability for his crimes that as a result, was allowed to span decades.”<br/><br/>The complaint estimated that as many as 150 other students may have been similarly abused by the former teacher.

Article,'The taxpayers have lawyered up': Legal teams ready to defend 1980s law,'The taxpayers have lawyered up': Legal teams ready to defend 1980s law,"Should Beacon Hill officials try to duck the tax relief requirements of Chapter 62F over the next month, at least two groups of taxpayers, newly including one supported by major right-leaning groups like Citizens for Limited Taxation, have organized themselves to be prepared to ask the state&#39;s court system to step in.<br/><br/>&quot;The taxpayers have lawyered up,&quot; Dan Winslow, a former judge, Romney administration official and state representative who now leads the New England Legal Foundation, said Monday.<br/><br/>A 1986 ballot question initiated by Citizens for Limited Taxation and its subsequent law, Chapter 62F, created an annual state tax revenue growth limit based on the level of growth in total wages and salaries of Massachusetts citizens. If the state collects more than the allowed amount of tax revenue in any one fiscal year, the law says that the overage is to be returned to taxpayers. The late-July revelation that 62F <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2022/07/28/mass-taxpayers-will-get-billions-back-under-obscure-1980s-law-baker-says"">could eat up some of the state&#39;s $5-plus billion surplus from fiscal 2022</a> derailed the Legislature&#39;s own tax relief plan and a massive economic development bill.<br/><br/>The law allows a group of at least 24 &quot;taxable inhabitants&quot; of Massachusetts to petition the Supreme Judicial Court or Superior Court to enforce the provisions of Chapter 62F, and at least two parallel efforts are afoot on that front in the event that officials attempt to evade the requirements of the law.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#39;re aware that the auditor is receiving significant political pressure to delay the certification with the thought that the Legislature would repeal the statute when they come back into session at the top of the new session and there&#39;s even talk about possibly having the Legislature come into session now to repeal the law as part of another package,&quot; Winslow said during a press conference Monday to announce that the Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance, the Fiscal Alliance Foundation and Citizens for Limited Taxation had partnered with the New England Legal Foundation and the Goldwater Institute to prepare to bring suit to enforce Chapter 62F.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1661263044429,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1661263044429,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000182-457d-d758-a5aa-477d45700003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000182-5962-db35-a3de-ffe27c6d0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000182-6588-d463-abf3-77cd34170003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-cafd-d5d3-a796-faffacd70024&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-cafd-d5d3-a796-faffabc20000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>The commissioner of revenue is required by Sept. 1 to send the state auditor a report of the net state tax revenue and the allowable state tax revenue for the fiscal year that ended June 30. By the third Tuesday of September — Sept. 20 this year — the auditor must &quot;independently determine&quot; whether tax collections exceeded that allowable amount and then notify the executive branch, House and Senate of the amount of the overage. The auditor&#39;s determination &quot;shall be conclusive,&quot; the law states.<br/><br/>There has been no indication from Auditor Suzanne Bump that she intends to depart from the required timeline and her office has said it cannot prepare its report until it receives the necessary information from DOR. But lawmakers, chiefly House Speaker Ronald Mariano, have suggested that they might try to tinker with Chapter 62F in some fashion. Mariano also, however, has called 62F &quot;the law of the land and it&#39;s going to happen.&quot;<br/><br/>Republican auditor candidate Anthony Amore <a href=""https://amore2022.com/2022/08/amore-launches-taxpayer-petition-invites-democratic-opponents-to-sign-on/"" style=""color: rgb(0, 106, 199); text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-skip-ink: none;"">announced</a> on Aug. 4 that he had lined up at least 24 taxpayers &quot;who stand ready to file a petition with the state&#39;s highest court should Auditor Suzanne Bump fail to act with urgency in certifying billions of dollars in tax rebates under the state&#39;s Chapter 62F law.&quot;<br/><br/>On Monday, Amore announced that former U.S. attorney Michael Sullivan will provide legal representation to his taxpayer petition effort. Sullivan and Winslow ran against each other (and both came up short against Gabriel Gomez) in the 2013 Republican primary for the U.S. Senate seat that John Kerry resigned.<br/><br/>&quot;With record inflation straining the budgets of working families, I share Anthony&#39;s belief that our state government must respect the decision of the voters across the Commonwealth to quickly get tax rebate checks in the hands of residents,&quot; Sullivan, the father of Rep. Alyson Sullivan, said. &quot;If the State Auditor does not do her job and move swiftly and accurately through this certification process, our coalition will file an enforcement action with the Supreme Judicial Court.&quot;<br/><br/>The latest group of more than 24 individuals lined up as plaintiffs includes people from each Massachusetts county and is made up of representatives of Citizens for Limited Taxation, Mass Fiscal, Beacon Hill Institute, the local chapter of the National Federation of Independent Businesses, and the Mass. High Technology Council.<br/><br/>&quot;While we expect the Auditor to continue to comply with the certification requirements, taxpayers have promised to uphold the will of Massachusetts voters by seeking to enforce these critically important and statutorily guaranteed fiscal safeguards, demanding the government follow the law,&quot; MassFiscal said in a press release. &quot;Should it become clear that Massachusetts officials are seeking to sidestep the plainly laid out requirements of Chapter 62F, taxpayers have promised to uphold the will of Massachusetts voters by seeking to enforce these critically important and statutorily guaranteed fiscal safeguards.&quot;<br/><br/>Chip Ford, executive director of Citizens for Limited Taxation, said Monday that the difference between Amore&#39;s effort and the one he is involved with &quot;is [that] ours is comprised of the original supporters, the original organizations who went to the ballot in 1986, put it on the ballot, ran a campaign, and won the surtax repeal and the tax cap. And that&#39;s Citizens for Limited Taxation, my organization, and the Mass. High Tech Council.&quot;<br/><br/>Paul Craney, a spokesman for Mass Fiscal, said the group wanted to hold its press conference Monday because they are about one month out from when they would expect to file a lawsuit, if necessary.<br/><br/>Winslow said his organization is particularly interested in exploring the idea that the relief afforded by Chapter 62F &quot;could already be a vested property right in the hands of the taxpayers to which they&#39;re entitled&quot; regardless of any attempts to amend the law.<br/><br/>&quot;There&#39;s a significant question that this actually may already be a done deal as a matter of law,&quot; he said. Winslow added later, &quot;Basically, what remains at this point is what we call a ministerial act. It&#39;s simply almost an automatic kind of a certification because the close of the fiscal year was June 30 and so the condition that this statute applies to already existed as a matter of fact.&quot;<br/><br/>Chapter 62F also requires that the auditor&#39;s determination that net state tax revenue exceed the allowable amount &quot;shall result in a credit equal to the total amount of such excess&quot; and that the &quot;credit shall be applied to the then current personal income tax liability of all taxpayers on a proportional basis to the personal income tax liability incurred by all taxpayers in the immediately preceding taxable year.&quot;<br/><br/>But that may not be how things play out. The Baker administration has been quietly working behind the scenes to change the regulations around Chapter 62F since this spring and his budget chief said when the 36-year-old law&#39;s impact on the fiscal year 2022 surplus came to light that he was already &quot;looking at what&#39;s the quickest and most efficient way to get that money back to the taxpayers.&quot; Baker said two weeks ago that he &quot;expect[s] that people will be receiving their refund sometime between the end of November and the beginning of December,&quot; which wouldn&#39;t line up with a credit applied to personal income tax liability but would mean the money would go out before he leaves office.<br/><br/>During a press conference Monday, representatives of some of the groups prepared to sue to make sure that Chapter 62F is followed to the letter of the law did not express strong opinions one way or another as to how the money is returned to taxpayers and even suggested they would be open to some Legislative alterations to 62F.<br/><br/>&quot;If the law were to change to give money back directly rather than a credit for future taxes, you know, as long as the law is being followed, that&#39;s our interest,&quot; Winslow said. He then added, &quot;We care that the law on the books is followed ... if the law is amended by the Legislature to change the form of the payment, you know, that&#39;s the law.&quot;<br/><br/>Ford, who was part of the 1986 ballot push, said Citizens for Limited Taxation had to make sure that its initiative petition did not appropriate funds, or else it would have been deemed unconstitutional and wouldn&#39;t have made it to the ballot.<br/><br/>&quot;So we used the term credit. We didn&#39;t use it in the accepted sense that it can only be returned as a tax credit in future years, though that was the way it was interpreted in 1987. Nonetheless, our use of credit was that the taxpayers would receive a refund,&quot; he said.<br/><br/>The only time the excess revenue cap was hit, in fiscal 1987, the $29.22 million in credits was made available to taxpayers through the addition of a line on the 1987 Massachusetts individual income tax return &quot;upon which each individual taxpayer could insert their individually calculated share of the $29,221,675 credit,&quot; the auditor&#39;s office said.<br/><br/>DOR this spring began the process of repealing the regulation that governs how a taxpayer obtains a credit toward personal income tax liability under Chapter 62F with the agency saying that it is &quot;obsolete&quot; because no credit had been required since 1987.<br/><br/>The Executive Office of Administration and Finance said Monday that the regulation had not yet been officially rescinded. A Baker administration official previously said that DOR will &quot;issue relevant guidance or regulations for this year&#39;s implementation&quot; if Chapter 62F is triggered.<br/>",Colin A.

Article,One graduate's story proves Biden's student loan forgiveness plan isn't a comprehensive solution,One graduate's story proves Biden's student loan forgiveness plan isn't a comprehensive solution,"Since he graduated from UMass Amherst in 2013, Shane O’Brien has been focused on paying back his student loan debt. Now his nine-year effort has gotten a big boost from President Joe Biden, who last week <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2022/08/24/biden-announces-sweeping-student-debt-cancellations"">signed off on a loan forgiveness program</a> of $10,000 per borrower for those making under $125,000 a year. Shane is elated that he qualifies, telling me, “It’s good because it will wipe out about $2,000 of my remaining federal loans.” <br/><br/>However, that doesn’t mean he’s debt free. Like some of the 43 million burdened by student loan debt, his major expense “are private student loans.”<br/><br/>Still, Shane is currently in a much better position than a lot of student loan borrowers who, on average, <a href=""https://educationdata.org/student-loan-debt-statistics"" target=""_blank"">carry $41,000 of debt</a> — <a href=""https://educationdata.org/student-loan-debt-by-race"" target=""_blank"">that’s $52,000 for Black borrowers</a>. But just four years ago, his struggle to manage his debt landed him in the Brockton Enterprise newspaper. His story made news when he attempted to persuade his employer, the city of Brockton, to allow him to waive the residential living requirement. With Excel sheets in hand, Shane explained to Brockton City Council members his plan to move in with his parents in Newport, Rhode Island, so he could live rent-free and apply the savings to pay down his debt. Three city councilors voted yes, but the six-member majority said no.<br/><br/>I took notice of Shane’s story back in 2018 and recently followed up with him. A year after the Council’s no vote, he left his Brockton staff planner job for a better paying and more advanced position as Everett’s land use planner. Next stop Framingham, where he moved up to senior planner. He and the woman who became his fiancée moved in together and shared expenses. And he kept making payments during the government-sanctioned payment pause which began in March 2020. A pause President Biden has announced will continue through the end of this year.<br/><br/>With sacrifice and career success, Shane successfully trimmed $15,000 of his $70,000 in private loans, in addition to a near payoff of his $8,000 federal loan, despite rising interest rates which he says drive &quot;profiteering&quot; in student loans.&quot; He had long hoped for the cap on interest rates that is part of the Biden loan forgiveness plan.<br/><br/>Five months ago, Shane O’Brien moved up another career rung as Bridgewater’s town planner, the top planning job in the city. He’s doing work he describes as his “calling”; he and his now wife are active citizens in Taunton where they have purchased a home. Two life passages he knows many of his debt-saddled former college classmates have been forced to delay. While he’s glad so many will get relief from the president’s loan forgiveness, he admits “this is a not a permanent solution.&quot;",Callie Crossley,Mon Aug 29 05:00:55 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,How to avoid getting 'Storrowed' on move-in day,How to avoid getting 'Storrowed' on move-in day,"With the most common annual move-in season underway, it’s become inevitable for some drivers to fall victim to getting “Storrowed” — the common term for when a box truck crashes or gets stuck under a low-clearance bridge on Storrow Drive. <a href=""https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2021/08/19/boston-storrowing-what-to-know/"">It happens so often</a> that Bostonians may use &quot;Storrowing&quot; to refer to a stuck truck on other low-clearance routes, such as Memorial Drive and Soldiers Field Road along the Charles River, where one U-Haul lost its roof earlier today.<br/><bsp-raw-html html=""&lt;blockquote class=\&quot;twitter-tweet\&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=\&quot;en\&quot; dir=\&quot;ltr\&quot;&gt;\uD83D\uDE9A\uD83D\uDCA5 &lt;a href=\&quot;https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/Storrowing?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\&quot;&gt;#Storrowing&lt;\/a&gt; on Soldiers Field Road eastbound in &lt;a href=\&quot;https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/Boston?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\&quot;&gt;#Boston&lt;\/a&gt; tore the roof off this moving truck. &lt;a href=\&quot;https:\/\/twitter.com\/MassDOT?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\&quot;&gt;@MassDOT&lt;\/a&gt; said the bridge was inspected and no damage was found. &lt;a href=\&quot;https:\/\/t.co\/TCDawmKyel\&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com\/TCDawmKyel&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&amp;mdash; WCVB-TV Boston (@WCVB) &lt;a href=\&quot;https:\/\/twitter.com\/WCVB\/status\/1565370787183448064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\&quot;&gt;September 1, 2022&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=\&quot;https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\&quot; charset=\&quot;utf-8\&quot;&gt;&lt;\/script&gt;"">Raw Html</bsp-raw-html><br/><br/>While seasoned Bostonians know to avoid these roadways while driving a moving truck, those less familiar with the region won’t find warnings about low clearance routes on common navigation apps like Google Maps or Waze. But drivers can use truck navigations apps — including one created in Boston with Storrow Drive in mind — to prevent them from getting stuck.<br/><br/>Truck-focused navigation apps including TruckMap, Hammer, TruckerPath and SmartTruckRoute all allow users to enter the height of their vehicle in order to only receive routes that fit that vehicle’s configuration. SmartTruckRoute also has an alert system, so if a driver enters an unsafe road, the app will issue a warning that they need to find a different route.<br/><br/>“It&#39;ll just beg them. It&#39;ll say, look, you really need to get out,” said Marleen Winer, vice president of TeleType Co., the Boston-based company behind the navigation app. &quot;Then eventually it will stop [offering directions for that route].&quot;<br/> <br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1662066701199,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1662066701199,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-3780-d887-adfb-779a57020000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-3781-d887-adfb-779b5e770000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-fae2-d5d3-a796-fae31d2f0028&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-fae2-d5d3-a796-fae31c370000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>Winer said Storrow Drive was the first test in ensuring their app took trucks on safe routes.<br/><br/>“Being that we&#39;re based in New England, there&#39;s a lot of material, there&#39;s a lot of data and there&#39;s a great need for it,” she said. “I mean, every year people make mistakes and there are people that come from New York and they get stuck on Storrow because they think they can go there even though there&#39;s warnings.”<br/><br/>The Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, responsible for managing Storrow Drive, stated in a <a href=""https://www.mass.gov/news/state-officials-remind-public-of-roadway-height-restrictions-for-move-in-day"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" data-auth=""NotApplicable"" data-safelink=""true"" data-linkindex=""0"" style=""border: 0px; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(5, 99, 193); text-decoration: underline;"">press release</a> Tuesday that they increased signage throughout the area of Storrow Drive and conducted outreach to truck rental companies, moving companies and educational institutions to raise awareness about roadway height restrictions. <br/><br/>State officials recommend than anyone renting a truck check their route ahead of time to ensure the vehicle could fit. And once they&#39;re on the road, police say drivers should pay close attention to signs warning about height restrictions so they don&#39;t get stuck and are forced to back out.<br/><br/>“The instances of bridge strikes by overheight rental trucks each fall is as preventable as it is predictable,” said Massachusetts State Police Superintendent Col. Christopher Mason said in a press release.<br/><br/>But it&#39;s not just moving trucks that are the problem. Chris Amaral, founder of Safe Responsible Movers in Allston, wrote in an email that his company has never had a truck hit a bridge on Storrow Drive. He thinks many incidents of “Storrowing” are the fault of professional drivers from outside of Boston who aren’t familiar with local truck limitations, not just college students moving to the city.<br/><br/>Because his drivers are local to Boston and are trained to avoid Storrow Drive, Amaral wrote that they use regular GPS systems to navigate, not any special software.",Haley Lerner,Thu Sep 01 17:11:50 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As Princess Elizabeth, she made her first public broadcast in 1940 when she was 14, sending a wartime message to children evacuated to the countryside or overseas.<br/><br/>“We children at home are full of cheerfulness and courage,” she said with a blend of stoicism and hope that would echo throughout her reign. “We are trying to do all we can to help out gallant soldiers, sailors and airmen. And we are trying, too, to bear our own share of the danger and sadness of war. We know, every one of us, that in the end all will be well.”<br/><br/>Since Feb. 6, 1952, Elizabeth reigned over a Britain that rebuilt from war and lost its empire; joined the European Union and then left it; and transformed from industrial powerhouse to uncertain 21st century society. She endured through 15 prime ministers, from Winston Churchill to Liz Truss, becoming an institution and an icon — a fixed point and a reassuring presence even for those who ignored or loathed the monarchy.<br/><br/>She became less visible in her final years as age and frailty curtailed many public appearances. But she remained firmly in control of the monarchy and at the center of national life as Britain celebrated her Platinum Jubilee with days of parties and pageants in June 2022.<br/><br/>The same month she became the second longest-reigning monarch in history, behind 17th-century French King Louis XIV, who took the throne at age 4. On Sept. 6, 2022, she presided at a ceremony at Balmoral Castle to accept the resignation of Boris Johnson as prime minister and appoint Truss as his successor.<br/><br/>When Elizabeth was 21, almost five years before she became queen, she promised the people of Britain and the Commonwealth that “my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service.”<br/><br/>It was a promise she kept across more than seven decades.<br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1662659953163,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1662659953163,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000183-1e40-d5d3-a797-7ee3e61e0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;FILE - Britain&amp;#39;s Queen Elizabeth II, looks through a window at the view as she walks through The Queen&amp;#39;s Diamond Jubilee Galleries at Westminster Abbey in London, Friday, June 8, 2018.&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-1e40-d5d3-a797-7ee3db0c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:&quot;/enhancement/EnhancementCentered.hbs&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-1e40-d5d3-a797-7ee3dadd0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">Britain Jubilee</bsp-image><br/><br/>Despite Britain’s complex and often fraught ties with its former colonies, Elizabeth was widely respected and remained head of state of more than a dozen countries, from Canada to Tuvalu. She headed the 54-nation Commonwealth, built around Britain and its former colonies.<br/><br/>Married for more than 73 years to Prince Philip, who died in 2021 at age 99, Elizabeth was matriarch to a royal family whose troubles were a subject of global fascination — amplified by fictionalized accounts such as TV series “The Crown.” She is survived by four children, eight grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.<br/><br/>Through countless public events, she probably met more people than anyone in history. Her image, which adorned stamps, coins and banknotes, was among the most reproduced in the world.<br/><br/>But her inner life and opinions remained mostly an enigma. Of her personality, the public saw relatively little. A horse owner, she rarely seemed happier than during the Royal Ascot racing week. She never tired of the companionship of her beloved Welsh corgi dogs.<br/><br/>Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor was born in London on April 21, 1926, the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York. She was not born to be queen — her father’s elder brother, Prince Edward, was destined for the crown, to be followed by any children he had.<br/><br/>But in 1936, when she was 10, Edward VIII abdicated to marry twice-divorced American Wallis Simpson, and Elizabeth’s father became King George VI.<br/><br/>Princess Margaret recalled asking her sister whether this meant that Elizabeth would one day be queen. ”’Yes, I suppose it does,‘” Margaret quoted Elizabeth as saying. “She didn’t mention it again.”<br/><br/>Elizabeth was barely in her teens when Britain went to war with Germany in 1939. While the king and queen stayed at Buckingham Palace during the Blitz and toured the bombed-out neighborhoods of London, Elizabeth and Margaret spent most of the war at Windsor Castle, west of the capital. Even there, 300 bombs fell in an adjacent park, and the princesses spent many nights in an underground shelter.<br/><br/>In 1945, after months of campaigning for her parents’ permission to do something for the war effort, the heir to the throne became Second Subaltern Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. She enthusiastically learned to drive and service heavy vehicles.<br/><br/>On the night the war ended in Europe, May 8, 1945, she and Margaret managed to mingle, unrecognized, with celebrating crowds in London — “swept along on a tide of happiness and relief,” as she told the BBC decades later, describing it as “one of the most memorable nights of my life.”<br/><br/>At Westminster Abbey in November 1947 she married Royal Navy officer Philip Mountbatten, a prince of Greece and Denmark whom she had first met in 1939 when she was 13 and he 18. Postwar Britain was experiencing austerity and rationing, and so street decorations were limited and no public holiday was declared. But the bride was allowed 100 extra ration coupons for her trousseau.<br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1662659709639,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1662659709639,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000183-1e3d-d33d-a1f3-7e3f30370001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;FILE - Britain&amp;#39;s Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh wave to the crowds from the balcony of Buckingham Palace in London, after their wedding, Nov. 20, 1947.&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-1e3d-d5d3-a797-7eff212b0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-1e3d-d5d3-a797-7eff20ff0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">Britain Queen Elizabeth II Timeline </bsp-image><br/>The couple lived for a time in Malta, where Philip was stationed, and Elizabeth enjoyed an almost-normal life as a navy wife. The first of their four children, Prince Charles, was born on Nov. 14, 1948. He was followed by Princess Anne on Aug. 15, 1950, Prince Andrew on Feb. 19, 1960, and Prince Edward on March 10, 1964.<br/><br/>In February 1952, George VI died in his sleep at age 56 after years of ill health. Elizabeth, on a visit to Kenya, was told that she was now queen.<br/><br/>Her private secretary, Martin Charteris, later recalled finding the new monarch at her desk, “sitting erect, no tears, color up a little, fully accepting her destiny.”<br/><br/>“In a way, I didn’t have an apprenticeship,” Elizabeth reflected in a BBC documentary in 1992 that opened a rare view into her emotions. “My father died much too young, and so it was all a very sudden kind of taking on, and making the best job you can.”<br/><br/>Her coronation took place more than a year later, a grand spectacle at Westminster Abbey viewed by millions through the still-new medium of television.<br/><br/>Prime Minister Winston Churchill’s first reaction to the king’s death was to complain that the new queen was “only a child,” but he was won over within days and eventually became an ardent admirer.<br/><br/>In Britain’s constitutional monarchy, the queen is head of state but has little direct power; in her official actions she does what the government orders. However, she was not without influence. She once reportedly commented that there was nothing she could do legally to block the appointment of a bishop, “but I can always say that I should like more information. That is an indication that the prime minister will not miss.”<br/><br/>The extent of the monarch’s political influence occasionally sparked speculation — but not much criticism while Elizabeth was alive. The views of Charles, who has expressed strong opinions on everything from architecture to the environment, might prove more contentious.<br/><br/>She was obliged to meet weekly with the prime minister, and they generally found her well-informed, inquisitive and up to date. The one possible exception was Margaret Thatcher, with whom her relations were said to be cool, if not frosty, though neither woman ever commented.<br/><br/>The queen’s views in those private meetings became a subject of intense speculation and fertile ground for dramatists like Peter Morgan, author of the play “The Audience” and the hit TV series “The Crown.” Those semi-fictionalized accounts were the product of an era of declining deference and rising celebrity, when the royal family’s troubles became public property.<br/><br/>And there were plenty of troubles within the family, an institution known as “The Firm.” In Elizabeth’s first years on the throne, Princess Margaret provoked a national controversy through her romance with a divorced man.<br/><br/>In what the queen called the “annus horribilis” of 1992, her daughter, Princess Anne, was divorced, Prince Charles and Princess Diana separated, and so did Prince Andrew and his wife, Sarah. That was also the year Windsor Castle, a residence she far preferred to Buckingham Palace, was seriously damaged by fire.<br/><br/>The public split of Charles and Diana — “There were three of us in that marriage,” Diana said of her husband’s relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles — was followed by the shock of Diana’s death in a Paris car crash in 1997. For once, the queen appeared out of step with her people.<br/><br/>Amid unprecedented public mourning, Elizabeth’s failure to make a public show of grief appeared to many to be unfeeling. After several days, she finally made a televised address to the nation.<br/><br/>The dent in her popularity was brief. She was by now a sort of national grandmother, with a stern gaze and a twinkling smile.<br/><br/>Despite being one of the world’s wealthiest people, Elizabeth had a reputation for frugality and common sense. She was known as a monarch who turned off lights in empty rooms, a country woman who didn’t flinch from strangling pheasants.<br/><br/>A newspaper reporter who went undercover to work as a palace footman reinforced that down-to-earth image, capturing pictures of the royal Tupperware on the breakfast table and a rubber duck in the bath.<br/><br/>Her sangfroid was not dented when a young man aimed a pistol at her and fired six blanks as she rode by on a horse in 1981, nor when she discovered a disturbed intruder sitting on her bed in Buckingham Palace in 1982.<br/><br/>The image of the queen as an exemplar of ordinary British decency was satirized by the magazine Private Eye, which called her Brenda. Anti-monarchists dubbed her “Mrs. Windsor.” But the republican cause gained limited traction while the queen was alive.<br/><br/>On her Golden Jubilee in 2002, she said the country could “look back with measured pride on the history of the last 50 years.”<br/><br/>“It has been a pretty remarkable 50 years by any standards,” she said in a speech. “There have been ups and downs, but anyone who can remember what things were like after those six long years of war appreciates what immense changes have been achieved since then.”<br/><br/>A reassuring presence at home, she was also an emblem of Britain abroad — a form of soft power, consistently respected whatever the vagaries of the country’s political leaders on the world stage. It felt only fitting that she attended the opening of the 2012 London Olympics alongside another icon, James Bond. Through some movie magic, she appeared to parachute into the Olympic Stadium.<br/><br/>In 2015, she overtook her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria’s reign of 63 years, seven months and two days to become the longest-serving monarch in British history. She kept working into her 10th decade, though Prince Charles and his elder son, Prince William, increasingly took over the visits, ribbon-cuttings and investitures that form the bulk of royal duties.<br/><br/>The loss of Philip in 2021 was a heavy blow, as she poignantly sat alone at his funeral in the chapel at Windsor Castle because of coronavirus restrictions.<br/><br/>And the family troubles continued. Her son Prince Andrew was entangled in the sordid tale of sex offender businessman Jeffrey Epstein, an American businessman who had been a friend. Andrew denied accusations that he had sex with one of the women who said she was trafficked by Epstein.<br/><br/>The queen’s grandson Prince Harry walked away from Britain and his royal duties after marrying American actress Meghan Markle in 2018. He alleged in an interview that some in the family -– but pointedly not the queen -– had been less than welcoming to his wife.<br/><br/>She enjoyed robust health well into her 90s, although she used a cane in an appearance after Philip’s death. In October 2021, she spent a night in a London hospital for tests after canceling a trip to Northern Ireland.<br/><br/>A few months later, she told guests at a reception “as you can see, I can’t move.” The palace, tight-lipped about details, said the queen was experiencing “episodic mobility issues.”<br/><br/>She held virtual meetings with diplomats and politicians from Windsor Castle, but public appearances grew rarer. The queen withdrew from fixtures of the royal calendar, including Remembrance Sunday and Commonwealth Day ceremonies, though she attended a memorial service last March for Philip at Westminster Abbey.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, she took steps to prepare for the transition to come. In February, the queen announced that she wanted Charles’ wife Camilla to be known as “Queen Consort” when “in the fullness of time” her son became king. It removed a question mark over the role of the woman some blamed for the breakup of Charles’ marriage to Princess Diana in the 1990s.<br/><br/>May brought another symbolic moment, when she asked Charles to stand in for her and read the Queen’s Speech at the State Opening of Parliament, one of the monarch’s most central constitutional duties.<br/><br/>Seven decades after World War II, Elizabeth was again at the center of the national mood amid the uncertainty and loss of COVID-19 — a disease she came through herself in February.<br/><br/>In April 2020 — with the country in lockdown and Prime Minister Boris Johnson hospitalized with the virus — she made a rare video address, urging people to stick together.<br/><br/>She summoned the spirit of World War II, that vital time in her life, and the nation’s, by echoing Vera Lynn’s wartime anthem “We’ll Meet Again.”<br/><br/>“We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return. We will be with our friends again. We will be with our families again. We will meet again,” she said.<br/><br/>___<br/><br/><i>Associated Press writers Gregory Katz and Robert Barr contributed material before their deaths.</i><br/>","Danica Kirka, Jill Lawless and Sylvia Hui | Associated Press",Thu Sep 08 13:47:24 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Article,Former Stoughton police officers accused of 'inappropriate relations' with woman before her death,Former Stoughton police officers accused of 'inappropriate relations' with woman before her death,"Three former Stoughton police officers had “inappropriate relations” with a woman they met through a department-run youth program when she was a teenager, according to <a href=""https://wgbh.brightspotcdn.com/71/72/928f46f84ae9aa1352f175861176/20220923090725392.pdf"" target=""_blank"">a newly released internal affairs report</a>. Investigators also found that one of the officers, Matthew Farwell, ended his relationship with the woman, Sandra Birchmore, shortly before she killed herself in 2021.<br/><br/>The heavily redacted report released on Friday by the Stoughton Police Department capped a 19-month internal investigation, which also hinted at a larger pattern of police misconduct involving female teenagers in the town. Under Massachusetts&#39; law, a person cannot legally consent to sex before they are 16 years old. The report also concluded that the three officers misled investigators looking into Birchmore’s death.<br/><br/>“Through a sustained and deliberate combination of lies, deceit and treachery, [the three officers] violated the policies and the core values of the Stoughton Police Department, not to mention human decency,” Stoughton Police Chief Donna McNamara said during a press conference Friday, in which she outlined the report&#39;s findings.<br/><br/>Birchmore’s connection to the three officers — twins Matthew and William Farwell, and Robert Devine — began when she was 13 years old, as part of a now-defunct Stoughton Police Explorer’s Program. According to McNamara, Matthew Farwell&#39;s relationship with Birchmore turned inappropriate when she was 15 and he was 27. Neither the chief nor the unredacted sections of the report specified the exact nature of their relationship. <br/><br/>In one of the more heavily redacted parts of the report, investigators suggest Birchmore may have been pregnant at the time of her death, when she was 23 years old. It cites an interview with a relative of Birchmore in which she “went on to describe the pressure that Sandra was placing on Matthew Farwell to participate in the baby’s life.”<br/><br/>While the unredacted portions of the report do not include more specifics, <a href=""https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/09/22/metro/three-stoughton-police-officers-had-inappropriate-relationships-with-young-woman-who-came-them-mentoring-town-report-finds/"" target=""_blank"">The Boston Globe reports</a> that Birchmore told friends before she died that she was pregnant with Matthew Farwell’s child.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1663972141860,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1663972141860,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000183-32fa-d47a-a9db-fefa9e6c0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000182-a2af-d717-a3c7-e2bf617e0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000182-3757-d99a-a5ef-f75f95e90001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-6c75-d6d4-afd7-ee752fb70025&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-6c75-d6d4-afd7-ee752ef50000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>Chief McNamara said the investigation found that William Farwell and Devine also had inappropriate relations with Birchmore, including efforts by William Farwell to introduce her to other men, but the report does not indicate whether she was underage at the time of those encounters. McNamara added that Devine, who had been previously demoted from deputy chief to patrol officer for &quot;abuse of power,&quot; had a history of inappropriate conduct with at least one other underage girl connected to the Explorer’s Program. Devine told the Globe he denied the allegations against him.<br/><br/>Matthew Farwell resigned from the department in March. Both William Farwell and Devine resigned in August. <br/><br/>McNamara said she was “heartbroken and incensed” by the conduct of the three former officers. She said she was notifying Massachusetts’ Peace Officer Standards and Training Commission of their findings, and recommending that the Farwell brothers and Devine be permanently barred from serving as police officers in the state. She also said was requesting that POST place the men’s names in a national decertification index, “ensuring they never serve as police officers anywhere.”<br/><br/>McNamara also said the report was given to the Norfolk District Attorney’s Office. In a statement, DA spokesperson David Traub said, “While prosecutors will review any additional information, it should be noted that, in light of Ms. Birchmore’s death at age 23, the investigation to date has not developed a prosecutable statutory rape case against any individual.”<br/><br/>Traub also said both Farwells and Devine had been added to the office’s “Brady list,” which notifies defense lawyers in potential cases of any violations or offenses by police officers that might call their credibility into question in a court case.<br/><br/>The Chair of Stoughton’s Select Board, Debra Roberts, said in an email, that she was “appalled by the findings outlined in the report.”<br/><br/>“This was a critically important investigation,” Roberts added. “The road to rebuilding trust between the community and our police department begins with these findings, and with the decisive action taken by Chief Donna McNamara against the former officers involved. Their leadership will be an essential part of moving the Stoughton Police Department in a positive direction.”",Mark Herz,Fri Sep 23 18:29:12 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,Boston Fed's Collins says 'modest' economic slowdown is possible,Boston Fed's Collins says 'modest' economic slowdown is possible,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Susan Collins, the new president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said Monday that a higher unemployment rate will be needed to bring down inflation <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/inflation-economy-prices-f2270f4c6ac55c084108d57cc1aec53a"">from unusually high levels</a>, but also suggested any economic downturn would likely be modest.<br/><br/>In her first speech as Boston Fed president, Collins said the economy is resilient enough to withstand the higher interest rates needed to combat inflation, which is near a four-decade high. Her comments echoed similar remarks from Raphael Bostic, president of the Atlanta Fed, on Sunday. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has also said that fighting inflation <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/inflation-jackson-wyoming-economy-prices-2158fcfcb5ef0073a4dfb00f791f59bc"">would cause “pain”</a> for households and businesses.<br/><br/>“Accomplishing price stability will require slower employment growth and a somewhat higher unemployment rate,&quot; Collins said in a speech to the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce.<br/><br/>Collins acknowledged that job losses are painful and said “there is apprehension about the possibility of a significant downturn.” Yet she maintained that “the goal of a more modest slowdown, while challenging, is achievable.”<br/><br/>Her comments added to an ongoing debate about how badly the Federal Reserve&#39;s ongoing interest rate increases — the fastest in more than 40 years — will hurt the economy. By lifting its benchmark rate, the Fed is pushing up the <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/rate-hike-personal-impact-4378483e854aa9ae12c55e5a1232de47"">cost of a wide range of consumer and business loans,</a> including for mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1664206347155,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1664206347155,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000183-5f7d-d142-a9cf-7f7d97de0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000183-4760-dc57-a3f3-e771a10a0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000183-45be-d945-a5f7-47be634c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-7a6d-de1d-aba3-7b7f28e5002f&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-7a6d-de1d-aba3-7b7f28090000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>Fed officials hope those increases will achieve a “soft landing&quot; by slowing consumer and business spending enough to bring down inflation but not so much as to cause a recession.<br/><br/>Yet many economists are increasingly skeptical that such an outcome is likely. The Fed has lifted its key rate to a range of 3% to 3.25%, the highest in 14 years, yet job growth remains solid and consumers are still spending at a decent pace. That suggests the Fed may have to push rates higher than expected to slow consumer demand and inflation.<br/><br/>At a policy meeting last week, the Fed lifted its short-term rate by three-quarters of a point for the third straight time.

Article,"First day on the job, Boston's new superintendent talks plans to improve graduation rates","First day on the job, Boston's new superintendent talks plans to improve graduation rates","Boston Superintendent Mary Skipper said improving student graduation rates will be a priority in her new role, kicking off her first official day on the job. <br/><br/>&quot;I see dropouts as the adults failing the students ... myself included,&quot; she said during a press event at the Trotter Elementary School in Boston Monday morning. “Sometimes the student doesn’t see a path forward, and it’s helping the student to understand there is always a path forward.”<br/><br/>During Monday&#39;s press conference, Skipper reiterated that the Boston school system was going “back to basics” after a rocky few months for the state&#39;s largest school district. Skipper was selected on a 4-3 vote by the Boston School Committee in June, following former Brenda Cassellius’ resignation this summer after just three years on the job. Days before the vote, the school district avoided being placed in state receivership when Mayor Michelle Wu and city officials agreed to an urgent improvement plan to fix problems in the district. <br/><br/><a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/education/2022/05/23/new-state-audit-reveals-more-bps-problems"">The state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education has criticized the district</a> for not reporting accurate graduation and dropout rates to the state, also citing chronic student absenteeism as a problem. DESE&#39;s review found a lack of internal controls at the school and central office level.<br/><br/>The city agreed to hire and train more staff to make improvements and create a Data Working Group by Oct. 1 to recommend further improvements in data reporting and tracking.<br/><br/>Skipper said a strong attendance program in the schools will help boost the district graduation rate. <br/><br/>&quot;And then you’re constantly working with the family, working with the students, figuring out what kinds of educational options might be available to that student to help them to get back on track.&quot;<br/><br/>Skipper is the former superintendent of Somerville Public Schools and a former assistant superintendent of high schools in Boston. She has been credited with decreasing dropout rates and increasing graduation rates, and she pledged to do the same now that she has returned to lead the Boston district.<br/><br/>&quot;It’s really knowing every one of your students,&quot; she said. &quot;And that’s the level of accountability that I held myself and my team to [in the past], and it will be the same here in the district.&quot;<br/><br/>She emphasized that the school system’s mission was to nurture “the whole child,” an idea illustrated by the scene at the school shortly before her comments to press, when students and teachers gathered outside for their daily morning affirmations. <br/><br/>“I believe in myself!” the children chanted with gusto and smiles as they echoed a faculty member. “I am responsible! I am successful! I am productive! I am intelligent! I’ve proven myself! I love myself!” <br/><br/>Skipper also mentioned, the recurring problem of late school buses. “You saw the buses, they were here on time,” she said. “We’re not where we wanna be yet, but we’re moving in that direction. And really pleased with a lot of the data so far, particularly correcting a lot of the missed routes that were happening last year.&quot;<br/><br/>She added that, despite the surprise 30-day shutdown of the Orange Line at the beginning of the school year, the district was currently “exceeding last year’s baselines,” and that there had been improvements with the “on time percentage and missed routes.”",Eliza Dewey,Mon Sep 26 15:07:50 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,"Even a small hurricane would pose serious flood risk to Boston-area hospitals, study says","Even a small hurricane would pose serious flood risk to Boston-area hospitals, study says","As officials assess <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2022/09/28/1125601800/hurricane-ian-landfall-florida"" target=""_blank"">the damage Hurricane Ian caused in Florida as a Category 4 storm, </a>researchers at Harvard are warning that even less powerful hurricanes pose a serious flood risk to hospitals in coastal cities, including Boston.<br/><br/>A Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health report released today says nearly a quarter of hospital beds in Boston would be at risk in the event of a Category 2 hurricane. Out of nearly 80 coastal cities included in <a href=""https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022GH000651"" target=""_blank"">the study</a>, Boston was ranked third for most vulnerable to potential impacts, behind the Miami and New York metro areas.<br/><br/>&quot;Our metro area actually has relatively fewer beds available — hospital beds — per population served,&quot; said the study&#39;s senior author Dr. Aaron Bernstein. &quot;And so that means that even though the bite of the hurricane out of the pie of healthcare may be smaller [than other cities], we didn&#39;t have as many beds to start with.&quot;<br/><br/>The study&#39;s authors say their research should serve as a warning to coastal hospitals that they must act now to make their operations more resilient to the growing threat of hurricanes, both by making their infrastructure more resilient to storms and by working together to develop plans for a coordinated response when hurricanes strike.

The last<a href=""https://www.mass.gov/doc/2021-tropical-cyclone-profile/download"" target=""_blank""> storm</a> of that size to hit Massachusetts was <a href=""https://www.mass.gov/service-details/the-worst-massachusetts-hurricanes-of-the-20th-century"" target=""_blank"">Hurricane Bob</a>, in 1991.<br/><br/>The report, which was published in the journal GeoHealth, studied 78 Atlantic and Gulf Coast metro areas. Researchers found that in 25 of those regions, more than half of hospitals would be at risk of flooding from a Category 2 storm.<br/><br/>Even a Category 1 storm would cause flooding at Cape Cod Hospital, Good Samaritan Medical Center, Martha&#39;s Vineyard Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, Mount Auburn Hospital and the Tobey Hospital Campus of Southcoast Hospitals Group, according to the report. In addition to those hospitals, the study&#39;s authors say a Category 2 hurricane would flood Tufts Medical Center and the Cambridge campus of Cambridge Health Alliance.<br/><br/>The study says a Category 2 hurricane would also flood more than 14% of roads within a mile of Boston-area hospitals, making it challenging for people in those areas to access care during a storm.<br/><br/><b>Explore the map to see flood risk based on storm severity at hospitals in Greater Boston, the Cape and Islands.</b><br/><bsp-raw-html html=""&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;\/style&gt;&lt;div class=\&#39;embed-container\&#39;&gt;&lt;iframe src=\&#39;https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/d\/embed?mid=1ojtiyfS_RYW_fWStmG3tGufJbHiTCfY&amp;ehbc=2E312F\&#39; width=\&#39;640\&#39; height=\&#39;480\&#39;&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;"">Raw Html</bsp-raw-html><br/><br/>Bernstein said while strengthening hospital infrastructure against flooding is important, more systemic coordination is needed to prevent storms from turning into crises for hospitals.<br/><br/>&quot;We can&#39;t do resilience by simply focusing on what&#39;s within the four walls of the building,&quot; he said. &quot;We absolutely need coordinated responses that account for whether we&#39;re going to be able to move people and supplies, where there are beds that are the appropriate acuity, where&#39;s the expertise. And beyond that, we should be doing a lot before hurricanes happen, especially for people with chronic medical problems who need regular access to care and where their primary point of access is almost certainly going to be compromised by a hurricane.&quot;<br/><br/>Some Boston-area hospital say they&#39;ve been concerned about this for years, and they continue to reassess their emergency plans.<br/><br/>At Tufts Medical Center, Nick Duncan, the director of operations and emergency management, said they have a plan in place to meet the requirements of the so-called<a href=""https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/MediaLibraries/URMCMedia/flrtc/documents/InsideASHE-Dealing96HourRule.pdf"" target=""_blank""> &quot;96 hour rule&quot;</a> — a standard of the<a href=""https://www.jointcommission.org/"" target=""_blank""> Joint Commission</a>, which does accreditation for hospitals.<br/><br/>&quot;Do we have enough food in the house to make sure we can survive on our own? Do we have enough water — both non-potable for boiling and also for like toilet flushing, but also drinking water for our patients and staff?&quot; Duncan said of the plan. &quot;Do we have enough diesel generator fluid and all those types of things? So that&#39;s kind of ingrained into every emergency manager&#39;s brain when we start thinking about what we need to have on site and what we need to be able to get our fingertips on pretty quickly.&quot;<br/> <br/>Josh Baugh, medical director for the emergency department at Massachusetts General Hospital and medical director for emergency preparedness, said MGH is &quot;well positioned&quot; because people have been thinking about possible storm impacts for years.<br/><br/>&quot;And I would say, emergency preparedness is kind of a continuous process.

And so fortunately, there is collaboration between all the hospitals talking about what are our different plans for this. And if one hospital ran into trouble, it&#39;s a good platform to be able to talk about how do we get patients between them, and what is our overall holistic plan for for the city.&quot;<br/><br/>Baugh noted that Massachusetts is also part of a federally funded partnership called the<b> </b><a href=""https://aspr.hhs.gov/RDHRS/Pages/ma-partnership-rdhrs.aspx"" target=""_blank"">Regional Disaster Health Response System</a>, which connects hospitals across New England for disaster planning.<br/><br/>Baugh said MGH has studied the impacts on hospitals when other cities, like New Orleans and Houston, have been clobbered by hurricanes.

And my hope is that we can trust science here, that we can see these problems coming.&quot;<br/><br/>A lot is already known, he said, about ways to make hospital operations more resilient in hurricanes. And the risk is continuing to grow.<br/><br/>&quot;So I think it behooves us to really get ahead of this,&quot; he said. &quot;And I&#39;m hopeful that our work will help give a little more knowledge that will push us to do a little better to that end.&quot; ",Craig LeMoult,Thu Sep 29 09:37:21 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,4 stories GBH News is following this week,4 stories GBH News is following this week,"<i>GBH news assignment editor Matt Baskin joined GBH </i>All Things Considered <i>host Arun Rath to talk about what stories our newsroom is honing in on this week. This transcript has been lightly edited.</i><br/><br/><b>Arun Rath:<i> </i></b>So let&#39;s start with the Dana Pullman case. We&#39;ve been talking about this in our newscasts. He&#39;s the former head of the [Massachusetts] State Police union and he&#39;s going on trial in federal court this week.<br/><br/><b>Matt Baskin: </b>Yeah, that&#39;s right. Jury selection started today [Monday] in the case. Pullman ran the State Police Association of Massachusetts, better known by the acronym SPAM. Like you said, it&#39;s the union that represents state troopers. Besides running SPAM, Pullman himself was a state trooper. He resigned after <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2019/08/21/former-state-police-union-head-and-lobbyist-arrested-charged-with-misusing-union-funds"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" data-auth=""NotApplicable"" data-safelink=""true"" data-linkindex=""0"" style=""border: 0px; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"">he was arrested three years ago</a>, with the feds claiming he conspired to direct union business to a lobbyist also charged in the case. Her name is Anne Lynch. And Pullman allegedly took money from the troopers union and used it for his own spending — stuff like fancy meals, a trip to Florida, so on and so forth. Prosecutors say he used the union as &quot;his own personal piggy bank.&quot; <br/><br/>Pullman was known for wanting State Police leaders held accountable for misconduct. He went pretty hard after the former head of the State Police, Richard McKeon, who retired quite abruptly five years ago amid claims that he pressured a rank and file state trooper to alter an unflattering report on the arrest of a Massachusetts judge&#39;s daughter.<br/><br/>Now, federal jurors will decide whether Pullman himself is guilty of misconduct. And it&#39;s worth saying that this is the latest scandal adjacent to the State Police or central to the State Police that’s been taken up by the U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts in recent years. Eight state troopers faced federal prosecution for collecting overtime pay for shifts they didn&#39;t actually work, and the last of those eight was sentenced just this past April.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1664895185010,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1664895185010,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000183-8a94-d2e2-ab93-fab59c1e0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000183-7aea-d49b-a7c3-7beaf8650003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000183-66c6-d857-abf7-66ef7c410003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-a37b-d4ba-a9a7-bf7b885f002f&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-a37b-d4ba-a9a7-bf7b87920000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/><b>Rath: </b>And how about on Beacon Hill this week, where we&#39;re between formal legislative sessions right now?

And that&#39;s because under state law, they&#39;re the agency that ultimately is supposed to manage the T. The FDA found that the DPU had been lax in its responsibilities, to say the least.<br/><br/>Lawmakers on Beacon Hill, they already had one oversight hearing about two-and-a-half weeks ago on this. Now they&#39;re having another on Thursday, and one of the things they&#39;ll be talking about is whether the DPU should have oversight when it comes to the T, or whether riders and the state as a whole would be better served without the DPU involved.<br/><br/><b>Rath: </b>So we&#39;ve covered the State House and the State Police. What about Boston City Hall?<br/><br/><b>Baskin: </b>So back in August, Mayor Michelle Wu put out a plan that would give pay raises to city officials, including herself and including city councilors. It would also give bigger salaries to the police commissioner and the fire commissioner. Today [Monday], the City Council is discussing Wu&#39;s plan, which would bring the cap on the mayor&#39;s pay from $207,000 to $230,000. And for councilors, the pay cap would go from about $103,000 to $115,000. And after Monday’s discussion, there could be a City Council vote that&#39;d be coming on Wednesday.<br/><br/>But it is important to note raises for city councilors and for the mayor wouldn&#39;t actually take effect immediately. The heftier paychecks would start going out after the next election cycle. So the people involved in these potential raises, from Mayor Wu who&#39;s proposing them, to the councilors who&#39;ll be voting on them, won&#39;t see any extra money unless they win reelection.<br/><br/><b>Rath: </b>And what else is on the agenda for GBH News this week?<br/><br/><b>Baskin: </b>We&#39;re going to be doing some follow up on a story we&#39;ve been following out of Boston Children&#39;s Hospital the past few weeks. Doctors and other health care workers there who provide gender-affirming care to transgender adolescents have been on the receiving end of some really vile threats from right-wing extremists. One woman from Western Massachusetts actually was charged with calling in a phony bomb threat to the hospital last month. Boston Children&#39;s isn&#39;t the only hospital that&#39;s been facing these kind of threats, and now it looks like some of these health care facilities are actually scrubbing their websites of references to transgender care, ostensibly to make it harder for these extremists to find people to harass. But then that raises some questions about how people needing this care are going to be able to find it if it&#39;s not freely advertised.<br/><br/><b>Rath: </b>Well, Matt, thanks for being with us.<br/><br/><b>Baskin: </b>Thanks a lot. <br/><br/><b>Rath: </b>That&#39;s GBH assignment editor Matt Baskin.

Article,Report finds that women veterans are MIA in Massachusetts ,Report finds that women veterans are MIA in Massachusetts ,"The Massachusetts Department of Veterans&#39; Services defended its outreach to women veterans after a scathing audit showed the department had identified just a tiny fraction of the women veterans in Massachusetts who are eligible for benefits.<br/><br/>“DVS continues to make progress to increase the capacity of its Women Veterans’ Network in fulfilling its mission serving as a resource to support women veterans in Massachusetts through education and outreach,” the department&#39;s communications director Linnea Walsh said in a statement to GBH. <br/><br/>The report by State Auditor Suzanne M. Bump&#39;s office, and released last week, said 1,500 out of 25,000 women veterans — just 6% — were identified by the Department of Veterans&#39; Services between 2019 and 2021.<br/><br/>“We doubt, based on the data and other material provided, that most women veterans are aware of all the resources available to them through DVS,&quot; Bump said in a press release. &quot;This is unacceptable.&quot;<br/><br/>The state noted that unidentified female veterans may be missing out on Chapter 115 financial aid, which can help pay for daily living expenses or medical costs or housing. They&#39;re also eligible for other military benefits, including property tax exemptions, tuition waivers, license plate and ID designations, veteran annuities and care at the soldiers’ homes, according to the audit.

That sort of tournament is the only situation in which bets can be placed in Massachusetts on contests that involve a Massachusetts college or university.<br/><br/>But the commission put a string of caveats on its vote Friday, making clear that the &quot;late January&quot; start of retail betting might have to be reconsidered if the staff working behind the scenes to launch betting runs into &quot;extraordinary circumstances&quot; or if significant issues come up in public comments. And the &quot;early March&quot; start of digital betting may be delayed if the commission gets a large number of applications for the seven mobile licenses it can issue.<br/><br/>&quot;OK, there we go, everyone. Let&#39;s make it a party,&quot; Chairwoman Cathy Judd-Stein said after the commission&#39;s 4-0-1 vote. Commissioner Nakisha Skinner, who made clear that she was uncomfortable with the idea of setting the commission&#39;s timeline based on the sports calendar, abstained.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1665179601697,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1665179601697,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000183-6710-de1d-aba3-677fd3300003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000182-69b2-db35-a3de-fff246b00003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000182-6953-db35-a3de-fff368b40003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-b46f-d14a-a9e3-b5ef6aac0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-b46f-d14a-a9e3-b5ef69cf0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>What the commission ultimately agreed to around 3:30 p.m. Friday mirrored the updated recommendation that Executive Director Karen Wells made at the start of the 12 p.m. meeting.<br/><br/>The debate that filled the hours in between largely boiled down to what risks the commission is willing to accept in a trade-off for speed. For example, the timeline that Wells presented Friday assumed that the commission would support an abridged approach to reviewing third-party vendors. But when that discussion came up later Friday, it led to significant debate among commissioners.<br/><br/>Skinnner said she was not comfortable with the Gaming Commission using a less-detailed process for the sports betting world than it does for the casino gambling sector. Commissioner Eileen O&#39;Brien said she had a lot of the same concerns.<br/><br/>&quot;The risk is the same and so in my mind, we should be applying the same rules across the board on the sports wagering side that we have in place for the gaming vendors,&quot; Skinner said. &quot;If we are going to require them to be licensed in the first place, I don&#39;t see a difference. I don&#39;t see a reason to have a different set of rules.&quot;<br/><br/>O&#39;Brien offered a compromise that was eventually accepted by the other commissioners: to use the abridged process to start, but to build in a sunset clause that would revert to the commission&#39;s more common and more detailed process for reviewing outside vendors on Sept. 1, 2023. That allowed the commission to turn its attention back to its potential timeline.<br/><br/>At one point during Friday&#39;s meeting, Wells and the commissioners dove into a discussion of actual launch dates for in-person betting. Wells first proposed a Jan. 26 start date, but Commissioner Brad Hill said he&#39;d rather Jan. 18 and O&#39;Brien thought the group had mostly settled on two weeks out from the Super Bowl, which would be Jan. 29.<br/><br/>That date, Sunday, Jan. 29, was batted around for a while and struck commission staffers as reasonable since it would not overlap with a busy Friday or Saturday night at the casinos. But then Wells got a text message from an unknown number that raised more concerns: Sunday, Jan. 29 is the date of the AFC and NFC championship games, the contests to decide which teams go to the Super Bowl and betting magnets in their own right.<br/><br/>&quot;If you made it effective on that 12 a.m. on the 29th, that would actually be extremely volatile,&quot; Sterl Carpenter, the commission&#39;s regulatory compliance manager, said referring to the tremendous rush of bettors that would be expected.",Colin A.

Article,Lack of trust may be why some Floridians did not evacuate before Ian,Lack of trust may be why some Floridians did not evacuate before Ian,"Looking at the devastating scenes of destruction in the wake of Hurricane Ian raises the inevitable question: Why didn’t more people get out ahead of the storm? It seems puzzling —especially for those of us not living in the hurricane corridor. But I know firsthand the strong inclination to ignore the official warnings and decide to ride out a storm like Ian is not just typical of Floridians. <br/><br/>Seventeen years ago, like many other longtime residents of Louisiana, my extended family members prepared to hunker down despite the warnings of a direct hit. My widowed father was finally able to coax them north to Memphis. Figuring they’d be away for no more than a couple of days, they arrived with little more than the clothes on their back. Katrina made landfall with winds of 125 mph laying waste to their homes and businesses as it destroyed wide swaths of Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi. Had they stayed, it is likely my relatives would not have made it out alive.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1665181578199,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1665181578199,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000183-838a-d93d-a9df-e3deb3f60000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000183-9d49-d4ba-a9a7-bd59e4300000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000183-86c4-ddf2-a5ab-a6cfe25a0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-b48d-d0d0-adfb-fdadff66000c&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-b48d-d0d0-adfb-fdadfe3d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>Tragically, the numbers of deaths in Florida linked to Hurricane Ian are still rising – 115 and counting. The Fort Myers community of 92,000 residents is in ruins. Survivors of Ian’s 7-foot storm surge and 150 mph winds are now grappling with the pain of losing friends who didn’t make it. Fort Myers Beach Fire Chief Ron Martin told FoxWeather about reading the final Facebook posts of a dear friend who wrote, as the storm worsened, <a href=""https://www.foxweather.com/extreme-weather/missing-fort-myers-hurricane-ian-search-operations"" target=""_blank"">“Hey the water is coming in&quot; and “God am I scared.”</a><br/><br/>Florida residents are accustomed to hurricane seasons that last from June through November and too many of them have weathered predictions of massive storms that failed to materialize. A Fort Myers woman named Halle B. almost died when Ian’s surging water lifted her bed to the ceiling. <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/US/evacuate-hurricane-ian-describe-ride-storm/story?id=90644433"" target=""_blank"">She told ABC Meteorologist Ginger Zee</a> the water receded just as she had only 1 foot of air left to breathe. She regretted not evacuating pointing out she’d been through hurricanes before, “I’m the stupidest woman. I’m from Florida. I went through Andrew, Irma. I decided to stay.” <br/><br/>Halle B. and others who stayed were aware of the possible danger but chose to trust their own instincts more than the official evacuation orders from local leaders. I think it’s part of a larger lack of trust in institutions, a drop Gallup has reported for most of the last 15 years. Last July, a Gallup poll revealed that Americans&#39; trust in major institutions dropped to “an all-time low.” When you don’t know for sure that the institutions you need to rely on are telling the truth, why pay attention? What’s more, as a 2019 report by the Scholars Strategy Network makes clear, &quot;Trust in government becomes more important when citizens face crises” — whether that crisis is the public health pandemic response or hurricane evacuation and recovery. <br/><br/>Abraham Lincoln saw trust as a two-way street, observing, “The people when rightly and fully trusted will return the trust.” Sadly, the same people who didn’t trust the government warnings to leave before Ian made landfall are skeptical about the state and the federal government’s promise to help them recover from the widespread wreckage. I hope they are proven wrong.",Callie Crossley,Mon Oct 10 05:00:55 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maria Whitehammond, chief of environment for the city of Boston. <br/><br/>“This master plan is intended to bridge those gaps and provide a comprehensive framework for changes that build upon what already makes this renowned public space successful, paving the way toward a sustainable and resilient future for Boston Common,” said the city’s Parks Commissioner Ryan Woods. <br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1665602576341,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1665602576341,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;migration.alignment&quot;:&quot;RIGHT&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000183-cda4-d9b5-ab83-cff7951f0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-cda4-d0d0-adfb-dda488a80000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:&quot;/enhancement/EnhancementRight.hbs&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-cda4-d0d0-adfb-dda488880000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">A woman in a long jacket stands behind a podium with news microphones attached to the top.

Article,"In the wake of violence in Roxbury and Dorchester, young people need someone to listen","In the wake of violence in Roxbury and Dorchester, young people need someone to listen","When he got the text, Austin Farmer first felt shock, followed by a rush of overwhelming anger. <br/><br/>It said 14-year-old Rasante “Tay” Osorio — a joyful, goofy, loyal friend he met playing basketball — was dead. He had been shot several times in broad daylight on Washington Street. <br/><br/>“I was just in disbelief,” Farmer said in a recent interview. “I was hurt, I was shocked, and I just felt really angry.” <br/><br/>Osorio’s death this month followed multiple fatal episodes of violence involving children and teens in Roxbury and Dorchester. In two separate incidents at the Jeremiah E. Burke High School, one student was stabbed and another was shot. And the shooting that took Osorio’s life left another child wounded by gunfire.<br/><br/>The crisis has renewed calls for mental health and trauma support to help young people, <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2022/06/30/teens-of-color-in-boston-struggle-to-find-help-in-a-mental-health-crisis"">resources already in short supply even before the pandemic</a>.<br/><br/>“A lot of the people involved in violence have been younger and younger,” said Sheri Bridgeman, a program director at the Center for Teen Empowerment in Roxbury. “A lot of young people’s mental health is suffering, and it’s frustrating.”<br/><br/>Teen Empowerment, located in a low slung brick building across the street from the Roxbury YMCA, hires youth organizers to become “ambassadors for peace” and develop confidence as leaders while they inspire their peers. <br/><br/>The program works with more than 250 young people at a time, even though only 15 candidates will make the final cut to become youth organizers. The process offers much more than just a traditional job interview. The training includes hours of discussion about what’s happening in their lives — and lately, young people are coming in with much to process. <br/><br/>Bridgeman leads candidates through hours of games, brainstorming exercises and discussions designed to get them more comfortable. <br/><br/>“These young people who have either been murdered or hurt, these are their friends and family members,” Bridgeman said. “We can’t hire 263 young people, but we can give them a chance to get their feelings out and get a sense that they can actually do something about it, instead of feeling so hopeless.”<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1666269950825,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1666269950825,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;quote&quot;:&quot;&amp;quot;We can give them a chance to get their feelings out and get a sense that they can actually do something about it, instead of feeling so hopeless.&amp;quot;&quot;,&quot;attribution&quot;:&quot;Sheri Bridgeman, program director at the Center for Teen Empowerment&quot;,&quot;fallbackToPerson&quot;:false,&quot;useGrayBackground&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-f56d-dce5-abdf-fd7d31670014&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000162-022d-dc51-ab7b-96bf02e20008&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-f56d-dce5-abdf-fd7d30790000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/><br/>Farmer’s uncle, Gabriel Petit, drove him to the Teen Empowerment program. He said it’s hard to find a safe place for a young Black man to share their feelings or anger at a senseless death. <br/><br/>“As a Black man, there’s pressure to be masculine and hide your feelings,” he said. “I know that’s wrong, but if you don’t conceal your feelings, if you let out that anger, if you’re Black and you’re mad and you’re crying, the police will get called. You want to escape it, but you can’t.” <br/><br/>Students who gathered at the Teen Empowerment office last Tuesday were led by Bridgeman’s husband, Robert, who kicked off a discussion with a prompt about recent events.

Last year she moved out of the neighborhood where one of the shootings occurred. “It’s just senseless.”<br/><br/>Celeste Buelto, a 21-year-old from Dorchester, said she witnessed violence in high school, and now she’s worried for her nieces and nephews who live in the Grove Hall area.<br/><br/>“It’s heartbreaking to see that this is still happening, and not much has been done to prevent it,” Buelto said. “It makes me feel defeated.”<br/><br/>Buelto’s alma mater, Brighton High School, is a “turnaround” school that was <a href=""https://profiles.doe.mass.edu/accountability/report/school.aspx?linkid=31&amp;orgcode=00350505&amp;orgtypecode=6&amp;"" target=""_blank"">designated as underperforming</a> by the state and <a href=""https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/09/14/neighboring-schools-worlds-apart/ytlIIcdbbO59i2CDK2qWOL/story.html"" target=""_blank"">has struggled to stem violence</a>. <br/><br/>“To hear reports about how the school you graduated from is still so far behind, it’s kind of wounding,” she said. <br/><br/>Bridgeman asked students to act out scenes that showed the impact of issues affecting youth, using theater language to demonstrate parallels in the way conflict can escalate into violence.<br/><br/>“These are the issues that are going on in our communities,” he said, “and these issues create actions in our schools and our neighborhoods. We really need to think about how we move, what we say and who we say it to. Every action is a reaction.”<br/><br/>Farmer, like many of the teens gathered in the center’s conference center, was initially withdrawn and sat hunched in his red Jordans in his seat.<br/><br/>Within a few hours, he was performing a skit about issues affecting young people in his community. Farmer stayed late to talk animatedly with Bridgeman about ways he wants to help his peers “talk about their feelings and anger” and “be more mindful” about finding ways to process it. <br/><br/>Violence was brought up by multiple participants, who highlighted how poverty, racism and a lack of guidance and resources for young people contribute to the problem. Teen Empowerment Executive Director Abrigal Forrester said people too often jump to the wrong conclusions about youth and violence. <br/><br/>“The first mistake people make is to jump to the conclusion that it’s gang activity,” Forrester said, adding that people do not always recognizing the broader cultural forces at work. “We&#39;re living in a culture of death, lifted up through movies and media — this culture that hurting someone else will resolve your pain.&quot;<br/><br/>Law enforcement sources told GBH News that the recent acts of violence are still under investigation, but that none appeared to be gang-related.<br/><br/>For Farmer, becoming a youth organizer is a way to honor the memory of his friend Osorio, who he remembers as someone who was always in high spirits and a “bundle of joy.”<br/><br/>“He was so goofy and he was always clowning on everyone, but whenever you needed something he’d help you out,” he said. “He was just a really good person.”<br/><br/>Talking through his emotions and grief could also be a lifeline. And not just for him. <br/><br/>“I feel like I could actually get my voice out there, like maybe I could actually do something to help,” he said. “A close friend of mine lost his life at a young age. I don’t want that to happen to anyone else.” ",Tori Bedford,Thu Oct 20 05:00:34 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article,Hundreds of educators in Malden and Haverhill on strike,Hundreds of educators in Malden and Haverhill on strike,"Classes were canceled on Monday as dozens of educators picketed outside Malden High School, cheering as passing cars honked in support, and chanting “1, 2, 3, 4, students are who we’re fighting for; 5, 6, 7, 8, a fair contract cannot wait.”<br/><br/>The Malden teachers were among almost 800 on strike in that city, along with about 700 teachers also striking in Haverhill. The educators say their districts need to raise wages to remain competitive with other schools in the region, and that their respective school committees “are showing no interest in addressing needs we see as critical to our students’ success,” according to a statement announcing both strikes on Friday. <br/><br/>The Massachusetts Teachers Association represents educators in both districts, but the contracts are negotiated separately.<br/><br/>Malden Public Schools did not immediately return a request for comment, and Haverhill Public Schools told GBH News Monday morning that a statement might be forthcoming later in the day, after the latest session of contract negotiations wrapped up.<br/><br/>Malden Education Association president Deb Gesualdo said school committee negotiators walked away from the bargaining table on Sunday and declared an impasse. She said the main sticking point was compensation.<br/><br/>“I can tell you that for our paraprofessionals, they don&#39;t make a living wage right now,” Gesualdo said. “They start at about $22,000 [a year] ... and so we are working on crafting a new pay scale for them to bring them closer to a living wage.”<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1666030666150,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1666030666150,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000183-8ebb-d687-afef-deffd5330003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-d22c-d7c0-ab8c-f22db7960002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017f-abeb-d191-a1ff-fbeb95120000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-e727-dce5-abdf-ff37dc6a0008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-e727-dce5-abdf-ff37db920000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>Gesualdo said that salaries for their other professional members — including teachers and assistant principals — were not competitive with other school districts in the area, such as Somerville and Cambridge. She said her district is “hemorrhaging educators&quot; because they cannot attract and retain teachers.<br/><br/>In Haverhill, around 700 teachers are on strike, and some 100 paraprofessionals did not come to work on Monday in support of the strike, according to the MTA.<br/><br/>The MTA says the local unions in several school districts north of Boston meet regularly to discuss their work conditions and that both Haverhill and Malden felt they were facing similar problems.<br/><br/>Both city’s school committees started contract negotiations with educators in May, and salaries are a sticking point in both. In addition, the MTA says staffing levels and increasing the number of teachers of color are issues that remain in Haverhill.<br/><br/>At Malden High School Monday morning, 17-year-old senior Emmalyn Woods was among several students who were on the picket line with their teachers. She was holding a large handmade sign that said &quot;We Love Our Teachers.”<br/><br/>“Me and my friends, we all kind of found out at once last night, and we decided that enough was enough,” Woods said. &quot;We had a student walkout last year when we found out a bunch of teachers had been laid off, so this was kind of the final straw for us when we found out they weren&#39;t even being given a contract.”",Mark Herz,Mon Oct 17 15:33:42 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Article,Sweeps of Mass. and Cass encampments return as Mayor Wu faces pushback,Sweeps of Mass. and Cass encampments return as Mayor Wu faces pushback,"Following a city-sanctioned sweep of a new encampment near the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue and Melnea Cass Boulevard Wednesday morning, Mayor Michelle Wu announced additional efforts to tackle a long-standing crisis of homelessness and drug use in the area, home to several shelters and centers for addiction treatment. <br/><br/>Unlike previous sweeps <u><a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2022/02/28/a-broken-promise-six-weeks-after-city-sweep-of-mass-and-cass-many-still-dont-have-a-place-to-go"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">at Mass. and Cass</a></u>, a team of city employees, public health workers, police officers and members of the Newmarket Business Association worked together to clear 20 tents near the intersection and move people away from Southampton Street to Atkinson Street, in an effort to avoid heavy traffic on the road. <br/><br/>“There has been an ongoing effort every single day to prevent the deeply fortified rows of entrenched encampments from reemerging in the city, while centering the people at the heart of this crisis and the services that are necessary,” Wu said at a press conference Thursday. <br/><br/>At the same time last year, the city counted 90 tents in the area, Wu said, demonstrating a 70% reduction in encampments. The number of individuals without housing in the area is now 173, down from 262 at this time last year, according to Wu. <br/><br/>“The number of individuals gathering in the area has gone down, although it is still a large number,” she said. “The number of tents that are there have gone down, although we still see them popping up every day and work to take them down every day.”<br/><br/>This progress, Wu said, demonstrates the effectiveness of ongoing efforts in the area that <u><a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2022/01/12/nothing-is-different-people-struggle-to-find-housing-after-city-clears-tents-at-mass-and-cass"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">began in earnest after a sweep of hundreds of tents last January</a></u>. Through a needle exchange program with the group Access, Harm Reduction, Overdose Prevention and Education (AHOPE), the city has collected nearly three times the amount of syringes it has given out since January, according to Bisola Ojikutu, executive director of the Boston Public Health Commission. <br/><br/>“HIV, viral hepatitis and other bloodborne pathogens pose a serious threat to the health and safety of people who use drugs, as well as others,” Ojikotu said. “If not addressed, these infections could create a larger public health crisis than the one we&#39;re dealing with currently.

We must mitigate the public health risks to families, young people and residents of all ages who deserve parks, playgrounds, streets and sidewalks that are safe and clean in every part of Boston.” <br/><br/>Before Wu could go into detail, one protester yelled out, “What about the kids at recess who can’t play outside?” Others began chanting “shame on Wu!” while holding signs that read “Wu doesn’t care.” <br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1666303929783,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1666303929783,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-f90b-d5dc-a1e2-fd1fd10c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;Related Stories:&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000182-1ecd-d6aa-a7a3-5fddb8e40003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-dbe5-dd5c-ad7f-fbed56100003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-868c-dfd5-adbf-9eae3d150003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-f15f-d49d-af7e-fbdf6e040003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-f773-d508-a3bb-f7ffa3d10027&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-f773-d508-a3bb-f7ffa0da0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>Protesters were joined by City Councilors Erin Murphy and Frank Baker, who recently renewed <u><a href=""https://www.boston.gov/sites/default/files/file/2022/10/1032.pdf"" target=""_blank"">their call for a hearing</a></u> about what can be done to increase safety at Clifford Park. <br/><br/>After being shouted down at the park, Wu continued the news conference from a private room at the Parks Department Headquarters, joined by a number of city leaders and Newmarket Business Association president Sue Sullivan, who has fielded concerns from residents and business owners in the area for years. <br/><br/>“If you talk to businesses down here, if you talk to residents, a lot of people will tell you that it&#39;s still bad, and things are bad, we’ve still got people on the street, and they’re not wrong,” Sullivan said. “But they are wrong if anybody says that there&#39;s not progress being made.

And I just froze and I went, ‘OK, if that&#39;s not a ghost, I don&#39;t have another word for what it is that I saw,’” he said.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1666381909871,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1666381909871,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000183-fa09-d0cf-a3a7-fafd2c470003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-c89a-d7e8-a1ff-ccdb34f40003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-fc19-d0cf-a3a7-fefd949f0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-fc19-d0cf-a3a7-fefd93760000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>Despite the sheer number of ghost stories he encounters, Belanger said he has only a few personal experiences as visceral as that day in Paris. He thinks the appeal of ghost stories is directly tied to how varied those reports of paranormal experiences are — from visions to smells to unexplained sensations.<br/><br/>“There&#39;s Abe Lincoln, tipping his hat, saying &#39;four score,&#39; and then there&#39;s, you know, smelling grandma&#39;s perfume weeks after she died,&quot; he explained. &quot;There&#39;s a whole spectrum in there. There&#39;s having a dream that feels like it&#39;s more than a dream, or that — just that feeling you get that someone&#39;s nearby and you look around and no one&#39;s there.”<br/><br/>Ultimately, it’s our ability to empathize, he says, that really allows us to understand and relate to ghost stories. <br/><br/>“We&#39;re human beings, we have empathy, we tune into things,&quot; Belanger said. &quot;I&#39;ve been in haunted places all over the world. And when I walk into an old abandoned prison, where people were murdered, killed, shvived, executed and so on, I imagine what it must have felt like to be brought into a place like that and know this is home for the next five years, ten years, whatever.”<br/><br/>Belanger doesn’t think that empathy needs to translate into belief in the paranormal to make the stories worthwhile for a listener, however. He said ghost stories have value beyond their sensationalism or entertainment factor. <br/><br/>“When we talk about ghosts and haunted places, we get to have this profound discussion without getting into all the dogmas of religion, and my belief system says this and yours says that,&quot; he said. &quot;Be a skeptic and just enjoy the story. There&#39;s still some inherent value in it.”<br/><br/><i>Belanger will be hosting a virtual event, “Ghosts and Legends with Jeff Belanger” with GBH on Monday night. <a href=""https://wgbh2.force.com/events/s/lt-event?id=a7E3q000000MJBlEAO"" target=""_blank"">You can buy tickets here</a>.</i>",Gia Orsino,Fri Oct 21 15:58:41 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Article,"Coyote population isn't growing in Mass., they're just more visible","Coyote population isn't growing in Mass., they're just more visible","<i>Wildlife encounters are pretty common in the Greater Boston area, from wild turkeys at crosswalks to coyotes in yards. Well-publicized coyote attacks in recent years and an uptick in sightings this year have some people worried. Wildlife biologist Susan McCarthy from the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife joined GBH </i>All Things Considered<i> host Arun Rath to help us understand coyote activity in the area. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.</i><br/><br/><b>Arun Rath: </b>So first, could you start off by giving us maybe a bit of a coyote reality check? Are we seeing significantly more sightings in encounters than in the past? And does that mean there are more coyotes on the ground in Eastern Massachusetts? <br/><br/><b>Susan McCarthy: </b>Well, what I can say is that it does seem as though there are more reports of coyotes in suburban and urban environments. But whether or not that means there are more coyotes on the landscape is a great question to ask. And so what we&#39;ve determined is that over the past 10 years, the coyote population in Massachusetts has stabilized. Coyotes are existing at very high densities and they&#39;re in all available habitats throughout the commonwealth of Massachusetts. We wouldn&#39;t say that the coyote population is growing. ... We know that&#39;s not true. That&#39;s not the case. <br/><br/>But what we do know is that coyotes are utilizing suburban and even urban environments very heavily, very commonly. And in doing so, they have lots of day-to-day interactions with people. And people, of course, nowadays always have a phone at the ready to take pictures and videos and document their experiences, and share those experiences regularly. <br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1666647584148,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1666647584148,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-94bc-d208-a97c-dfff23d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000182-40c6-dab7-a3bf-6edfaf4a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-b9bb-d4bf-abc3-bfbfc46c0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000016b-6c54-d757-adef-fd7d79be0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-0bee-d28d-a9f6-6fefff4e0019&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-0bee-d28d-a9f6-6feffe740000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/><b>Rath: </b>So then I guess the next reality check is help us then balance those reports with the real risk assessment here, because there are some scary stories. You know, it was just down the road from me here in Arlington last year where we had a couple of toddlers that were attacked by a coyote. How much of a threat, though, are coyotes to humans and our pets in reality? <br/><br/><b>McCarthy: </b>So I do like to preface all of these conversations with letting people know that coyotes, generally speaking, they&#39;re not posing any kind of a real threat to human health and safety the vast majority of the time. But you&#39;re correct, there are instances that have occurred where coyotes are, arguably, a public safety risk. <br/><br/>The reality is that coyotes, while they&#39;re not usually a threat to people, they are unquestionably a threat to our domestic pets, particularly when we leave our pets unsupervised outdoors. So when it comes to pet ownership, we&#39;re constantly reminding folks, if you have a cat, please keep that cat indoors [because] that&#39;s where it&#39;s going to be safest. As far as dogs go, please ensure that your dog is always leashed and under close supervision, under good voice command, and know that if you do take your dog off leash — especially taking them for hikes — you do run the risk of your dog interacting with wild animals, not just coyotes, but other wild animals as well. <br/><br/>As far as threats to human health and safety, again, those are very few and far between, but we have had instances. And over the past five years or so, there&#39;s been an uptick in these instances. And what we&#39;ve seen is that the vast majority of time when these when coyotes are having these negative interactions with people, we see that there&#39;s a link to artificial or intentional feeding. So we see that there&#39;s certainly a connection between problematic behavior in coyotes and their access to human-associated food sources. <br/><br/>I understand that folks are very hesitant to use harassment techniques, but it is a really important message to send to folks not only that we want to be removing food attractants that bring these animals into our backyards, but when we do see these animals that we&#39;re actively and aggressively harassing them. And the reason for that is because it&#39;s essentially using your body language to communicate to that animal that you&#39;re the dominant individual, that this is your territory. So you&#39;re teaching that animal, using negative conditioning, that when you come into my territory — my home — something frightening is going to happen to you that could threaten your life. <br/><br/><b>Rath: </b>Does the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife actively manage the coyote population? Or, you know, how how how do you approach that? <br/><br/><b>McCarthy: </b>So that&#39;s a great question. And oftentimes we hear from folks that that are looking to us to actively manage the coyote population. And the reality is, is that it takes very high levels of lethal removal in order to actually manage — and when we&#39;re talking about managing [that means] reducing coyote populations. So we know from the scientific literature that it would take a removal of 70% or more of a coyote population year after year in order to see a decrease in the number of coyotes on the landscape, and we know that that&#39;s just not feasible. <br/><br/>So to answer your question, do we manage coyotes? Perhaps not in the sense that that you&#39;re implying that we&#39;re actively reducing coyote populations. That&#39;s not something that&#39;s really an option on the table. We know from examples from a number of other states that in our U.S. history that coyotes have been persecuted for a very long time. We know that these animals have been actively poisoned. There have been bounties on these animals. There have been open, very liberal, year-round hunting seasons. And none of those things have ever resulted in the reduction of coyote populations. <br/><br/>So what I can say is that coyotes are here in the United States. They&#39;re here in the Northeast, in Massachusetts. They&#39;re here to stay. The population isn&#39;t going to be decreasing. And there really isn&#39;t anything that can be done to decrease coyote populations. ","Diego Lopez, Arun Rath",Mon Oct 24 17:40:43 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And I think it&#39;ll have a pretty great impact in terms of housing affordability in our city.”<br/><br/>Azeem said dropping the requirement for off-street parking makes sense in a city where one-third of residents don’t own cars. He said that, in some neighborhoods, there’s even less demand for parking, such as Central Square, where two-thirds of people are without cars.<br/><br/>Aligning parking construction more carefully with parking demand could be a boon to local developers, he said.<br/><br/>“In some of our new buildings in Kendall Square, you have eight stories of underground parking for almost $100 million,” he said “And then once the building is built, you do the analysis and almost half of that parking isn&#39;t going to use — so that&#39;s almost, you know, $40 [million], $50 million that went to waste.”<br/><br/>Tamara Small, the CEO of the Massachusetts branch of NAIOP, the Commercial Real Estate Development Association, said her group’s members welcomed the zoning change in Cambridge.<br/><br/>“This is a decision we think is in the right direction,” Small said. “It does reduce costs, and it does put us in line with other cities throughout the country that have adopted these same policies, including Minneapolis, San Francisco and Nashville.”<br/><br/>Small added that more flexibility for developers comes at a good time, with construction costs skyrocketing and interest rates increasing in recent months.<br/><br/>“So the cost to build is going up and up and up,” said Small. “So anything that reduces the cost to build while allowing for that flexibility will ensure that projects can move forward — something I think is absolutely critical for economic development in this region right now.”<br/><br/>Azeem said one way getting rid of minimum parking requirements could increase affordability in the city is by opening up previously restricted lots.<br/><br/>“There’s a lot of small pieces of land in Cambridge where you can&#39;t have a house and a parking lot. You can’t fit both, and so you get neither,” Azeem said. “And so now you can at least build a house in those places.”<br/><br/>More renovations to smaller properties would now be possible as well. In the past, he said, some existing homes would have had to be brought up to code before being renovated, but were blocked by lack of space for off-street parking. <br/><br/>Doug Quattrochi, the executive director of MassLandords, a statewide trade group, said he still sees a demand for parking in rentals that already have it, so the change will take while to fully have an effect. <br/><br/>Still, Quattrochi said, changing the parking requirement makes sense given the city’s good access to public transportation and many protected bike lanes. Long-term changes to the city’s landscape could better serve all its residents, he added.<br/><br/>“The cars always find a space, but we&#39;ve got lots of people who really need housing and we don&#39;t have that,” he said. “So I think this is really going to help.”",Mark Herz,Tue Oct 25 14:08:58 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The state constitution allows the governor to grant pardons, which are initially reviewed by an advisory board. The board recommended the pardons, according to a state press release, and they now must be approved by eight-member elected Governor’s Council. <br/><br/>“Each of these individuals has shown compelling reasons for requesting a pardon, including the need to remove barriers that currently prevent them from accessing more professional opportunities,&quot; Baker said in a press statement. &quot;These offenses all occurred many years ago, and since that time, all four individuals have committed themselves to bettering their lives and improving their communities.”<br/><br/>The four include <a href=""https://www.mass.gov/doc/zaida-mirita-pimentel-solano-report-and-recommendation/download"">Zaida imentel-Solano,</a> who was convicted in 1996 on drug-distribution charges and received a one year suspended sentence, state records show. Since then, she has not been charged with any other offenses.

Her daughter, Leila, is currently a first-year student at Harvard. While she agreed to recuse herself from the Harvard case in her Senate confirmation hearing last spring at the request of U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (also a Harvard Law School alum) legal experts said the loss of her voice as the first Black woman in the nation&#39;s top court strikes a blow to racial equity.<br/><br/>A Harvard pedigree is hardly unusual in the nation&#39;s top court and it has not often been a reason for a recusal.

He said Harvard&#39;s Board of Overseers doesn&#39;t have a “definitive say” over the admissions process at the college, but it does &quot;purport to advise the university on admissions policies.&quot;<br/><br/>“To me, there was a very clear and necessary basis to recuse from the Harvard case,&quot; he said.<br/><br/>Turley, who has been publicly criticized as a Republican mouthpiece who defended Trump against impeachment, disagreed that Thomas should have stepped down from the insurrection cases. He argued that Thomas&#39; wife, Ginni Thomas, is a well-known conservative activist in Washington, D.C., and as the spouse of a justice, she is allowed to have a professional existence and identity separate from her husband&#39;s. Her role in the case came into question when her emails to lawyer John Eastman became public. Eastman played a key role in efforts to pressure former Vice President Mike Pence to block the certification of Joe Biden’s presidential victory.<br/><br/>“The views that she was expressing in these emails and communications were consistent with what she has said publicly,&quot; Turley said. &quot;One can certainly disagree with those views. But the idea that a justice has to recuse himself because of that context, I&#39;m not convinced.”<br/><br/>Both Feingold and Turley agreed Jackson&#39;s recusal may not have major implications, considering the Supreme Court&#39;s conservative supermajority.<br/><br/>Williams said it&#39;s a loss of perspective that could be felt for generations if the court&#39;s conservative majority votes as many expect they will.<br/><br/>“One point that was often made in the commentary after Justice Jackson was nominated and ultimately confirmed after the confirmation process was that her perspective as a former public defender would be an important one to have on the Supreme Court,” Williams said. <br/><br/>Last spring, Jackson&#39;s recusal was widely seen as a blow to Harvard because it would leave only two justices — Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor — likely to rule in favor of the university and allow a 6-3 conservative majority to possibly overturn current affirmative action policies.<br/><br/>But Jackson&#39;s opinions will not be entirely unknown.<br/><br/>The Supreme Court separated a similiar discrimination case to Harvard&#39;s that was filed against University of North Carolina. Jackson will be able to hear arguments and vote in the UNC case.<br/><bsp.separator>Separator</bsp.separator><br/><br/><i>Clarification: This story was updated to note that George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley has been criticized for his support of former President Donald Trump.</i>",Diane Adame,Mon Oct 31 15:15:03 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Items that don&#39;t sell are marked down by half in their last week in the store, then moved to an even more discounted &quot;outlet store&quot; on the site.<br/><br/>Anything that&#39;s not sold after that store-to-outlet journey, or that didn&#39;t make the cut in the first place, is machine baled and sold to a textile recycling company in Nova Scotia called Acadian Wipers. Anything that company can&#39;t sell in its thrift stores is cut into industrial cleaning rags or exported to Central America, South America or Africa.<br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1667239993963,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-e4be-dadb-a77e-f5be3b2c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1667239993963,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000162-e4be-dadb-a77e-f5be3b2c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000184-2f3d-d7be-ada5-affdf6870001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2f3d-d335-a7ce-bf3fe6fa0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2f3d-d335-a7ce-bf3fe6d10000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">Goodwill bales</bsp-image><br/>That&#39;s similar to how Helpsy handles the clothes it collects. Helpsy Chief Executive Officer Dan Green said the company offers pickup operations like the one in Boston, operates collection bins in 16 states, and purchases unsold thrift store items. That has helped Helpsy collect nearly 100,000 pounds of clothing a day.<br/><br/>Some of those clothes are then sold to people who try to make money reselling the items through online marketplaces like Poshmark.<br/><br/>Other items that are no longer marketable for resale as clothes are sold for wiper rags or as &quot;shoddy,&quot; Green said, which he described as &quot;mechanical fiber-to-fiber recycling&quot; that essentially breaks down a piece of cloth into threads that can be used for other products.<br/><br/>Finally, Helpsy will export clothes if they can still be worn but are unlikely to sell in the United States.<br/><br/>Not everyone wants those exports.

And that&#39;s a really positive trend.&quot;<br/><br/>While many textile collection bins prominently feature the logos of charities, it&#39;s not always clear how much of the value of those donations goes to a particular cause.

Article,Salem takes in record numbers of Halloween tourists,Salem takes in record numbers of Halloween tourists,"Saying that Halloween in Salem is “a big deal” is like saying the U.S. presidental elections are “extremely important.” It’s an obvious fact, and its mere acknowledgement feels like redundancy. But that doesn’t make it any less true. <br/><br/>Still, in 2022, the holiday might be even a bigger deal for the Massachusetts city of 45,000: the month of October has brought crowds in numbers destined for the record books. Salem has thrived on its image as Witch City <a href=""https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2022/10/21/salem-is-the-halloween-capital-of-america-but-it-wasnt-always-that-way"">for the better part of the last half century,</a> and the October tourists are vital to its local economy. Even with a Monday-night Hallow’s Eve this year, a typically slow weeknight could bring in floods of eager visitors. <br/><br/>Tourism numbers for the entire month of October, including those for Halloween itself, won&#39;t be available until a few days into November. But according to Destination Salem Executive Director Kate Fox, through the 28th — just before Halloween weekend — visitor numbers are up 7% from 2021, and 19% from the pre-COVID 2019.<br/><br/>Even in 2020, when much of the world’s activity ground to a halt during the first tubulent months of the pandemic, visitors still showed up — <a href=""https://patch.com/massachusetts/salem/salems-stay-away-halloween-message-gains-national-attention"" target=""_blank"">despite appeals from Mayor Kim Driscoll and ad campaigns</a> urging tourists to remain home in the interest of public health.<br/><bsp-module data-state=""{&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1667241588698,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000179-234a-d2db-af7b-774a0c6f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1667241588698,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000179-234a-d2db-af7b-774a0c6f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;module&quot;:{&quot;relatedPostsHeader&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;relatedPostItems&quot;:[{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000183-fa09-d0cf-a3a7-fafd2c470003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000184-0fb2-d0cf-a3a5-fff7de5c0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;},{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000184-2056-d76a-a1cd-27ff4bee0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef729f20000&quot;}],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2f3f-d7be-ada5-afff00430000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016d-b178-dd16-a77f-f37adb5c0000&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2f3e-d7be-ada5-affeff350000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a100000&quot;}"">Module</bsp-module><br/>“Salem tried to plead with visitors not to come in order to not spread COVID,” recalled Greg Coles, a Salem dance instructor and musician. “But there was traffic nonetheless.”<br/><br/>That traffic has only grown, whether it be in the form of queued automobiles inching west on Norman Street, a clogged detour to the pedestrian-friendly closed streets; or heavily packed commuter rail cars, chugging up through Chelsea and Swampscott and picking up scores of reveling Top Gun combat pilots, nurses, comic-book heroes and Victorian-era nobility.<br/><br/>And while there are undoubtedly Salem residents annoyed by the crush of tourists every year (“I want traffic to be less than what it is right now — enjoy your life back in Missouri, Montana, wherever the heck you&#39;re from,” admonished one frustrated partier waiting to enter a bar), a great deal of locals welcomed the diverse Halloween observants over the holiday weekend. <br/><br/>“Out here, you’ll see about 100 people getting off of a tour bus every 30 minutes,” said Jason Rodriguez, who moved to Salem from East Boston seven years ago. “It makes me happy. I love meeting people from Minnesota, Iowa, Idaho, New Mexico, Texas. It’s all types of backgrounds and cool ethnicities.”<br/><br/>Though the crowds have returned in record numbers, some businesses are still on the slow road to a more deliberate recovery. Coles’ partner Carrie Francis Cabot, for instance, has a tradition of teaching Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” dance to students so they can perform it in the annual parade. But it was different this year. <br/><br/>“We’ve just kind of been bouncing back after COVID,” Coles said. “The effect of the season, however, has been to kind of slow things down, because people are a little hesitant to come into Salem. My private lessons aren&#39;t really affected, but group classes — we had to make them earlier to beat the traffic.” <br/><bsp-image data-state=""{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000160-2ca4-dda9-abf8-ffb4eba00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4c0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1667246057315,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1667246057315,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-0b04-d00a-ad7f-abf4ec010000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a4e0001&quot;},&quot;migration.alignment&quot;:&quot;RIGHT&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000184-2f4f-d6e2-abfd-6f6fdafa0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a090000&quot;},&quot;captionOverride&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hideCaption&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2f4f-d6e2-abfd-6f6f0a800000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0003&quot;},&quot;theme.default.:core:figure:Figure.hbs._template&quot;:null,&quot;theme.default.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template&quot;:&quot;/enhancement/EnhancementRight.hbs&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2f4f-d6e2-abfd-6f6f0a640000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-fed7-db18-a37f-fef72a0a0001&quot;}"">Cars lined up, on the street, in the night.</bsp-image><br/><br/>Halloween 2022 is bringing with it another air of unpredictability: the holiday proper falls on a Monday. <br/><br/>“Welcoming huge crowds? 100%,” said Olivia, a tour guide at Black Cat Tours, which takes guests through Salem’s haunted history. “We’re used to that and we love it. We’ll accommodate as many people as we can within the city guidelines — but the infrastructure and the traffic of that many cars coming in is almost to the point of being nonsensical.” <br/><br/>As a work and school night for many, some workers are having a difficult time gauging how that will factor into the truth of the enormity of the crowds. <br/><br/>“Unfortunately, this year is very tough to gauge,” said C.T. Hannon, who works security for Black Cat Tours. “We&#39;ve obviously already had record-breaking numbers all season. Normally, a Monday night Halloween would be a slower evening, but looking at the numbers, I have no idea what to expect.” ",James Bennett II,Mon Oct 31 16:32:14 EDT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
