        "body": "MIT materials researcher Yoel Fink said he had never seen anything like it in his nearly 30 years as a scientist at one of the world's premiere engineering universities.In a small MIT conference room with the blackout shades pulled down, FBI agents told him and other researchers in the fall that rogue nations like China, Russia and India were sending secret agents to steal intellectual property from university labs and asked them to take steps to stop it, including vetting their staff.\u201cI've never had a formal threat briefing by law enforcement here,\u201d Fink said, saying the experience left him shaken. \u201cLaw enforcement should come onto campus only when there is clear evidence of a crime.\u201dCampus administrators at MIT are following new national security guidelines first announced under Trump and enacted by the Biden administration that are supposed to protect research labs from spying and international espionage. At MIT, that has meant not only on-campus briefings by the FBI, but a new requirement asking professors who receive federal funding to sign a disclosure form certifying that their students are not participating in suspicious activities. And while many MIT faculty aren\u2019t happy about it, experts say it's a sign of what\u2019s to come at other U.S. research universities.\u201cIt will absolutely be coming to you soon \u2014 if it's not there already,\u201d said Kristin West, director of the Research Ethics and Compliance Committee at the Council on Governmental Relations, an association representing more than 200 top research institutions.Authorities have previously estimated intellectual property theft costs the U.S. $200 billion a year. But the steps have raised criticism that the government is going too far and will alienate talented researchers or discourage them from working in the U.S. West said concerns about xenophobia and the loss of global talent are legitimate.\u201cI think you have to be afraid that somebody's going to throw the baby out with the bath water, because professors are just going to say, \u2018This is too much trouble \u2013 puts me at too much risk. I'm just not going to bother with international collaborations anymore,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that hurts science.\u201d Fears of law enforcement overreach are front of mind at MIT following the case of mechanical engineering professor Gang Chen, a naturalized U.S. citizen who was accused under the Trump administration of concealing his affiliation with the Chinese government in applications for grants he received from the U.S. Energy Department. The Justice Department abandoned the case, a high-profile one, when federal prosecutors said they could no longer meet the burden of proof at trial. Fink, the materials scientist, described Chen as \u201ca brother,\u201d saying the two men grew close following Chen\u2019s arrest. Four months after the Justice Department dropped Chen\u2019s case, about 60 researchers were briefed by the FBI about ongoing threats from foreign spies working in their labs in a power point presentation. Fink said the upshot was this: \u201cYou need to know that there may very well be spies on campus, and you need to try to find them.\u201dMIT would not confirm the FBI\u2019s meetings on its campus. A spokesperson said only that there are \u201coccasional exchanges between researchers and various federal agencies on topics of mutual interest, which sometimes involve discussions regarding research security.\u201dBut in the months following the briefings, MIT began asking researchers who receive funding from the Department of Energy to sign a document that asks them to make \u201creasonable inquiry\u201d with researchers to determine if they are participating in any recruitment programs involving China, Russia, North Korea, or Iran specifically.MIT said the form is a required part of federal guidelines, and that it has a history of advocating for ways to balance sensitive research security concerns with the need to offer a welcoming research environment.Under the CHIPS & Science Act signed into law by President Joe Biden in August, research universities that receive any federal funding will be required to certify that none of their researchers or students are participating in \u201ca malign foreign talent recruitment program\u201d starting next summer.U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm broadly defended the measure on a recent trip to Massachusetts. She said, \u201cthe whole genesis of this is to make sure that American taxpayer dollars fund American research and researchers.\u201dGranholm said the focus is not on brilliant foreign researchers from around the world \u2014 or with the Chinese diaspora, like Gang Chen.\u201cOur grievance is with the Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party and making sure that America can remain competitive and can be a leader,\u201d she said.And that has left some research experts wondering whether the new measures are misdirected.\u201cWe remain extremely concerned about the chilling impact on researchers, but also on our international students,\u201d said Sarah Spreitzer of the American Council on Education, an association representing 1,700 colleges and universities. \u201cI think an international student trying to decide whether or not to come to study in the United States may look at some of these things and think, \u2018You know, maybe I should just switch and study in Canada or in the UK, so it is a big concern,\u201d Spreitzer said.MIT professors agree, and said the changes made them uneasy, and even fearful or paranoid around students and colleagues.Keith Nelson, who has taught physical chemistry at MIT for four decades, said suggesting professors investigate the backgrounds of their graduate students and postdocs is wholly unreasonable. He\u2019s advising his younger colleagues not to sign. \u201cAs soon as I\u2019m the one who has to sit down with my student from China and ask those questions, it can\u2019t help but somehow poison the relationship,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cAfterall, I\u2019m not asking that of my American citizen students.\u201dGabriela Schlau-Cohen, who teaches physical chemistry at MIT, said she was surprised when she was asked to sign the disclosure statement.After consulting with an attorney to better understand the document\u2019s jargon, she said she has refused to sign it unless the university changes some of its language or allows her to make edits.\u201cI\u2019m not trained to do \u2018reasonable inquiry,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cMy goal is to educate my students, not to interrogate them.\u201dIt\u2019s still unclear what the repercussions are for professors who refuse to sign the new affirmation form. Asked if they would lose their funding, a spokesperson for MIT only said that administrators are not aware of any researchers refusing to sign.Inside his lab in the basement below MIT\u2019s iconic Great Dome, Fink, the materials scientist, equated the reaction to potential espionage to some key findings in his research exploring whether fabrics can monitor health risks in real-time. When the human body detects a small danger, he said, its reaction is sometimes worse than the threat itself.GBH News reporter Mark Herz contributed to this report.",

        "body": "Nearly two years after its executive director was hired, and roughly one year after it began to operate in earnest, Boston\u2019s Office of Police Accountability and Transparency has yet to sustain any civilian complaints against the Boston Police Department or to issue subsequent recommendations for disciplinary action, according to a review of city data by GBH News. A data dashboard on the office\u2019s website says that in 2022 OPAT, as the office is widely known, received 56 complaints from civilians about the BPD, which employs more than 2,000 officers, and that 21 of those complaints were deemed lacking. But according to a city spokesperson, that doesn\u2019t include more than two dozen complaints that were quickly dismissed upon initial review rather than being sent to OPAT\u2019s Civilian Review Board for deeper consideration. When those are included, the spokesperson said, the tally of complaints received in 2022 rises to 89.Thirty-five complaints are still pending. The Boston Police Department, which maintains an alternate mechanism through which civilians can file complaints for review by the BPD, told GBH News it received 126 citizen complaints in 2022 and has sustained two of them. As a matter of policy, OPAT does not investigate cases that are already being pursued by the BPD. The abundance of dismissals and lack of sustained complaints are striking \u2014 especially given the high hopes that accompanied Boston\u2019s police-reform push in 2020, after George Floyd\u2019s murder by a Minneapolis police officer spurred outrage and calls for change nationwide. In interviews, OPAT head Stephanie Everett and experts in civilian oversight suggest why that might be the case. Everett, who was appointed as OPAT\u2019s executive director in April 2021 by then-acting Mayor Kim Janey, told GBH News that the members of the Civilian Review Board have only been seated for about a year, and have spent some of that time being trained for their new role. Everett also said more work needs to be done to remind Bostonians that OPAT exists, and pointed out that the office is currently holding a series of community listening sessions aimed at raising its public profile.\u201cThere are still far too many people who don't know that there is a third party that exists for them, in Nubian Square, that they can come into and file a complaint,\u201d Everett said. \u201cThey can call, they can email, they can show up to file a complaint and to just have a conversation about an interaction that they had with the Boston police that they have questions about. And we need to do a better job, in my office, of making sure that they know that we exist.\u201d For some Bostonians, Everett added, simply being informed or reminded of OPAT\u2019s existence may not be enough.\u201cWhile we are not a monolith ... a lot of Black and brown people still don\u2019t trust government, and we are a governmental agency,\u201d she said. \u201cI started this job understanding that trust is going to have to be the foundation, but it\u2019s also a very hard ask. They don\u2019t know who I am. They don\u2019t know who this agency is. ... We\u2019re asking a lot of them to come and trust that, if they file a complaint with us, that it will be fair and thoroughly investigated.\u201d OPAT, which was created by a 2020 city ordinance, is a complex entity charged with reviewing existing and proposed BPD policies, sharing Boston policing data with the public, and monitoring the BPD\u2019s ongoing reform efforts.OPAT also includes and supports the work of the Civilian Review Board, as well as the Internal Affairs Oversight Panel, which subjects the findings of internal BPD investigations to outside review. Another part of OPAT, the three-member OPAT Commission, acts as a de facto board of directors and has the power to issue subpoenas. However, the city spokesperson said cooperation from the BPD has made that unnecessary so far.Under the ordinance that created OPAT, the Civilian Review Board is supposed to make disciplinary recommendations if complaints against BPD employees is upheld, though the Boston police commissioner is not obligated to follow them.In an annual report sent to the mayor in August 2022, Everett said that some civilian allegations of officer misconduct have lacked crucial information, and that some complainants have subsequently cut off contact with OPAT altogether. In that same report, Everett said OPAT\u2019s work had been complicated by a regulatory change made by the Massachusetts Peace Officer Standards and Training Commission \u2014 like OPAT, a product of the reform push that followed Floyd's murder. In June 2022, the POST Commission, as it\u2019s often called, mandated that investigations by police-oversight bodies like OPAT must be completed within 90 days unless an extension is granted. \u201cOur department has deep concerns about how this accelerated timeline will negatively impact our ability to be thorough throughout the course of our investigations,\u201d Everett said in the August 2022 report, adding that she hoped the POST Commission would rethink that requirement. Gianina Irlando, the president of the National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement, said a host of factors can lead to entities like OPAT starting their work more slowly than might be expected. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly difficult to start a new agency, especially one that has authority to investigate other agencies,\u201d Irlando said. \u201cYou have staff considerations, you have money considerations, you have authority considerations. And then you\u2019re going to have access situations \u2014 because even with proper authority in a piece of legislation, you don\u2019t necessarily have a good sense of what information is available, how to ask for it, and how to make it work in your own system.\u201d Irlando added that, because a single data point can have multiple explanations, it\u2019s risky to use specific numbers to assess an oversight entity\u2019s performance, either in isolation or comparison to other cities.For example, a low number of civilian complaints could indicate that community members don\u2019t know or trust a particular oversight agency \u2014 or that the police department that agency oversees is doing its job well. Sharon Fairley, a University of Chicago Law School professor who is tracking and analyzing the proliferation of oversight entities nationally, suggested that anyone sizing up the performance of one of those entities evaluate the quality of investigations it conducts. \u201cThe best way to assess how well an agency is performing is to be able to look at the work, and to be able to assess the quality of the work,\u201d Fairley said. \u201cAnd what\u2019s good about what\u2019s happening in Boston is, they are publicizing the reports of their investigations so that the public has the opportunity to say, \u2018OK. This is the evidence that they brought on. This is how they reached their conclusion.\u2019 And then that audience \u2014 the public \u2014 can decide whether or not they agree with that, or felt like that was the wrong outcome.\u201d Cases that have been voted on by the Civilian Review Board can be viewed online at the OPAT web page. They show that Civilian Review Board has consistently voted unanimously on a wide range of cases that seem to run the gamut from frivolous to serious. In one, a complainant claimed they\u2019d been treated rudely after greeting a BPD officer with profanity as part of an independent \u201caudit\u201d of the BPD\u2019s customer service. In another, a bystander contacted OPAT after witnessing an arrest in which they believed officers used excessive force and failed to inform a suspect of his rights. But Fairley, who led the transition from Chicago\u2019s old review board to the new Civilian Office of Police Accountability, also said that continued scrutiny is appropriate. In Chicago, she said, the former agency seemed to be designed well, but never delivered the level of oversight advocates had hoped for.\u201cOn paper, it looked fantastic,\u201d Fairley said. \u201cIt was independent, it had subpoena power, it had jurisdiction over the kind of cases that you want. ... But in execution, it just never developed the way it should have. \u201cYou are right to be watchful,\u201d she added. \u201cBecause we want to make sure these entities as they\u2019re created do sort of develop their wings, and [are] able to actually fulfill the mission they\u2019ve been given over time.\u201d",

        "body": "The families of military veterans who died of COVID-19 at the Soldiers\u2019 Home in Chelsea filed a class-action civil rights lawsuit against state officials over their relatives\u2019 \u201cpremature and preventable deaths\u201d under living conditions that were \u201cunsanitary, unfit, and unacceptable.\u201dThe lawsuit, filed in federal court in Boston Monday, alleges a series of actions \u2014 and failures to act \u2014 that led to the COVID-related deaths of at least 31 veterans who lived at the soldiers\u2019 home at the onset of the pandemic in 2020. Many of the veterans who died were highly decorated and had received awards, commendations and medals for their bravery, courage and accomplishments while serving their country during wartime.\u201cOur clients are American heroes,\u201d attorney Anthony Antonellis wrote in a statement to GBH News. Antonellis is a senior partner at Sloane and Walsh in Boston, which is representing the families.The defendants named in the lawsuit include former officials: Francisco Urena, secretary of the Department of Veterans\u2019 Services; Marylou Sudders, secretary of Health and Human Services; and Cheryl Lussier Poppe, superintendent of the Chelsea Soldiers\u2019 Home. The suit alleges the defendants \u201cwere recklessly and/or deliberately indifferent to the basic rights and needs of the veterans were under the care of the SHC [Soldiers\u2019 Home in Chelsea] in and after February of 2020.\u201d A spokesperson for the Executive Office of Health and Human Services said the office does not comment on pending litigation.The allegations in this lawsuit are similar to those that ended in a $56-million settlement the state paid to families of veterans infected with COVID-19 at the Holyoke Soldiers\u2019 Home. It\u2019s considered one of the earliest and deadliest U.S. outbreaks of COVID-19 with 84 deaths.\u201cWe are hoping to get answers for them [the veterans who died at Chelsea] and closure to the involved families to this devastating experience,\u201d said Antonellis. \u201cWe also hope this lawsuit prevents this improper treatment from ever happening again. We want to know why the soldiers home did not follow clearly established infectious disease protocols and why the home was unsanitary and unfit to live in.\u201dThe three plaintiffs are the families of Joseph \u201cRed\u201d Terenzio, an Army staff sergeant, Navy veteran John Sullivan and U.S. Coast Guard Master Chief Maurice Poulin. They\u2019re seeking compensatory and punitive damages \u201cfor the deprivation of the veterans\u2019 basic and constitutional rights.\u201dIn the years since, the state inspector general\u2019s office wrote that it has received several complaints about the soldiers\u2019 home. Last month, Inspector General Jeffrey Shapiro put out a letter that reports of the home\u2019s conditions in 2022 \u201c[paint] a grim picture,\u201d writing that veterans \u201chad been found lying \u2018soaked in urine and sitting in feces\u2019\u201d and that the conditions \u201cpoint to a catastrophic failure of the Home\u2019s leadership.\u201d \u201cWe want answers to why the veterans were deprived of basic and constitutional rights,\u201d Antonellis said, \u201cand most importantly we want current veterans to have excellent housing and care.

        "body": "\u201cLook for the helpers.\u201d That's what Mr. Rogers says his mother told him in scary situations. Over the last three years, we've certainly had to look to \u2014 and seek help from \u2014 the helpers. It\u2019s been physicians, nurses and all kinds of medical professionals who were the backbone of our society as a pandemic ravaged the world. But, where do the doctors look to? We expect them to be the strong ones in our society, but realistically, they're dealing with the challenges that the rest of us often face as well, like burnout or even imposter syndrome. Who helps the helpers? Who heals the healers? Dr. Gail Gazelle, assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and author of \u201cMindful M.D.: 6 Ways Mindfulness Restores Your Autonomy and Cures Healthcare Burnout,\u201d sat down with GBH\u2019s All Things Considered host Arun Rath to discuss how health care professionals can navigate healing themselves.Arun Rath: We did a show that I hosted for the first couple of years of the pandemic called In It Together, and I talked to a lot of medical professionals while things were especially crazy. Has anything gotten easier? Is there less stigma in terms of physicians and medical professionals seeking out help?Gail Gazelle: This is such an important topic \u2014 because levels of burnout in medical professionals were high pre-pandemic. And as we all know, the stresses on the health care system and medical providers were really phenomenal in the three years that we\u2019ve seen in the pandemic. It would be wonderful to think that now that we\u2019re at a different point in the pandemic, those stresses have decreased, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the case. As we all know, the pandemic fueled the Great Resignation, and there are tremendous levels of understaffing of physicians, nurses, technicians, therapists. What that means is the ones who remain in the workforce are bearing the burden of all of that understaffing. Additionally, we\u2019re in such a state of polarization in our society, aren\u2019t we? The impact that that\u2019s had on health care has also been unprecedented, like the levels of violence and threats towards members of the medical and nursing professions. All of this is bearing down on our already-weakened health care system, and I think the impact on physicians, nurses and others really cannot be understated. Rath: This is a new thing, right? There used to be a universal reverence \u2014 for understandable reasons \u2014 for people working in health care, people on the front lines. That just fractured in a way that it seems like it\u2019s not going to heal. Gazelle: It\u2019s a concerning time. Statistics from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics show that injuries due to violent attacks on health care professionals went up 67% between 2011 and 2018. We don\u2019t have better statistics than that currently, but one can imagine that those levels of violence \u2014 just like we\u2019re seeing high levels of violence in other sectors of society \u2014 are increasing in health care, which really is a microcosm of the broader society that we live in in the United States. So I hope that we can talk a little bit about, well, how can we help health care professionals cope? How can we give them the skills that they don\u2019t necessarily get in their training to weather all of the difficulties we\u2019re seeing? Rath: Let\u2019s talk about that. There\u2019s been a whole new group of people who have become medical professionals in the last couple of years while all of this is going on. Are there resources for people to get the help they need so they can keep on?Gazelle: The good news is that there are more resources than there were even a decade ago. Unfortunately, in our medical training, we learn to always be the captain, to always have the right answer, to never show weakness and to never call in sick \u2014 heaven forbid. That\u2019s something that I don\u2019t know has changed significantly, and I think that\u2019s an area where we can be training people in a different way. We can be training them that it\u2019s perfectly normal to have vulnerabilities; that\u2019s part of the human condition. So we really want to help physicians, in particular, to step away from that sense that if they seek help, if they see a coach, a mental health professional, etc., that somehow, that can be used against them. Rath: Is that changing now? Is there any kind of push to change that from the medical school level and up?Gazelle: There\u2019s a tremendous focus now on wellness for physicians, everything from the American Medical Association to the American College of Physicians \u2014 really, to almost every professional society that physicians engage in \u2014 have turned an eye toward wellness. So I think that\u2019s very hopeful news. How much of that has actually changed the patterns of medical training and medical school residencies and fellowships is unclear. I think there\u2019s still room for improvement. You know, we used to think about the medical profession as somewhat of a dinosaur profession, that change really took a very long time. But I want to hold out hope that that type of change can occur because, again, the physician workforce is suffering, and we need to do everything that we can \u2014 as early in the career trajectory of the future physician as we can \u2014 to give them the skills that they need to weather all of the difficulties that are occurring in our health care system.Rath: I know that what you\u2019ve looked at in your work has to do with long-term trauma, as well as short-term and immediate stresses. Talk about some of the particulars that people on the front lines in health care have had to deal with.Gazelle: I recall coaching a physician in New York City who was just burned out to a crisp, really wasn\u2019t sure if he could go on in his career. He told me about all of the deaths that he was seeing, having to tell the husband of the mother of their teenage sons that she had died and that he hadn\u2019t been able to save her from COVID. What was really interesting was that the physician wasn\u2019t focusing on the good that he was able to do. In other words, his training had taught him that he was a failure if he couldn\u2019t cure disease, or if he couldn\u2019t heal or couldn\u2019t increase longevity. His focus was on what he was not able to do, and that was really too much. He needed the sustenance of really focusing on the good that he was able to do. It also gives us a little bit of a clue of one action we can take to help decrease burnout and really restore that sense of meaning and purpose that all physicians deserve to have.Rath: That one action you mentioned is mindfulness, which you go into detail about in your upcoming book, \u201cMindful M.D.: 6 Ways Mindfulness Restores Your Autonomy and Cures Healthcare Burnout.\u201d Can you talk a little more about that?Gazelle: You know, I think that when people hear the word \u201cmindfulness,\u201d they have an image of monks meditating on a mountaintop \u2014 and that certainly is part of mindfulness. Really, what I get at in my book and what I do with the physicians that I coach is really thinking about mindfulness as mental training, really learning how to become the master of one\u2019s mind, as opposed to the captive. In that example that I just gave, mental training helped [the NYC physician] helped him shift his focus and helped him really be aware of where his mind was focusing, which was not helping him. So the mental training of mindfulness helped him step out of the kind of blinders that we can have when we\u2019re in burnout when we don\u2019t see the good that we\u2019re doing.",

        "body": "Every week, GBH News assignment editor Matt Baskin joins GBH\u2019s All Things Considered to look at stories the newsroom is following. This week, tune in for updates on Gov. Maura Healey's soon-to-be-released budget, a local sheriff's plan to hire 19-year-olds as correctional officers and the state of Salem's mayoral race. What follows is a lightly edited transcript of the conversation between Baskin and host Arun Rath. Arun Rath: So tomorrow is the first day of March and Gov. Healey is expected to release her proposal for the state\u2019s budget. We had some teasers last week, but do we have any sense of what else we might be looking for? Matt Baskin: A bunch of things, both within the budget plan itself and in the process surrounding it. I was talking about this with our State House reporter Katie Lannan earlier. We\u2019re expecting Healey to devote some attention to, no surprise, the T. I won\u2019t list all the disasters the T has dealt with this past year \u2014 there was one just this morning that caused power to go out across the whole system \u2014 but one big overarching issue that\u2019s been the source of a lot of other problems is lack of staffing. Healey has said she wants to put money towards hiring 1,000 new workers for the T. Solving the staffing problem could be a real step in the right direction, but if Healey does indeed put a big chunk of money into hiring, there\u2019s still the issue of actually attracting workers. The T has been running its own major hiring campaign the past several months, but the staffing shortage still persists. So we\u2019ll see if more money can help solve it.Something else to look for is whether Healey keeps her pledge to put 1% of her budget to environmental agencies. And we\u2019ll also find out if Healey holds true to the promise she made in her inaugural address to make community college free for folks 25 and older who don\u2019t yet have a degree. Beyond just the numbers, the line items, we\u2019ll see if there\u2019s significant policy written into this spending plan. That would be a way for Healey to say, \u201cThis is a priority for me.\u201dAnd then outside the budget itself and looking at the process, this is going to be an opportunity to really see how the new governor works with the Legislature. This is Healey\u2019s first budget season. In the weeks ahead, the state Senate and the Massachusetts House will be coming out with their own proposed budgets, and leaders from both of those chambers and the governor will have to hammer out some sort of compromise. It\u2019s yet to be seen whether that\u2019ll be easy or hard, acrimonious or drama-free, but it\u2019ll help set the tone for what Healey\u2019s relationship with the Legislature is gonna be like for the next four years and how our state government is going to function.Rath: You mentioned staffing shortages with the T. Staffing shortages are also apparently behind the Essex County sheriff\u2019s plan to drop the minimum hiring age for corrections officers \u2014 that\u2019s jail guards \u2014 from 21 to 19. We heard a little bit about that yesterday, but we\u2019re doing some follow-up reporting on that, right?Baskin: Yeah, you know, it's in process. Diego Lopez, senior producer for GBH's All Things Considered, spoke with Essex County sheriff Kevin Coppinger about this yesterday. Coppinger says that his office \u2014 like you mentioned, like the T, like so many businesses \u2014 is dealing with staffing issues, and lowering the hiring age is meant to deal with that. And he made the point that this isn\u2019t necessarily unprecedented. He says his office has hired 19-year-olds in decades past, and that other county sheriffs in Massachusetts and across the country have too. I think the idea of 19-year-olds working a job like this doesn\u2019t sit well with some people. These are still technically teenagers. A two-year difference might feel arbitrary to some, but corrections officers do a difficult job and they wield a lot of power over other people\u2019s lives. So right now we\u2019re checking in with other county sheriffs\u2019 offices around the commonwealth \u2014 as well as the Massachusetts Department of Correction, which handles state-level prisons \u2014 to see what their minimum hiring age is. And we\u2019re trying to speak with other professionals in law enforcement and with advocacy groups to get their take on whether this is a reasonable way to deal with staffing problems.Rath: Before you go, we\u2019re still feeling some of the effects of the new government that's in place now. With Maura Healey taking office last month, we\u2019ve recently had state Rep. Jon Santiago leave his seat in the House to serve in Healey\u2019s cabinet. And, of course, Kim Driscoll left a void in Salem when she resigned as that city\u2019s mayor to become lieutenant governor. What\u2019s the state of things in Salem now? Baskin: I know we\u2019re short on time, so real quick: there are five candidates in the running. I won\u2019t name all of them, but the field includes the Salem city councilor who\u2019s right now serving as acting mayor. There\u2019s also Kim Driscoll\u2019s chief of staff from when she ran the city. And there\u2019s a former mayor of Salem who preceded Driscoll in office, back in the \u201990s, and three decades later is coming back for more. The candidates are taking part in a mayoral forum this evening, which we\u2019ll be covering, and Salem voters will narrow the field of five down to two in a preliminary election that\u2019s scheduled for March 28, a month from today. And then there'll be a final election that\u2019s scheduled for May 16. Rath: I guess we just can't get enough elctions. Matt, thank you.Baskin: Thank you Arun.",

        "body": "The Essex County Sheriff\u2019s Office on Monday lowered the age requirement for correctional officers from 21 to 19 years old.Essex County Sheriff Kevin Coppinger said it\u2019s been a struggle to maintain staffing levels at the second-largest jail in Massachusetts, in part because of increasing anti\u2013law enforcement sentiments. The county previously added a $2,500 hiring bonus to attract workers. Now, Coppinger is hoping the lower age requirement \u2014 combined with the state's tuition remission program \u2014 will appeal to more applicants.Essex is not the only Massachusetts county to employ 19-year-old correctional officers. Still, some people criticized the decision.\u201cSome people will argue they might not be mature enough, but we're going to do extensive background checks to all our board interviews, we have our own academy so we can make sure we're training them properly,\u201d Coppinger said.\u201cThere's some immature 19-year-olds out there, but I run into immature 20-year-olds, 30-year-olds, 40-year-olds, all the way up the gamut,\u201d he added. \u201cSo it's a look at the individual, not just the particular group, and let the individual make their case to convince us that we should take a chance on them and they take a chance on us.\u201dCoppinger added that the sheriff\u2019s office has employed 19-year-olds in the past, and other counties also hire with a lower age requirement. Other counties in Massachusetts with a minimum hiring age of 19 for their correctional officers include Berkshire, Bristol, Dukes, Franklin and Hampshire counties, according to their position listings. The minimum age in Bristol County has been 19 since at least 1998, a spokesperson for the office said.In addition to concerns of maturity, some critics urge officials to look at further reforms. Liz Matos, the executive director of the Prisoners' Legal Services of Massachusetts, said instead of figuring out ways to attract more correctional officers, the state should implement reforms to decrease the overall number of people incarcerated.\u201cSome states and counties allow 19-year-olds to work as corrections officers,\u201d Matos said in an email statement. \u201cHowever, instead of lowering the age for hiring, steps like eliminating cash bail could be taken to reduce the need for additional hiring.\u201d About 65% of Essex County\u2019s incarcerated people were being held in pre-trial detention, according to January\u2019s state data.Some Massachusetts county sheriff offices still require a 21-year-old minimum to be a correctional officer, including Barnstable, Middlesex, Norfolk and Suffolk counties.Hampden County has allowed younger candidates into the training academy, but it is rare, a spokesperson for the sheriff\u2019s office said in an email statement.\u201cWhile the Hampden County Sheriff's Office has always required correctional officers to be at least 21 years of age, in very rare instances, we have allowed someone younger than 21 to enter one of our correctional officer academies,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThat has only happened as long as the recruit was at least 19 years of age, in accordance with Commonwealth of Massachusetts regulations.\u201dThe state Department of Corrections also requires candidates to be 21 years of age to be appointed as a correctional officer, but the entrance exam can be taken at 19, according to state law.Coppinger recognizes that even with the lowered age limit, the job won\u2019t appeal to everyone. One of his sons, for example, appreciates the ability to work remotely for his job. That\u2019s not an option for correctional officers.But for those who are looking for a \u201cstarting place to get in law enforcement,\u201d Coppinger thinks the job might align well with what many young adults are looking for.\u201cIt can be rewarding. It can be frustrating. I'm not going to sugarcoat it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut $68,000 annual salary starting in, all the overtime you want, the tuition program, it's got nice benefits working for the state of Massachusetts. It's just what people want.\u201d",

        "body": "MassLandlords, the nonprofit trade association that represents approximately 2,400 landlords across Greater Boston, is charging that Boston Mayor Michelle Wu\u2019s rent control proposal protects larger, corporate housing operators. \u201cThis rent control proposal could have gone any number of ways, but to us as small landlords, it seems to be the result of developer lobbying,\u201d said Douglas Quattrochi, MassLandlords\u2019 executive director. He stopped short of outrightly accusing the mayor of cronyism but noted that several members of the committee that helped craft Wu\u2019s proposal were contributors to at least one of her political campaigns. The trade group\u2019s newly filed lawsuit seeks to force the city to dilvulge documents that show how the members of the mayor\u2019s Rent Stabilization Advisory Committee were selected. \u201cWe actually asked a year ago to find out why MassLandlords and other landlord organizations weren\u2019t invited to the Rent Stabilization Advisory Committee. ... We got rejected in our records request,\u201d Quattrochi said. \u201cBut, then once the proposal came out, a whole bunch of warning bells started to go off because we looked at who was on the Rent Stabilization Advisory Committee and, in terms of campaign dollars donated, it's all developers. And you look at who's exempted under the rent control proposal and it's developers.\u201cSo we're trying to find out and we're trying to show if lobbying was at play here in the creation of this rent control proposal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s going to benefit developers more than landlords and renters.\u201d\u201cThe public has an interest in knowing what communications passed between [the city of Boston] and who became members of the committee, how the Mayor came to choose those particular individuals, and what motivation may exist for them to persist in advocating for policies know to economists and to the general public to be harmful and contrary to the public interest,\u201d a portion of the legal complaint reads.Quattrochi noted that MassLandlords, which is based in Cambridge, was not invited to take part in the proposal\u2019s crafting. Less than 5% of MassLandlords\u2019 members reside in Boston. An even smaller portion operate housing within the city. Wu is seeking to set up a local rent control option for Boston, despite the policy being banned by statewide referendum in 1994. It would require approval from Boston City Council, the state Legislature and the governor to become law.The mayor\u2019s proposal, now before the City Council, would restrict yearly rent increases to a maximum of 10% in high inflation years and the rate of inflation plus 6% in average years. Wu\u2019s exemptions include: a 15-year shield for both new and past construction starting from the year the building\u2019s certificate of occupancy was issued, and another for landlords who own six units or less and live on site with their tenants. Quattrochi said these exemptions leave out a large swath of landlords that could still reasonably be considered small and would be unfairly burdened. \u201cIf [the mayor] had actually talked to us, or invited us to sit on the committee, she would\u2019ve heard immediately that there are so many of our members who live across the street from their properties or in the same neighborhood around the corner from [them], but they\u2019re not in their properties,\u201d he said.Wu\u2019s proposal also calls for a rent control board or administrator to oversee local rent regulation. Quattrochi said that could create problems for small landlords who may end up needing to ask for permission to make certain improvements to their properties as they did under past rent control regulations while developers enjoy an extended exemption. Stakeholders across Greater Boston\u2019s development sector are now publicly speaking out against Wu\u2019s effort. The Greater Boston Real Estate launched a $400,000 campaign against rent control this month. The mayor has dismissed criticism of her proposal, insisting that it is the balanced approach necessary to allow stability for both housing operators and renters.While appearing on WBUR\u2019s \u201cRadio Boston\u201d earlier this week, Wu expressed confidence that the transparency concerns raised in the lawsuit will be \u201csorted out,\u201d and said, \u201cmany of the special interest groups who might be either listening to fearmongering or practicing fearmongering here really are just trying to stop a policy that that people are scared of.\u201d \u201cWhether it\u2019s a group that is trying to put a lawsuit forward to just add more news and make sure that there\u2019s as much potential delay in the process as possible, to others who are putting money behind an effort to put a message out there that this is taking us backwards, or assert that City Hall can\u2019t do math or this or that \u2014 this is a different proposal that we\u2019re putting forward now compared to what used to exist in Massachusetts and in many places decades ago, or even in some of the cities that are being brought up as examples of what to avoid,\u201d Wu said.Quattrochi insisted the trade group will see the records request through.\u201cIf there were something in the emails, I think it would just further discredit the mayor\u2019s proposal,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this rent control thing is just some incomprehensible distraction at best, and I'm worried that it\u2019s actually been a lobbying effort of nonprofit and for-profit developers here. ... Whatever we find, we\u2019re going to continue to look into this.\u201d Last March, the group unsuccessfully attempted to obtain \u201cany and all City of Boston emails to, from, or cc\u2019ing\u201d advisory committee members for the year before Wu announced them, according to the lawsuit filed late last week. The administration, after prodding from the state, only returned a welcome email dated the day after Wu publicly announced advisory committee members and a response stating that invitations to the committee were given through phone calls. \u201cThe implication that in the period March 2021 to March 2022 there were absolutely no email communications between any City department and any of the individuals who went on to become members of the Mayor\u2019s Rent Stabilization Committee struck [MassLandlords] as not credible,\u201d the lawsuit said.The filing goes on to decry rent control as a policy that will cause \u201cavailability discrimination,\u201d a phenomenon where landlords hold properties vacant in order to select tenants with good credit scores and high income. MassLandlords\u2019 legal complaint also implied a connection between the advisory committee members and contributions to various campaigns for public office. Seventeen of the 25 members put money toward \u201cMassachusetts political races,\u201d the lawsuit alleges.The group, Quattrochi said, is opposed to rent control in all forms, but would support a \u201cChapter 40P\u201d program \u2014 named for the state law rent control carveout that allows cities and towns to enact rent control and pay landlords the difference between market rent rates and controlled rents.",

        "body": "The Massachusetts Board of Elementary and Secondary Education on Tuesday approved a proposal for a new charter school in Worcester, despite widespread opposition to the school among Worcester officials. The board\u2019s 7-4 vote means the proposed Worcester Cultural Academy can move forward with plans to open the free elementary charter school in August. By state law, Worcester\u2019s public school district will have to help fund the charter school. That requirement set off intense criticism of the proposal in recent months, with opponents saying the money could better be used for other public schools in a district that has been underfunded. \u201cI am incredibly disheartened by this decision. The children and families of Worcester deserve schools that serve all students and families \u2014 not a select few,\u201d Worcester Public Schools Superintendent Rachel Mon\u00e1rrez said in a statement following the vote. The board meeting Tuesday encapsulated months of disagreement between supporters and proponents of the charter school. During a public comment period, more than a dozen people \u2014 including Mon\u00e1rrez, Worcester Mayor Joseph Petty and other local elected officials \u2014 spoke against the charter school. They criticized the school\u2019s financial ties with its sponsor, the Old Sturbridge Village historical museum, as well as its lack of detailed planning on how it will serve high-needs children. But advocates pushed back, saying the charter school will provide Worcester students an alternative to regular public schools. Members of the board who supported the proposal agreed with that assertion. They said the school met all necessary criteria for new charter schools and pointed to the recommendation from Jeff Riley, commissioner of the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, that the board approve it. \u201cI have become used to these controversial topics \u2014 just sort of groups pounding and pounding away at certain points as if it becomes more true simply by continuing to pound away at it,\u201d board Vice Chair Matt Hills said. \u201cThe law is the law. The criteria is set out.\u201d According to the Worcester Cultural Academy\u2019s application to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, the free charter school will initially serve students in kindergarten up to fourth grade before expanding up to eighth grade for a capacity of 360 students. Its design is based on another charter school already in operation, Old Sturbridge Academy, which also partners with the Old Sturbridge Village historical museum.Worcester Cultural Academy will include programming and instruction from local museums, such as the Hanover Theater and Conservatory, Worcester Art Museum and Old Sturbridge Village. The district says the charter school will cost about $7 million annually once it reaches full enrollment, which Worcester Public Schools will have to fund out of a new allotment of money from the statewide Student for Opportunity Act. Since the academy applied to the state for its charter, Worcester city officials have repeatedly raised questions about the school\u2019s partnership with Old Sturbridge Village. The historical museum's CEO Jim Donahue, who\u2019s also a founder of the Worcester Cultural Academy, has said the money generated from the school will help cover expenses at the museum. \u201cThe Academies will provide reliable, contractual revenue to the museum, safeguarding us against fluctuations in uncontrollable facts that impact admission revenue such as weather and public health,\u201d Donahue wrote in a 2022 annual report for the museum. State law prohibits the charter school from using public money for a private institution like the museum. Concerns about Donohue\u2019s comments prompted the Worcester School Committee on Monday to request a state investigation into the museum\u2019s relationship with the new charter school. Some board members expressed similar uneasiness before their vote Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to provide a financial lifeboat for a museum,\u201d board member Eric Plankey said. Tuesday was the third time Patrick Tutwiler joined a Board of Elementary and Secondary Education meeting since Gov. Maura Healey appointed him as secretary of education in December. Tutwiler voted against the charter school, saying he questions the school\u2019s ability to teach students still learning how to speak English. He noted 30% of Worcester\u2019s student body is multilingual, but the group running the school lacks experience teaching non-native English speakers. \u201cI am agnostic as to the governance model and sector of a school,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I am not agnostic on are the values of equity, access and excellence.\u201d",

        "body": "Boston will distribute $1 million in grants to organizations that provide services for people leaving prisons and jails, part of an effort to help formerly incarcerated people live stable lives, Mayor Michelle Wu announced Tuesday morning. The money will be split among 35 organizations. Nearly all of it \u2014 80 percent \u2014 will go to 29 organizations led by people of color or formerly incarcerated people. More than 3,000 people exit incarceration each year in Boston according to the Office of Returning Citizens. \u201cWrapping around our returning citizens with programming and services is vital to ensuring formerly incarcerated individuals are able to return to their lives and community successfully,\u201d Wu said in a statement. Among the organizations is Justice 4 Housing, an organization that advocates for ending the incarceration of women and girls and works with formerly incarcerated people to find stable housing. \u201cStable housing is the most crucial resource to promoting public safety, public health and circumventing recidivism,\u201d Leslie Credle, the organization\u2019s founder and executive director, said in a statement. \u201cI am living proof that housing is the gateway to a successful reentry. Our programs have provided permanent housing and legal advocacy support for over 100 formerly incarcerated people in our communities.\u201dJos\u00e9 Mass\u00f3, Boston's chief of Human Services, said the highest grant amounts of $60,000 were given to four organizations. Mass\u00f3 said nearly 60 organizations applied for grants and the city hoped that spreading small grants evenly would help build a \"collective network\" of grassroots providers for the future. He said the city recognizes services are needed to support people even before they exit prison. \"As a city agency... partnering with these organizations definitely does allow us to do that,\" Mass\u00f3 said. Dorchester-based New Beginnings Reentry Services, which runs a 10-bed residential program for women coming out of state and federal prison, received a $60,000 grant. It was among a group of organizations made up of returning citizens who wrote to the city in mid-February saying the ORC's grant process disadvantaged smaller community-lead organizations with crucial \"lived experience.\" The organizations said that smaller organizations, especially those led by people typically excluded because of their race or gender, often don\u2019t have business advisors or grant writers to help them navigate the process. Founder Stacey Borden, who is Black and herself exited prison 13 years ago, said it took her two years to set up the residential program, and she continues to struggle to pay expenses, including insurance and salary for employees. She welcomed the grant funding, but said smaller organizations led by people of color, and which have \"direct experience\" with the populations they are helping, will need further support and alliances with the city to continue their work. \"It's all just trying to connect. How do you handle community? You're got to create these allies, right?\" Borden said. Baystate Reentry Network, which works exclusively to help men and women who have been previously convicted of a sex offense and have to register upon their release, received a $10,000 grant. Executive Director Bill Canavan said helping formerly incarerated people ultimately helps everyone in society. \"The cost of someone being homeless, the cost of someone being incarcerated, the cost of someone going through the court system, the assignment of counsel, the judges, the jury, transportation. It goes on and on,\" Canavan said, \"There are so many hidden costs to crime that I believe, anyway, all taxpayers should be interested in.\"",

        "body": "Cryptocurrencies have altered our financial landscape and transformed how many people think about banking. They have also generated legal questions, including those from the notorious Sam Bankman-Fried scandal and a more recent Massachusetts case that involves allegations of stealing electricity to pursue a crypto-mining operation. GBH legal analyst and Northeastern law professor Daniel Medwed joined Morning Edition hosts Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel to talk about cryptocurrency and the legal landscape surrounding it. This transcript has been lightly edited. Paris Alston: If there's anyone who can untangle these two complicated things, Daniel, we know it is you. So tell us, how does crypto mining work? Daniel Medwed: I asked our associate producers, Rachel and Gal, to give me their twenty-something take on this, so they've informed me. Here's my best impression of what's going on. Generally speaking, cryptocurrency is a form of digital coin where you use the encryption algorithms, that's where the term crypto comes from, to generate and amass wealth that you can trade online that's outside the regular banking system, outside the regular currency regime. And that's part of the appeal, that there's limited government oversight. That's one of the reasons people are drawn to this sector. Now, in terms of crypto mining in particular, here's how it works: you run these supercomputers to solve complex mathematical equations. That's how you produce the digital coins. Then you validate those transactions by putting them on something called the blockchain, and then you can locate the transactions and your wealth essentially through a virtual ledger. So that's sort of the big picture view of how crypto works.Jeremy Siegel: I think that is about as far as my knowledge goes. For anybody who's still confused by it, crypto mining is like if you took real-world mining but put it on a computer and instead of mining, you're doing equations. Medwed: Right. Exactly. Siegel: So Daniel, you mentioned that a lot of people are attracted to crypto because of the absence of significant government oversight, But the absence of government oversight can also make it easy for people to commit crimes, for people to be defrauded, right? Medwed: I think that's absolutely right. It's a little bit like the Wild West out there, where we're still trying to figure out how to regulate this industry. And that often happens with new financial markets, new trading vehicles, things like hedge funds years ago and the Sam Bankman-Fried or SBF scandal, I think is really illustrative. So in short, here's what happened there. SBF ran a crypto derivatives fund called FTX, and he allegedly used customer assets to cover liabilities for an affiliated research company, Alameda Research. He fled to the Bahamas and he was extradited from there after he was charged with eight federal crimes back in December, including securities fraud and wire fraud. Now he's back in the U.S. And just last week, the feds tacked on an additional four charges related to illegal political donations. So I think SBF is a really high-profile and perhaps extreme example of potential fraud in the industry. Billions of dollars are in play there. Alston: Yeah, I mean, speaking of Tik Tok, I know the Internet had a field day with SBF and continues to, right? I'm looking at a meme now, you know, the one with the dog and everything is on fire and he has a cup of coffee? He's like, This is fine. It has a huge picture of Sam Bankman-Fried on the front. And wasn't he the son of two Stanford law professors? Medwed: That's right. He was the son of two Stanford law professors. And there's also a local connection, isn't there always a local connection? He went to MIT. Siegel: Oh, wow. SBF Going to MIT and starting FTX. All those acronyms are almost making this more confusing for me. So, Daniel, let's get closer to home. Talk about this case in Cohasset, which involves that other end of things, crypto mining, right? Medwed: Absolutely. So apparently back in December 2021, the facilities manager for the Cohasset Middle and High School noticed that something was awry on campus. He saw this odd array of electrical wires, computers and temporary duct work. So together with the town's I.T. director, they started to investigate and they identified a crypto mining operation that was in a crawl space on campus, and that was connected to the school's electrical system. So they called the police. The police called in some federal investigators who conducted a forensic accounting or examination of these computers. And after a three-month investigation or so, they identified the assistant town facilities manager, a guy named Nadeam Nahas, as the culprit. And apparently, he was accused at least of stealing about $18,000 worth of electricity from the school district. Alston: It seems like he was essentially doing this to save money, right? Because I understand that crypto mining can rack up quite the electricity bill. Medwed: Yeah, that's my hunch. I'm not entirely sure, but that seems to be a reasonable inference here, Paris. It takes a staggering amount of electricity, of power, to run a crypto mining operation. You have to keep those supercomputers running fast and as long as possible. And in addition, you have to run fans to prevent the computers from overheating. By one estimate, the amount of power required to run crypto mining for a year across the world is the equivalent of the amount of power required to keep the lights on in a medium-sized European country for a full year, like the Netherlands. So I think crypto not just implicates financial and legal issues, but also environmental ones as well. Siegel: Daniel, what's the status of the Cohasset case at the moment? Medwed: Nahas was charged with vandalism and fraudulent taking of electrical services in Quincy District Court, but apparently he didn't show up for his court appearance last week, last Thursday, which led to the issuance of an arrest warrant. So I think we'll have to stay tuned and keep the lights on.",

        "body": "Although there's been plenty of sunshine to start our workweek, clouds and snow are on the way. The storm system, which will bring the wintry weather, is currently in the middle of the Ohio Valley headed east. You can see the spinning low pressure area in the middle of the satellite image above. This will redevelop a new storm south of New England on Tuesday, which will head out to sea Tuesday night and Wednesday.Snow should arrive in greater Boston around midnight, but will be falling earlier by a few hours across the Berkshires. When you get up Tuesday morning snow will be falling at a moderate clip and I expect it to continue to accumulate. The map below shows current estimates for snowfall totals.The snow will be heavier and wet right along the coastline, therefore it will not accumulate as efficiently and it is likely to mix with or even change to rain for a time south of Boston. A later change or mix will allow for slightly higher totals in the city, but if it changes to a mixed bag earlier the lower estimates will result.Either way, all areas are likely to be plowing and shoveling. I expect widespread school cancellations and some delays at Logan airport as well as cancellations of smaller flights. The winter severity index below is an estimate of how impactful these types of storms can be. Notice we are at the lower end of impact meaning while things will be slow Tuesday, it's certainly not a day in which you won't be able to get out and about.The precipitation will wind down on Tuesday night and we should see a return to some sunshine for Wednesday with melting temperatures in the lower 40s. It turns somewhat wet Wednesday night and Thursday with rain showers. Another storm arrives for Friday or Saturday, with snow and rain depending on the exact track of that particular storm.",

        "body": "Gov. Maura Healey is proposing a $742 million package of tax cuts in the state budget she will file Wednesday, offering relief for parents, renters and seniors alongside other tax reforms. Healey's plan shares common ground with the tax proposal former Gov. Charlie Baker could not get over the finish line his final year in office, and it features some other measures that have been kicking around Beacon Hill for years, like a new live theater tax credit and changes to the way locally produced hard cider is taxed. Announced Monday morning at the Demakes Family YMCA in Lynn, the tax package is centered around a child and family tax credit that Healey touted on the campaign trail. Healey's office said 700,000 taxpayers would benefit from the $600 per-dependent credit, helping them keep up with climbing costs for child and senior care. The child and family tax credit, for children under 13, people with disabilities and senior dependents age 65 and up, combines two interrelated existing benefits \u2014 the Household Dependent Tax Credit and Dependent Care Tax Credit \u2014 while removing the cap on dependents, and increasing the benefits. At a cost to the state of $458 million for the next budget year, it's the single largest piece of Healey's proposal. Healey said she and Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll are filing this package for people \"who are struggling to get by as the cost of living continues to skyrocket past them \u2013 the family watching their grocery bill grow each week, the young mom who wants to return to her dream job but can\u2019t afford child care, the recent college graduate who can\u2019t afford both his rent and student loan payments, the seniors who want to keep the home where they raised their family.\"Along with the child and family credit, the plan would increase the rental deduction from $3,000 to $4,000, and double to $2,400 a credit for low-income seniors paying property taxes or rent. In a pair of moves Healey described as ways to make Massachusetts more competitive with other states, the bill would use credits to eliminate the estate tax \u2014 which currently kicks in at $1 million \u2014 for estates valued up to $3 million, and cut the tax rate on short-term capital gains to 5% from 12%Last year, Baker filed a nearly $700 million tax plan that also would have boosted credits for dependent and child care, increased the rental deduction, doubled credits for seniors, reformed the estate tax and cut the short-term capital gains tax. The House and Senate each passed different tax relief bills last year, never agreeing on specifics. Ultimately, legislative leaders shelved the bills after realizing the state would be returning $3 billion in excess revenues to residents, pledging to revisit the issue this year. Senate President Karen Spilka, at the start of the session in January, called for lawmakers to pass progressive tax relief \u201csoon.\u201d Tax policy bills, though, must start in the House, where Speaker Ron Mariano has talked about watching the state\u2019s fiscal picture before acting. Healey\u2019s tax package would also: expand the list of occupations that qualify for apprenticeship tax credits, and double the statewide cap on those credits to $5 million;increase the cap on Housing Development Incentive Program credits, with the goal of producing more market-rate housing in gateway cities;increase the cap to $8 million for the state's dairy tax credit, which Massachusetts Dairy Farmers Association President David Shepard said would \"greatly help offset the forecasted difficult times ahead in dairy costs of production and pricing\";exempt employer assistance with student loan repayment from taxable income;expand tax-deductible commuter transit benefits to include regional transit passes and bike commuter expenses;double the credit for lead paint abatement, and double the maximum credit for septic tank repair or replacement in a primary residence, and;extend the expiring brownfields tax credit for cleanup of contaminated properties through 2028.",

        "body": "A word to those working hard to make sure that Black history is erased: It\u2019s going to be harder than you think. Sure, you\u2019ve banned books by Black people writing about America\u2019s fraught racial history, and passed legislation censoring classroom discussions about the breadth and depth of African-Americans\u2019 contributions to our nation. The opening narration for \u201cThe 1619 Project,\u201d the new Hulu series based on the New York Time series of the same name, puts it plainly: \u201cAlmost nothing in our country has been left untouched by the legacy and the contributions of Black Americans.\u201d As any informed person knows, history is inescapable \u2014 because today is rooted in the past. Even banned and censored history finds its way into the center of the public conversation of the moment. As I was recently reminded when the Super Bowl teams were announced \u2014 say what? I know some of you who know me are asking. How is it that I \u2014 an avowed couldn\u2019t-care-less sports person \u2014 was paying attention to football\u2019s most important game? Easy \u2014 I sat up and took notice the minute the sports analysts pointed out that for the first time ever in the 56-year history of the Super Bowl, both competing teams had Black quarterbacks. Kansas City Chiefs Patrick Mahomes and Philadelphia Eagles Jalen Hurts made history \u2014 Black History. The news transcended viral with endless discussions on every media platform. There was no getting away from the profiles of both young men, the multiple interviews asking each of them to reflect on the importance, and the particular pride of Black fans. My Dad would have had the story on a loop. I remember Daddy told me the Black players were shut out from playing quarterback because the decision-makers assumed they didn\u2019t have the intellect needed to strategize for the team. How you like me now Florida Governor Ron DeSantis? You, who are focused on ripping African American history from books and classrooms? You can\u2019t stop the kids from witnessing talent and triumph overcoming racial bias. You might want to brush up on the words to \u201cLift Every Voice and Sing,\u201d the Negro National Anthem.Even sweeter, Mahomes and Hurts were not the only recent Black firsts breaking down restricted classroom walls. Here at home, Mount Holyoke College named Danielle Ren Holley as the first Black president in the college\u2019s 186-year history. She\u2019ll be the fourth Black woman to helm one of the original Seven Sisters colleges. Two others based in Massachusetts, Wellesley and Smith, are also led by Black women.I\u2019ll close out this short list of living Black history makers with another sports highlight: Basketball superstar LeBron James toppling the awe-inspiring record of retired Kareem Abul Jabbar, taking the number one spot on the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring list. Both men never fail to put their achievements within the larger context of Black history. In this last week of Black History Month, I\u2019m heartened that even if some don\u2019t like it, Americans are still learning Black history through these current stories \u2014 stories that are now forever etched into the stone of American history.",

        "body": "Dave Vespucci has fantasized about one thing for the past year: to relax in his reclining chair in a home he doesn\u2019t have to worry about leaving. For more than two decades, Vespucci, 75, was able to do that in a sky blue duplex in a quiet residential neighborhood in Worcester. He was a good tenant, who always paid his rent on time and helped maintain the property. But around late 2021, with housing values and rents across Worcester surging, his landlord decided he would renovate and sell the duplex for a profit. Vespucci had to move out. Vespucci, who\u2019s diabetic and has a bad back after working decades in the construction industry, then spent over a year looking for a new apartment he could afford. He had a February 2023 deadline to leave the duplex, and feared homelessness as he struggled to find apartments within his budget \u2014 about $1,300 a month, split with his daughter. Finally in January, just three weeks before the deadline, Vespucci found a unit in a three-decker. Although about 90 other people applied for the apartment, the landlord sympathized with him and agreed to lease it to him. \u201cI\u2019m thankful for sure. It was a godsend,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t hear of these kinds of things.\u201d GBH News has followed Vespucci for the past year as part of the series \u201cPriced Out: The fight for housing in Massachusetts.\u201d His journey exemplifies a worsening problem in New England\u2019s second largest city, which used to be affordable for local workers but now is a hotbed for rising housing costs. Typical monthly rents in Worcester are up more than $600 since 2016, according to Zillow, and about half of all renters are cost-burdened, paying more than a third of their income on rent and utilities. Housing advocates say the problem stems from Worcester\u2019s dearth of apartments affordable for low- to moderate-income households. Although thousands of new rental units have hit the city\u2019s housing market in recent years, they\u2019re too expensive for many people who work in Worcester. Instead, they tailor to higher-earning people with jobs based in Boston and MetroWest. Despite its hot market, Worcester\u2019s monthly median rent of $1,850 is significantly less than that of Boston \u2014 $3,250. As a result, Worcester is an attractive place to reside for people who work in the Boston area but don\u2019t want to pay to live there. Worcester is just over an hourlong trip from Boston on the commuter rail. \u201cIt\u2019s very excruciating,\u201d said Yvette Dyson, executive director of Worcester Common Ground \u2014 a nonprofit that builds affordable housing. \u201cWe see the tradeoff of people coming to Worcester.\u201d Worcester officials acknowledge the city\u2019s affordable housing shortage is pricing out local workers and have taken steps like creating a trust fund to address the problem. Another policy that would mandate that all new housing complexes include a certain percentage of units affordable for lower-income households, known as inclusionary zoning, is mired in debate.Around the time GBH first profiled Vespucci in June 2022, his landlord had just agreed to give him an extension until February 2023 to move out. Vespucci was relieved but knew what he was up against.He had already spent six months scouring through online apartment listings trying to find something he could afford. The stress of the ordeal caused him to lose 20 pounds, which destabilized his diabetes and brought on dizziness, sweating and fatigue. \u201cAll this is too much for people who are in my position,\u201d Vespucci said in May. \u201cIt\u2019s not right.\u201d Over the next four months, Vespucci continued looking for apartments but his luck with the housing search and his personal life only worsened. First, he caught pneumonia, then his brother died. In October, he secured an apartment in Southbridge, a half-hour\u2019s drive from Worcester. His lease would start in February after some renovation work on the unit. Although he preferred to stay closer to Worcester \u2014 where his doctors are \u2014 he concluded the apartment was his only option. But in January as he began boxing up his belongings and preparing to move to Southbridge, he learned the renovation work was delayed and the lease fell through. His deadline to move out was now three weeks away, and he started panicking.\u201cI can\u2019t live on the street,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cI\u2019m just frazzled. I haven\u2019t slept.\u201d At that point, Vespucci and his daughter went into \u201cdesperation mode,\u201d frantically calling services that help seniors with housing. His son, Nick, who lives in Maryland, joined the effort, cold-calling landlords with online apartment listings and telling them Vespucci\u2019s story. But all of the listings either were scams or had long waitlists.\u201cI was losing sleep over it,\u201d Nick said, \u201cjust kind of thinking, \u2018What are we going to do if the day comes,\u2019\u201d and the sheriff evicts him and he has nowhere to go. Finally, Nick reached Pam Kirk, a landlord with an open apartment in a Worcester triple-decker. Although about 90 other people had already applied for the unit, Kirk decided to give it to Vespucci after hearing about what he\u2019d been through. \u201cI felt bad,\u201d Kirk said. \u201cI could put myself in [his] position and think, \u2018Wow, what would I do?\u2019\u201dKirk is charging Vespucci and his daughter $1,300 a month in rent. The unit features polished wood floors, new appliances, a balcony with views of much of Worcester and a swimming pool in the backyard. The triple-decker is Kirk's only rental property, and she and her husband live on the first floor. Although she knows she can charge more for Vespucci's apartment, she wants to provide housing that\u2019s affordable for people. She also prefers to have the same tenants living in her two rental units for multiple years so she can avoid the process of having to find new tenants. Vespucci is thankful for that mentality. \u201c[She] saved me from the street,\u201d he said. Today, he can finally sit in his navy blue recliner, knowing he has a home he doesn\u2019t have to leave anytime soon. Still, he\u2019s in disbelief he came so close to homelessness.\u201cThis is the commonwealth of Massachusetts. Commonwealth. And it should be a priority [to have housing] for women with kids, old people, the infirmed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be like this. It\u2019s a crisis.\u201d",

        "body": "The other day, I was walking near a bus stop by the Common when I saw something interesting: At the bus stop, in that usual spot where you'd see an ad, there was this big, vibrant piece of art.But it wasn't actually a painting. It was a surreal photo with two women at the center painted white and wearing all black, sitting on these bright red chairs, vibrant blue and red and yellow hues behind them. There were eight other women in bright red cloaks who look like they're marching in a line behind them. Totally unlike anything you'd usually expect at a bus stop.I wanted to know why this weird and beautiful photo was here. So I called up the artist: A\u00efda Muluneh, a photographer and artist based in Abidjan, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. She\u2019s also a promoter of developing photography as an art form in Africa. The photo is part of a new public art installation in JCDecaux bus shelters in New York, Chicago, Boston and Abidjan. It's called \u201cThis is Where I Am.\u201d\u201cI have many memories of the cold winters in Canada having to take the bus to go to different places,\u201d Muluneh said. \u201cI think for a lot of people that take public transportation, it's an interesting way to engage them in looking at something outside of just advertising.\u201dMuluneh, who was born in Ethiopia and grew up in Canada and Yemen, among other places, said the public art project appealed to her because it allowed her to bring her art to more people, as opposed to having it cloistered in an institution or gallery. Her work is often colorful, carrying a distinct visual language, she said. \u201cI know I have a very distinct visual language, which took me a while to arrive to this point,\u201d she said. \u201cFor those that see my work, it's something that they don't forget because it has its own approach.\u201dShe brings her subjects onto sets she builds, and works with teams of artists to make props. \u201cI utilize a lot of my heritage, my culture. I do body painting,\u201d Muluneh said. \u201cIt's the kind of work that you'll see from quite a distance. And there's a striking element to it.\u201dThis project is the first time in her career that she\u2019s worked in a vertical format. Usually, she said, her works are square. \u201cI liked that challenge because it took me out of my comfort zone to think in the vertical,\u201d Muluneh said. \u201cTo try to imagine what I wanted to say that I've been saying within a square format, and to reformat into this different style. She and her team also enjoyed the process of making public art. \u201cIt's been really an open conversation on public art that really, I think, supports the artist's vision of what we want to say,\u201d Muluneh said. \u201cI enjoyed working with them because it's a conversation, and it's a negotiation that we have. But at the end of the day, for me, I look at intent. And the intent to me is really to bring a different form of art into the public that would not normally engage in it, and to also engage an audience that might not necessarily go into these galleries or go into these museums.\u201d",

        "body": "I was in high school when it hit me that I never wanted to have kids. Maybe that anti-maternal instinct would not seem so unusual now, or even back then in some other part of the country. But I grew up in Tennessee, where every young woman\u2019s two-step program was supposed to include marriage and family. I was all in on the Prince Charming fantasy wedding component, but not the birthing part. I kept my errant feelings to myself \u2014 ecstatic when I stumbled across a book about women choosing not to have kids. I dogeared the pages, relieved that my feelings were validated.I had great parents and I was lucky enough to have a mother I both loved and admired, and who was well loved by other kids. I should have wanted to embrace the role, but early on I told my mother I realized motherhood was a lifetime job and I didn\u2019t want the job. And I didn\u2019t change my mind later when a serious boyfriend told me not having kids was a deal breaker. You might assume that I hate kids, but no, I enjoy other people\u2019s kids. One of my friends forbade me from reading stories to his daughter because he said I was \u201craising the bar\u201d by acting out all the characters and rereading the book as many times as she wanted. And I was always the first one volunteering to rock and coo over the newborn kids of my friends. Many of those kids grew up calling me Aunt Callie. So did my real twin niece and nephew, whom I have doted on all their lives.I\u2019m recalling my experiences because recently I\u2019ve been stunned to see how much some people are invested in denigrating women who are childfree by choice. A choice that is none of their business. Chelsea Handler triggered a firestorm of misogynistic fury after a she created a satirical and raunchy sketch for Comedy Central\u2019s \"The Daily Show,\" which portrayed her exciting, carefree life as a single woman with no kids. Handler responded to the apoplectic Fox host Tucker Carlson with the question: \u201cAre you really upset about how much freedom I have, or are you upset that you haven\u2019t been able to take it away from me yet?\u201d Handler\u2019s clapback identifies this exchange for what it is: the latest outrage in the culture wars. Childfree by choice, after all, includes choice as the operative word. A 2022 study of 1,500 Michigan adults found the percentage of young people deciding early \u2014 as I did \u2014 they don\u2019t want kids has risen. What\u2019s more, the study revealed that of the estimated one in five who said no to having kids, most don\u2019t change their minds.The news is full of incidents of neglected and abused children in the custody of people who should never have had them. So, I\u2019m at a loss as to why women making a thoughtful choice not to have kids is threatening. But then again, I\u2019m at also at a loss about why the folks pushing for every woman to give birth \u2014 no matter the circumstances \u2014 are generally the last ones to fight for resources to care for those children.This Women\u2019s History Month I\u2019m saluting the women who continue to advocate for other women to make the reproductive decisions best for them: those who are wonderful mothers, and those who wisely chose not to be.",

        "body": "During the current labor shortage in Massachusetts and elsewhere, businesses who rely exclusively on online job applications are missing out on a group of people who want to work.Almost all businesses \u2014 including those paying minimum wage \u2014 require people to apply online. But not all job seekers have a computer, internet access or the digital know-how to submit an application.At a job fair at Greenfield Community College last month, 29 employers perched, ready, seated behind tables. One has five positions to fill. Another 50. One has 69 openings.With a labor shortage, people applying for jobs should be in the driver\u2019s seat. But that hasn\u2019t been the case for Jesse Morrison of Vernon, Vermont.\"It\u2019s a challenge. That\u2019s all I can say, doing the stuff online,\" Morrison said. \"Doesn\u2019t always go smooth.\"Morrison spent more than half of his 51 years driving a propane truck. He wants to work. He has a computer and internet, but got stuck \u2014 at first \u2014 uploading a job application.\"One said it had to be PDF form, when you tried to upload it. And you\u2019re like, 'What is that? What kind of paper is that?' But it kept saying it wouldn\u2019t do it because it wasn\u2019t one,\" he said.Pershing Reid from Orange also has a computer and internet \u2014 and also has trouble applying online. The 72-year-old's work experience includes driving an MBTA bus in Boston. He is looking for a job driving a van or a bus.\u201cI tried to [apply online] but I didn\u2019t get very far,\u201d Reid said. \"I went to the site ... of the company, but it just didn\u2019t tell me how to get on. Because it didn\u2019t tell how to get on, I could not apply.\"Reid even visited the company in person, but they just sent him back to their website.Another company, Mativ, a plastics manufacturer in Greenfield, has 15 open positions. According to online job postings, some include a $3,000 signing bonus. HR Business Partner Crystal Fish said if an applicant is having problems submitting an application, she\u2019d be happy to help them out.\"We haven\u2019t had anybody that\u2019s had problems applying to our website or at least not that we\u2019ve been made aware of,\" Fish said.In fact, most recruiters at the Greenfield job fair said they haven\u2019t even heard of the problem.But Maura Geary, who organized the fair, knows it well. Geary is the executive director of the MassHire Franklin Hampshire Career Center.\"Some people truly can't access the online application itself. So, they need to be walked through the online application,\" she said.The career center staff includes a digital navigator who offers job seekers three one-hour lessons on basics like setting up an email account and uploading a resume. The center also offers workshops.\"A lot of first interviews are virtual,\" Geary said. \"We do trainings to get them up to speed on all of the different workforce tools that are necessary to get a job.\"In the last couple of years, the career center has given away 592 Chromebooks. According to Geary, the state has given away 10,131 since December 2020.And if a job seeker can\u2019t afford internet access, the center will help them apply for the Federal Communication Commission\u2019s Affordable Connectivity Program, which helps pay for the service. The program will also help pay for a computer or tablet for eligible households.Compared to the rest of the state, Geary said Franklin and Hampshire Counties have more job seekers with disabilities, and slightly more who are 55 or over \u2014 some of whom face digital challenges.\"We definitely work with mature workers who face technology barriers and also some ageism, frankly, in their search for new careers.\" Geary said. Melanie Gelaznik, executive director of the MassHire Berkshire Career Center, said people come in every day looking for help applying for online jobs.\"People with a lower income and perhaps a lower education struggle more,\" Gelaznik said.Besides older adults and people with lower incomes, the digital divide disproportionately affects people with mental, developmental and intellectual disabilities or those with limited English, along with people who live in a place that lacks internet infrastructure.In western Massachusetts, according to the U.S. Census, Hampden County has the largest percentage of households without a computer.These digital barriers came to a head about three years ago, when a new verb entered the national lexicon: to Zoom.\"We were locked-in, locked-down,\" recalled Frank Robinson, vice president for public health at Baystate Health. \"If I'm having trouble connecting, what about our consumers, residents, patients? How are they connecting to services?\"Even getting a vaccine, at first, required fluency with online systems.But Robinson's concern wasn\u2019t just about patients needing medical appointments.\"How do you get food? How do you get, in those days, protective equipment? All that stuff was online. And if people weren't connected online, they were just outside any kind of protections,\" he said.He said the people most affected had experienced disparities before the pandemic.\"Black, brown [people], folks living with disabilities, older adults would be also having problems because they already experienced significant inequities,\" Robinson said.Being connected and literate in digital tools is what Robinson calls a civil right and a human right.\"If you don\u2019t have that level of proficiency, you can\u2019t fully participate in society,\" he said.In the summer of 2020, Robinson convened a meeting of concerned groups in western Massachusetts. Now 30 organizations strong, the coalition is called the Alliance for Digital Equity. It includes libraries, schools and at least one affordable housing provider.On a Tuesday night, about 10 students sit with laptops open, attending their second computer course offered by Way Finders in Holyoke. The topic that night was finances and digital tools that help people budget.Before Jose Angel Hernandez took the first course, the 58-year-old tried to submit job applications using his phone.\"First of all, I didn't have a computer,\" Hernandez said, in Spanish. \"I tried to do it on my cell phone, but it was impossible because I can\u2019t see.\"That's a common problem for job seekers whose only device is a phone. As part of the course, Way Finders gave each student a Chromebook. Hernandez is practically hugging his.\"This is mine,\" he said. \"Once they gifted it to me I was able to fill out the application and send my resume.\"After taking his first computer course last summer, Hernandez submitted a job application online and was hired by November.\"I love this job. I like to help. I love it,\" he said.He works at an office for the WIC program for Women, Infants and Children.Plus, he can shop, pay his bills, check his bank account online and have tele-health appointments with his mother\u2019s doctor. And now \u2014 he has email.Hernandez said using a computer has helped him discover the world.\"When I started to work on the computer, I realized how important it was for me. Because this opens your mind, it opens your eyes, you know, you discover the world using the computer,\" he said.His classmate, 59-year-old Grisel Monserrate, said she didn\u2019t know much about computers before taking the courses. And now?\"It makes me feel sure of myself that I can achieve many of the things that I want to,\" she said, in Spanish.Monserrate takes care of her mother, who has Alzheimers. And she started and runs a support group for other Spanish-speaking caregivers, called Cuidadores Unidos. She said her new computer skills allow her to do so much more for the group.\"It makes me happy to be able to help other people,\" Monserrate said.Way Finders is about to offer computer classes for another 80 students this year with help from the Boston-based group Tech Goes Home. The first class for older adults in Springfield starts in May.Tech Goes Home teams up with organizations like Way Finders that have already built trust in their communities and trains them to teach people, some of whom have never used a computer before.Last year, Tech Goes Home had 4,000 graduates from their training workshops, all from eastern Massachusetts.Tech Goes Home CEO Dan Noyes said age, language, income and disabilities all contribute to the digital divide.\"But what is even more nefarious is that the digital divide is a racial justice issue across almost every data point you look at,\" he said. \"There is a massive racial divide between those that have access and those that don't.\"Noyes said the need for these skills is even more critical than it was before the pandemic, because so much of life has moved online \u2014 including in the job market.\"The barriers to not only getting a job but keeping and succeeding that job are dependent a lot ways on having digital skills,\" Noyes said.In Holyoke, Monserrate said when she first came from Puerto Rico, someone told her she wouldn\u2019t achieve anything without speaking English.\"And all of this has made me feel like, 'Yes, I can. Yes, I will achieve it.' And that makes me feel happy,\" she said.Her goal: start an in-home day care for children.SeparatorThis story was originally published on New England Public Media.

        "body": "On Monday, April 17, runners from all over the world will descend on Boston to run the historic Boston Marathon from Hopkinton to Copley Square. Whether you want to tune in from home or find a spot to cheer on the athletes, here\u2019s what you need to know. Watch the marathon on televisionThe marathon will be broadcast on WCVB channel 5. Coverage starts early, at 4 a.m. and goes through the evening. It will also be streamed on WCVB\u2019s digital platforms and app. ESPN will cover the marathon from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m.Athletes leave Hopkinton in waves, beginning at 9 a.m. and through 11 a.m., so there is plenty of action all day. The lead men and women are expected to cross the finish line around 11:45 a.m. and 12:00 p.m., respectively. If you want to track someone along the route, the BAA puts out a free BAA Racing App that you can use to track their bib number as they make their way to Boston. The 2023 version will be launched sometime in April. Watch the marathon in personWatching the Boston Marathon and cheering on athletes is one of the great Boston traditions, whether you\u2019re getting up early to catch the crowds of runners as they leave Hopkinton, or joining the roaring crowds on Boylston Street to see them cross the finish line. If you\u2019ll be in the city, the MBTA is your best bet to get around. You can also take the commuter rail to spots near the route in Ashland, Framingham, Natick, Wellesley, Lansdowne and Back Bay. Check and make sure individual stations are open when it gets close to Marathon Monday: the Copley stop on the Green Line, for one, will be closed all day. Spectators should also expect to go through security checkpoints to access certain areas, like Copley Square. If you\u2019re planning on driving, make sure to check on road closures. Roads near the beginning of the route, in Hopkinton and Ashland, will be closed from around 6:15 a.m. to 1:20 p.m., while roads closer to the end of the route, like Brookline and Back Bay, will be closed from around 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. See a full list of closures and timings in the BAA Spectator Guide.Among the more popular viewing spots are the Scream Tunnel at Wellesley College, Heartbreak Hill (which culminates around mile 21 at Boston College), Beacon Street in Brookline and, of course, the finish line on Boylston Street. GBH News asked our followers the best place to watch the marathon. Here are their favorite spots:Julie says that the halfway point in Wellesley works well for anyone driving, and it\u2019s when runners can use some extra encouragement:Ian Lamont likes to watch runners as they turn onto Commonwealth Avenue and give some encouragement before they start the infamous Newton hills: Ben Horner says Brookline is a great spot for both cheering and brunch on Marathon Monday:Greg Maynard also recommends Coolidge Corner:For a festive atmosphere, check out Kenmore Square and join the thousands of students who will be cheering on the athletes:Maddie Brodeur recommends the bridge on Massachusetts Avenue, right after the runners pass through Kenmore Square:For spectators in Back Bay, the corner of Gloucester Street is a great spot to cheer runners on as they are in the home stretch:And the most inspiring spot is, of course, the finish line at Copley Square:",

        "body": "Here\u2019s what you need to know about the 127th Boston Marathon, one of the city\u2019s more-than-a-century-old traditions that brings world-class athletes, an air of excitement and standstill traffic to Greater Boston. When is the marathon? How long has it taken place?This year\u2019s Boston Marathon is on Monday, April 17, 2023.The Boston Marathon is the oldest continually run marathon in the world, and considered by many to be the most prestigious. It started in 1897 with just 18 people, and now tens of thousands of people from around the world participate each year. This year will be the 127th marathon. It is usually run on the third Monday in April, which in Massachusetts is Patriots\u2019 Day \u2014 the state holiday that commemorates the battles of Lexington and Concord during the Revolutionary War. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the marathon, and last year marked the first time in three years that the marathon was run on Patriots\u2019 Day. This year also marks the 10th anniversary of the bombing at the Boston Marathon, when explosions at the finish line killed three people and injured hundreds more. The city will commemorate the anniversary with a remembrance event and service projects for One Boston Day.What is the marathon route?The 26.2-mile route starts in Hopkinton and makes its way through suburbs, all the way to the finish line in Boston. Although it starts slightly downhill, the notorious hills around Newton make it one of the more difficult marathons for distance runners. After setting off along East Main Street in Hopkinton, runners follow Route 135 as they traverse through Ashland, Framingham, Natick and Wellesley. There, the marathon follows Route 16 and Commonwealth Avenue through the hills of Newton and up Heartbreak Hill. It turns onto Chestnut Hill Avenue through Cleveland Circle and takes Beacon Street into Brookline, then through Kenmore Square. As they come into Back Bay down Commonwealth Avenue, runners take a right on Hereford Street and a left on Boylston Street, and finally cross the finish line in Copley Square. How do runners qualify for the Boston Marathon?To run the Boston Marathon, athletes must qualify by beating a certain time at another major marathon, a time that\u2019s determined by their gender and age. That strict qualification requirement sets Boston apart from other worldwide races, many of which have lotteries for runners who don\u2019t meet qualifying times. Registration happened in September. The other way to run the marathon is as part of the charity program, which requires you to raise substantial money for a local charity: a minimum of $5,000.Who\u2019s running the Boston Marathon?This year, 30,000 runners are expected to make the journey from Hopkinton to Copley Square. The Boston Athletic Association, the nonprofit behind the race, said that this year will be the \u201cfastest and most decorated Boston Marathon across all of our divisions in race history.\u201d The Boston Marathon attracts some of the biggest global stars in running, and this year is no exception. Among the elite athletes on the men\u2019s side are: Eliud Kipchoge, a runner from Kenya who\u2019s taking on Boston for the first time after winning two Olympic gold medals for the marathon; Evans Chebet, the reigning 2022 champion from Kenya; and Benson Kipruto, the 2021 winner who is also from Kenya.In the men\u2019s wheelchair division, American Daniel Romanchuk is back to defend his title. He will be challenged by Marcel Hug, the reigning Paralympic marathon gold medalist and world-record holder.On the women\u2019s side, Desi Linden, the American who won in 2018, will be running along with previous champions Kenya\u2019s Edna Kiplagat and Ethiopia\u2019s Atsede Baysa. The women\u2019s wheelchair division field will feature Switzerland\u2019s Manuela Sch\u00e4r, who has won Boston four times; Australia\u2019s Madison de Rozario, the 2020 Paralympic gold medalist; and American Tatyana McFadden, who has won Boston five times. The Para division will feature Lisa Thompson and Liz Willis, who both won titles in their division last year. How much money do athletes win?The top 10 men and women finishers in the open division will be awarded prize money, ranging from $5,500 for those in 10th place to $150,000 for the man and woman who come in first. The top three men and women in the masters division, for runners over age 40, are awarded $1,500, $2,500 and $5,000 for third, second and first place, respectively.In the wheelchair division, the top 10 men and women finishers will also receive prizes, ranging from $750 to a top award of $25,000.This will be the third year that prize money will be awarded to the top three male and female finishers in each of the five Para Athletics Divisions for athletes with vision, upper-limb and lower-limb impairments. The top racers in each division will receive $1,500, the second-place finishers $750 and the third-place finishers $500.There are also $50,000 prizes for any athlete who sets a new course record in either the open or wheelchair divisions.What changes are being made this year?This year marks the first year that runners will be able to register as nonbinary for the in-person race, following races like Chicago and New York that have previously added that option. Athletes who register as nonbinary for the Boston Marathon will not be eligible for division prizes. \"So I think we can take this moment to celebrate, but we also have to recognize that it isn't the end, there's still so much ahead of us,\" Jake Fedorowski, the author of the \u201cThe Guide to Non-Binary Inclusion in Running,\u201d told GBH News when the policy was announced in September. \"I'm confident that Boston is committed to that work \u2026 this is just kind of one of those initial but still very important steps.\"In January, the BAA announced a new policy that will allow pregnant and postpartum runners who qualified for the marathon to defer to future years. \u201cWomen who are entered in a BAA race and want to expand their family will be able to do just that without giving up a chance to participate at a future BAA event,\u201d said Jack Fleming, the president and CEO of the BAA. Continuing its policy from last year, runners from Russia and Belarus are not allowed to enter the race under their country.How can I watch?You can watch the marathon at home by tuning into WCVB channel 5. Coverage starts at 4 a.m. and goes through the evening. It will also air on ESPN from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m.Athletes leave Hopkinton in waves, starting around 9 a.m. and through 11 a.m., so there is plenty of action all day. The lead men and women are expected to cross the finish line around 11:45 a.m. and 12:00 p.m., respectively.Spectators are encouraged to line the 26.2-mile course. Among the more popular viewing spots are the Scream Tunnel at Wellesley College, Heartbreak Hill, which culminates around mile 21 at Boston College, and of course, the finish line on Boylston Street. If you\u2019re in the city, the MBTA is the best way to get around that day. Check and make sure individual stations are open when it gets close to Marathon Monday: the Copley stop on the Green Line, for one, will be closed all day. Spectators should expect to go through security checkpoints to access certain areas, like Copley Square.If you want to track someone along the route, the BAA puts out a free BAA Racing App that you can use to track their bib number as they make their way to Boston. The 2023 version will be launched sometime in April. For more details on watching in person, check out the BAA\u2019s spectator guide.What other events will be happening that weekend? The BAA 5k will be held on the morning of Saturday, April 15, and is expected to draw 10,000 runners to downtown Boston. Runners start on Charles Street between the Public Garden and Common, and make a loop through Back Bay. April 15 also marks One Boston Day, which has been observed every year since the 2013 bombings.Keeping with tradition, the Red Sox will have a home game on April 17, against the Los Angeles Angels. The game starts at 11:10 a.m.",

        "body": "A day after the owner of a Boston-area pizzeria chain was charged with forced labor and abuse of an immigrant worker in federal court, local advocates say it\u2019s likely there are many more exploited workers in our region who go unidentified. Audrey Richardson, a managing attorney with the nonprofit Greater Boston Legal Services, said the organization is \u201cfamiliar with the case.\u201d She frequently sees similar situations of exploited workers too afraid to seek help. She said a lot of undocumented workers feel like they can\u2019t come forward because of threats of deportation and losing their livelihoods\u201c[These cases] might not rise to the level of being just so violent, and so off the charts for such a long period of time,\" Richardson told GBH News. \"But the same elements of employers who want to intimidate and threaten workers to take advantage of them and to keep them working and to not pay them what they're owed are there.\" Stavros Papantoniadis, owner of Stash\u2019s Pizza in Dorchester and Roslindale, was arrested Thursday on allegations that he physically assaulted undocumented employees, withheld wages, forced workers to work over 80 hours a week for little or no pay and threatened them with deportation. One alleged victim detailed claims of being kicked, choked and assaulted so severely that he had to have all of his teeth removed, according to a federal affidavit. He said Papantoniadis yelled Muslim slurs as he was beaten and threatened his life. The man said he worked there for nearly 14 years, partly in fear of being deported.Papantoniadis couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. He has yet to enter a plea and is being held pending a detention hearing on Monday. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison. Mohammed Missouri, executive director of Jetpac \u2014 a Cambridge-based nonprofit seeking to elect American Muslims \u2014 says the case also reflects anti-Muslim bigotry that contributes to people not seeking help. The organization refers individuals in the Muslim community who experience workplace harassment to the Council on American-Islamic Relations \u2013 Massachusetts and other advocacy and civil rights groups for resources.\u201cIf you feel like you're in a situation that can't be necessarily helped by you speaking out, you're not going to speak out,\u201d he said. This is the first case of forced labor filed by U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins\u2019 office since she took the job last year. Since then, she has created a human trafficking unit focused on sex and labor violations. Rollins called the allegations \u201chorrific\u201d in a press release on Thursday but said the problem of forced labor is widespread. \u201cLabor trafficking is real and happening every day in Massachusetts and beyond,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cWe are working hard to expose this disturbing crime and to hold those that abuse and traffic people accountable.\u201dThe problem of forced labor, often hidden in plain sight, has been the topic of an ongoing investigation by the GBH News Center for Investigative Reporting. GBH News reporters have spoken with restaurant and construction workers and domestic cleaners, among others, who have detailed working long hours for little or no pay, who are fearful of deportation, abuse and even homelessness.Audrey Richardson encouraged workers at Stash\u2019s Pizza and other businesses who think they\u2019re dealing with labor violations to reach out to Greater Boston Legal Services and community worker centers that work with immigrants. She said there have been recent efforts at the federal level to better help victims.In January, the Department of Homeland Security announced a new process that grants \u201cdeferred action\u201d for workers who are witnesses or could potentially be witnesses in a labor dispute being investigated by a government agency. The status allows immigrants to work legally and protects them from deportation. \u201cIt really does allow workers the feeling that they can come forward, that they're protected, that they will have the ability to come out of the shadows and work lawfully,\u2019\u2019 Richardson said. It is unclear if any of the alleged victims in this case accessed that new process, but according to the affidavit, Department of Homeland Security agents helped several immigrant workers at Stash\u2019s Pizza acquire immigration benefits, including \u201ccontinued presence,\u201d which allows them to remain in the U.S. legally under human trafficking laws. The Department of Homeland Security also signed a supportive document, called certification, that helps one of the victims in their application for a T-visa, which is an option for victims of forced labor and sex trafficking. Certain victims can remain in the U.S. legally for four years if the federal government grants that benefit.",

        "body": "State Auditor Diana DiZoglio said Friday that many of her former colleagues in the Massachusetts House and Senate support her controversial audit of the state Legislature, but fear that voicing their support publicly will lead to retribution.\u201cThere are a lot of legislators who actually welcome the opportunity for an audit \u2014 but understand that they may be retaliated against if they support such an effort,\u201d DiZoglio told Adam Reilly on GBH News\u2019 Talking Politics. \u201cA lot of folks have expressed to me that, you know, they might be supportive, but fear that if they do express that publicly that their district will be punished, that their community will be punished,\u201d she added. In her 2022 campaign, DiZoglio had vowed to audit the Legislature if elected, and earlier this month she followed through. On March 7, she delivered formal notifications \u2014 know as letters of engagement \u2014 to House Speaker Ron Mariano and Senate President Karen Spilka, telling them she plans to review \u201cbudgetary, hiring, spending and procurement information ... information regarding active and pending legislation, the process for appointing committees, the adoption and suspension of House and Senate rules and the policies and procedures of the House and Senate.\u201dIn a statement issued after DiZoglio\u2019s announcement, Spilka questioned both the need for DiZoglio\u2019s audit and the auditor\u2019s authority to conduct it. In her interview with GBH News Friday, DiZoglio did not directly answer a question about what her audit could reveal about the Legislature that isn\u2019t already known. Later in the interview, however, she said that \u201cinformation regarding active and pending legislation\u201d could include communications between legislative leaders and rank-and-file members about how leadership expects them to vote on certain bills.\u201cCertainly conversations could be part of an audit \u2014 conversations with staff, conversations with legislators,\u201d DiZoglio said.DiZoglio also said that, as of March 17, neither Mariano nor Spilka had directly responded to the notification letters sent to them 10 days earlier, and that no specific information has yet been requested from either chamber.Those same letters also state that, when DiZoglio does request specific information, the House and Senate will have 72 hours to provide it.If legislative leaders don\u2019t meet that expectation, DiZoglio said, she\u2019ll try to persuade them to cooperate before pursuing a legal remedy. \u201cI hope that the courts do not have to be involved in this conversation,\u201d she said. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have to be involved in this conversation. That is a path that I said I would take if necessary, but ... I\u2019m hoping that legislative leadership will come around.\u201dCritics have contended for years that the Massachusetts Legislature is opaque to a fault. Among other things, a 1997 Supreme Judicial Court decision that many consider misguided exempts the House and Senate from state public-records law, and the votes taken by House members on key committee votes are not shared with the public.Watch: DiZoglio pushes forward with legislature audit despite pushback from lawmakersTell us: Do you support DiZoglio\u2019s push to subject the Massachusetts Legislature\u2019s private workings to public scrutiny?

But now it's back with a vengeance, thanks to CNN reporting that found Warren has called Harris twice to apologize and Harris still hasn't called her back.Whether Warren intended to jab at Harris is debatable, but one thing is certain: Harris has been under scrutiny in recent months, and the portraits painted of her performance as vice president have generally been unflattering.

        "body": "Cambridge officials announced Friday the city hired an outside agency to conduct an independent review of the fatal shooting of Sayed Faisal by Cambridge police, as well as a review of what changes to police training, policies and protocols could prevent similar incidents in the future.A Cambridge police officer shot and killed Faisal on Jan. 4 after they say he approached officers with a knife. The incident has resulted in protests and multiple lengthy community meetings. In response, city officials have pledged to implement body cameras for police and look at alternative responses to 911 calls. \u201cFollowing the tragic police shooting of Arif Sayed Faisal, I have been committed to charting a path forward by working with the Police Commissioner and City department heads to evaluate our existing services and implement the six recommendations outlined by the City Council that will strengthen our overall safety and support for the Cambridge community,\u201d City Manager Yi-An Huang said in a press release announcing the move on Friday. \u201cBringing on PERF is one of several commitments we are in the process of implementing and they have a strong record on police reform and helping departments make meaningful changes.\u201dThe independent review will be conducted by a team at the Washington, D.C.-based Police Executive Research Forum that will include both law enforcement officials and civilian members, including one who specializes in officer-involved shooting investigations, according to the press release. Part of the review will involve interviews with those involved in Cambridge\u2019s emergency response, such as dispatchers and trainers. Barbara Dougan, legal director for the Massachusetts chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, was cautiously optimistic about the announcement. \u201cIt may turn out to be a good thing if they are willing to look at this beyond the confines of your traditional policing analysis. If they\u2019re willing to be visionary and explore alternative ways of responding to an incident where someone is in the throes of a mental health crisis,\u201d Dougan said. \u201cIf instead, they limit themselves to kind of the traditional analysis, they may not end up with anything that, at least from our perspective, is that much more helpful.\u201dDougan emphasized that the external review will have no effect on the judicial inquest, an independent investigation that began last month to determine whether there\u2019s probable cause that the officer who shot Faisal committed a crime. That investigation is being conducted at the request of the Middlesex district attorney's office and involves the DA's office, Massachusetts State Police detectives assigned to the DA's office and the Cambridge Police.\u201c[PERF\u2019s independent review] will help us continue to learn and grow from the January 4th fatal shooting, particularly from the lens of our policies and procedures,\u201d Police Commissioner Christine Elow said in the release. \u201cAdditionally, we expect they will help us with recommendations on less-than-lethal alternatives, how we could evolve the department and city\u2019s capacity for alternative responses to mental health crisis\u2019; and identify new or enhanced prospective training opportunities that would support safe, effective crisis response services to residents with behavioral health challenges. Ensuring that our officers and staff receive training that is consistent with national best practices will enhance the safety of our residents and officers, and help promote trust within the community.\u201dCambridge has separately allocated $3 million for the creation of a new community safety department outside of the police department, formed at the recommendation of a task force in 2021 that would be made up of peer counselors and mental health professionals to respond to some nonviolent calls that are currently handled by police. The department\u2019s interim director says they're planning to have responders from the new department begin responding to 911 calls in the fall of this year.",

        "body": "Communities across the nation are beginning the process of acknowledging the scope of the injustices done to Black people throughout their histories, and many are developing local initiatives for reparations to balance the scales of centuries of harm.The first week of Black History Month, from inside Beacon Hill\u2019s Museum of African American History, Mayor Michelle Wu unveiled the members of the city\u2019s new Task Force on Reparations, a group that will study the scale of injustices done to its Black residents throughout history and what actions could begin to repair what has been done.The task force, which comprises a multigenerational group of historians, activists and students, is planning on meeting soon to discuss their ideas on how to approach the complexity of reparatory justice. The questions they seek to explore are nuanced and the stakes are high, and as they do the meticulous work of documentation and reflection over the next year, the city will wait to look with a careful eye at their conclusions. How will the task force properly account for such a lofty history of subjugation and discrimination? How will they sufficiently repair the generational trauma caused by a legacy of enslavement and racism? This week on Basic Black, how Boston\u2019s task force will try to answer these questions about the accountability for reparations, and how other similar councils across the country are addressing the same complex issues. Callie Crossley will be joined by: George \u201cChip\u201d Greenidge, task force member, and founder and director of Greatest MINDS; Carrie Mays, task force member, and student at UMass Boston; and Traci Griffith, director of the Racial Justice Program at ACLU Massachusetts.

        "body": "Last year, a neo-Nazi hate group displayed a banner at the South Boston St. Patrick\u2019s Day Parade. This year, elected and public safety officials have tried to make sure that does not happen again. Boston City Council President Ed Flynn, who represents South Boston, joined GBH\u2019s Morning Edition co-host Paris Alston to talk about how the city is preparing for the parade. This transcript has been lightly edited. Ed Flynn: We have absolutely zero tolerance for hate groups trying to intimidate anybody. We want a parade that's safe and welcoming to all. We celebrate our differences. We celebrate our diversity. But for hate organizations to come into Boston, we have zero tolerance for them, and there's no place at all for them in this city. Paris Alston: The white supremacist group in NSC-131 made an appearance and had that banner at last year's parade. What would exactly stop someone from doing that exact same thing again? I mean, anyone could show up and display a banner. So how do you make sure that that doesn't happen? And what's going to happen if it does? Flynn: Well, I think that's the critical question you are asking. And we all support the First Amendment. But when people come in to a parade, into a public gathering, with a message of hate, a message of division and violence, that is despicable, and that's dividing people, and that is causing harm. And that's not about the First Amendment. That's about intimidating people of color, immigrant neighbors, the LGBTQ community. So certainly it's a balancing act, but as far as I'm concerned, the First Amendment doesn't apply when you are trying to intimidate people, you are trying to discriminate against people. We have seen a rise in hate crimes here in Boston, the most progressive city in the country. We have seen hate groups march through downtown Boston and through the Chinatown area, a large AAPI [Asian American and Pacific Islander] community. We also have a large LGBT community in downtown Boston. We have seen hate groups cause disruption and chaos at various hospitals, including Children's Hospital, that are assisting LGBTQ patients. We also have seen hate groups intimidating medical professionals of color at one of the prominent Boston hospitals. So it's important that we work together \u2014 not just the police, not just civil rights groups, but everyday residents of Boston. And when we see some type of demonstration beginning, or any type of intimidation, we need to call police. Let the police know about it. We also have to strengthen our civil rights units. We need to document these incidents, investigate them and educate the public. Alston: Council president, I also have to acknowledge that there has been evidence of at least some sort of divisions that are happening within the City Council throughout the past year. And of course, that has included a verbal attack that Councilor Frank Baker made on Councilor Liz Breadon, who emigrated from Northern Ireland. Now, I know we're talking about two very different things, right? But I know that people have made links between those things, and we know that what happens with our leadership in this city can sometimes be a reflection of what's going on between everyday citizens. And so what have the conversations been like among the council when we talk about how we are respecting, when we're in conversation and in discourse with one another? Flynn: Well, I think, Paris, that there has to be more civility in government, in politics. I see it on both sides that people \u2014 even good people of good will \u2014 are doing and saying things that they normally would not say. But it's about recognizing our differences, respecting each other, knowing that we're not always going to agree with each other, but we have to respect each other. And if we don't respect each other in government, residents across the city, or residents across the state, will see it. When elected officials are not acting appropriately and being disrespectful, it almost is an invitation for our citizens to act that way again. So we have to get back to the basics of treating people with respect and dignity. And that starts with us right here. Alston: So lastly, council president, we've talked about a lot of heavy stuff here, but we also have to remember that the Southie parade is meant to be a joyous occasion, right? So what are you looking forward to about this year's parade? Flynn: What I like most about the parade is we celebrate not just the contributions and sacrifices of the Irish, but also the veterans' community and our military families. I had the opportunity to serve 25 years in the United States Navy. Alston: Thank you for your service. Flynn: Yes, thank you. And in my neighborhood in South Boston, we have the highest number of men that were killed in Vietnam. It's a happy time for the parade, but it's also a time when we acknowledge the incredible sacrifices made by our military families, including our Gold Star families as well. I know they'll be at the parade and it's an opportunity to acknowledge their presence and to thank them for their incredible service and sacrifice to our country.",

        "body": "New data suggests that Massachusetts is the most expensive state for older people living alone, meaning they\u2019re more likely to face economic insecurity than older singles in any other state. Jan Mutchler, director of the Gerontology Institute at UMass Boston and creator of the Elder Index, joined GBH\u2019s All Things Considered host Arun Rath to break down the results of the study. What follows is a lightly edited transcript. Arun Rath: First, can you tell us a bit more about the Elder Index \u2014 what it is, what it measures and how it\u2019s calculated?Jan Mutchler: Of course. The Elder Index is a measurement of how much it takes for older singles and couples to live independently in their own homes. We generate a bare-bones budget. It\u2019s a very stripped-down budget, only covers housing, food, travel \u2014 and not the fun kind of travel, just getting around to the doctors and grocery store and travel expenses \u2014 medical expenses, and a small additional amount for added things like home goods and things like that. So we calculate this bare-bones lifestyle county by county for the entire United States. And we\u2019ve been doing this here at UMass Boston Gerontology for about 12 years. Rath: As we mentioned, Massachusetts ranks first in the most expensive states for older people living alone, even ahead of New York and California. Do we have a sense of why? And also could you put that in perspective for us, give us a sense of scale? Mutchler: A lot of times, in these conversations, it\u2019s helpful to think about the values for older renters in good health because many people do rent. It\u2019s also a common transition as people get older for them to move out of owned homes and into a renter situation. So looking at those numbers, the value of the Elder Index for Massachusetts singles is just over $37,000 a year. That compares to the average U.S. value of about $29,000 a year. So you\u2019re looking at $8,000 a year more being required for older singles to stay in their homes in Massachusetts. As you said, that is higher than Hawaii, New York and California \u2014 it\u2019s the highest in the country. Rath: To make an obvious point, that\u2019s a huge deal if you\u2019re living on a fixed income. Tell us a bit more about this slice of the older population we\u2019re talking about: people who are living alone. Do the demographics of this group, say the measures of race or gender, do they track with the general population? Or are they more predominantly one thing or another?Mutchler: When you\u2019re looking at the older population living alone, you are disproportionately looking at white women. That\u2019s not to say that they\u2019re all white women by any means \u2014 but essentially, women do live longer than men, so the older we\u2019re looking in the age range, the more women we\u2019re seeing relative to men. White people also have higher longevity, longer life on average, than many other race and ethnic groups. They do live longer than African American elders, for instance.However, a lot of the reasons we see a disproportionate share of white people living alone relative to other groups is that other groups \u2014 the Latinx, Black and Asian populations \u2014 are more likely to be living with their children. Many of them do live alone, but a larger share lives with other people than is the case in the white population.Rath: Do we have a sense that this group, the older people who are living alone, is growing as we have an aging population?Mutchler: Yes. Over many, many decades, we can track the growth in the percentage of older people living alone. A lot of that is a function of outliving spouses. It\u2019s also a function of many people not forming marital relationships at all. It\u2019s a function of a sort of cultural norm where independence is highly valued in many groups; a lot of people feel that they should be living alone, that that\u2019s expected, and that\u2019s a desired outcome for them. But that does create these financial problems that we\u2019re documenting with the Elder Index. It\u2019s expensive to live all by oneself and cover all of your expenses, and the older you get, the higher those expenses may be. You can experience an increase in the health care expenses as you get older, and you may require more medications, more doctor\u2019s visits and that kind of thing.Again, our report focuses largely on people who are renters. Especially in Massachusetts, but all the way across the country, the cost of renting has just spiraled and has hit older people very hard \u2014 as anyone who\u2019s renting. But it has had a huge impact on older people. Rath: What you just said makes this next question even harder, and that\u2019s: What can be done about this? I mean, this ties into things like housing prices, which are hard to deal with, and we\u2019re dealing with it in a lot of ways across the board. Are there any kinds of interventions, policies that can help alleviate these burdens for older people living alone?Mutchler: There are things that that we can do, as a society and as a state, and things that families and individuals can do. The challenge to some extent is that what we're talking about is: a lot of the people who have incomes falling below the Elder Index are people who used to be middle class. They used to be okay, but with time, as they age and have lost a spouse ... and their income really has shrunk, and they\u2019re no longer able to really cover this bare-bones budget that we calculate through the Elder Index. Some of those people will have incomes so low that they may be eligible for things like SNAP benefits, subsidies for health insurance, subsidized housing, things of that nature. Many of them will not have incomes that are low enough. They\u2019ll be too low to really support an adequate lifestyle, but they won\u2019t be low enough for some of the big programs that we\u2019re aware of. They might be eligible for other programs, like fuel assistance and other sorts of supports. Everybody \u2014 whether their income is very low, or they\u2019re just struggling in that middle place below the Elder Index but above the poverty line \u2014 can find out about programs that they might be eligible for through their senior centers. Every community in Massachusetts has a council on aging, and they can refer you to somebody who would give you information about what you might be eligible for if you\u2019re struggling.",

        "body": "Going into Arlington\u2019s Great Meadows nature preserve is a daily practice at the Waldorf School of Lexington, like the nursery school students and fourth graders who were out enjoying the wooded paths on Wednesday. Also a regular occurrence: Finding ticks, especially as the weather warms up. \u201cWe believe in kids being outdoors every day, all year round,\u201d said Marie Duprey, design and communications specialist for the Waldorf School. \u201cBecause there are ticks out there every day, even in the winter, we need to make sure parents are being aware of that.\u201dAt the Waldorf School, that means sending notices home several times a year, reminding parents to dress their children in long pants and closed-toed shoes and check for ticks every day.\u201cWe talk about things like: Carry a lint roller in your car. Because every time you take a walk \u2014 when you walk your dog, whether it\u2019s your kids, your dog, or yourself \u2014 you should roll yourself with a lint roller when you get back to your car,\u201d Duprey said. Ticks, and tick-borne illnesses, don\u2019t really take years off in Massachusetts, said Dr. Catherine Brown, the Department of Public Health\u2019s state epidemiologist. Brown said the biggest concern among several tick-borne diseases in Massachusetts is always Lyme disease, the well-known bacterial infection often carried to humans by deer ticks. There are others that are rarer or often less severe, like anaplasmosis, another bacteria, and babesiosis, a microscopic parasite that can infect red blood cells. Brown said the state typically logs several thousand Lyme cases in humans every year, which is likely an undercount. \u201cThe fact is, in Massachusetts, every year is a bad tick year,\u201d Brown said. \u201cEven last year \u2014 in a year where it was dry and the tick populations were suppressed \u2014 we still had thousands of tick-borne disease cases.\u201d Early Lyme disease symptoms can include a bull\u2019s-eye-shaped rash at the site of the tick bite, as well as flu-like symptoms including a fever, chills, aches and swollen lymph nodes. A doctor can diagnose it and prescribe antibiotics. Left untreated, Lyme disease can progress into more severe symptoms. Some people infected with babesiosis can be asymptomatic, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Others can experience what feels like a flu, with a fever, chills, aches, nausea and fatigue. It can be dangerous for people who have had their spleen removed, those who have a weakened immune system, and older adults and babies. The Meadows is also very popular with local dog owners. Pam Peifer of Lexington was out early on Wednesday, bundled up for the damp, mid-30s morning weather as she walked her dog, Daisy. \u201cWe\u2019ve checked her all winter just because it keeps her in the habit,\u201d Peifer said. \u201cAnd so after the walk, she sits and waits to be checked for ticks. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot back here,\u201d she added, \u201cand we have found one on her this season already.\u201d While ticks that carry Lyme and other rarer diseases are very common in Massachusetts and the rest of the Northeast, Brown said she did not want to dissuade people from spending time outdoors as the weather gets warmer. She suggested wearing long sleeves and long pants while it\u2019s still cool enough, preferably in light-colored fabric so ticks are easier to spot before they attach. Brown said to also do thorough tick checks on all humans and pets \u2014 and, it\u2019s always a good idea to wear tick repellent. People who find a tick embedded into their skin should carefully and promptly remove it using tweezers, a tick key or their fingers protected with a tissue or plastic bag. Be sure to get the tick\u2019s head, then call a doctor, Brown said. Peifer said she\u2019s had two tick bites in the last two years. \u201cI got antibiotics both times,\u201d Peifer said, \u201cbut one time I had to go because a piece of the tick was embedded in me, and we couldn\u2019t get it out.\u201d Brown recommended talking to a doctor after a tick bite, and that common-sense precautions can help people stay safe while ticks are out. \u201cI want people to be out enjoying the weather,\u201d she said. \u201cJust be aware of the fact that any time temperatures are above freezing, those ticks can be active.\u201d",

        "body": "Forty years ago, Julia Child told Roger Berkowitz about a delicious fish she ate that had been flash frozen on a boat in Seattle. Berkowitz, a fishmonger, was unconvinced that a frozen fish could be that good. Fast forward some 30 years, and Berkowitz, the former president and CEO of Legal Sea Foods, was at a Tazmanian oyster farm. The farmers there used nitrogen to freeze oysters, then ship them to customers in Japan. \u201cThere\u2019s no way in hell this is going to be any good,\u201d Berkowitz remembers thinking. He did a blind taste test with the farm's frozen and freshly shucked oysters, and his initial reluctance turned into marvel. \u201cI could not tell the difference.\u201d Now, Boston\u2019s seafood king has launched a new marketplace to order fresh frozen seafood and meals. Berkowitz told Boston Public Radio on Wednesday that the pandemic and rising costs influenced the creation of his seafood distributing company, Roger\u2019s Fish Co. During the pandemic, people started eating out at restaurants less often. Then as staffing shortages and rising costs of labor, supplies and utilities pushed restaurant prices upward, eating at home became the better financial deal. \u201cThe paradigm of eating out is changing,\u201d said Berkowitz. He aims to meet that change by giving people the option of high-quality New England seafood that can be shucked and slurped at home. Eliminating the additional costs of full-service restaurants helps make these products more affordable, said Berkowitz. Roger\u2019s Fish Co. delivers fresh-frozen seafood, including lobster, oysters and cod, plus prepared meals like double clam chowder (more clams than his original recipe), crab cakes and lobster pizza anywhere in the continental United States. The secret to delivering seafood at its freshest state, said Berkowitz, is a proprietary freezing process inspired by Japanese technology. It\u2019s normally expensive to freeze food with nitrogen, said Berkowitz, but the gas's ability to preserve the structure and texture of food can't be beat. Versus freezing food in a large freezer, Roger's Fish Co. sprays pressurized liquid nitrogen onto the seafood to freeze it immediately and create a thin crust of ice that protects the flavor, texture and color of the product, according to the company's website. Berkowitz began his career in seafood working at his family\u2019s fish market in Inman Square in Cambridge. While working for Legal Sea Foods, he also maintained a mail-order seafood business. But with Roger\u2019s Fish Co. he can now focus on commerce full time. \u201cFor me it was sort of getting back to something I hadn\u2019t fully consummated,\u201d he said.",

        "body": "It's an historic time for women in Massachusetts, with many of them comprising top state and local offices, including Gov. Maura Healey, Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, just to name a few. But why is it so important to have women in elected office, and what difference does their leadership make? Amanda Hunter, executive director of the Barbara Lee Family Foundation, joined GBH\u2019s Morning Edition hosts Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel to discuss. This transcript has been lightly edited. Jeremy Siegel: So what has the center's research shown about the opportunities for women who serve in elected offices and the challenges they face when they get there? Amanda Hunter: Well, one reason that my boss, Barbara Lee, started the foundation \u2014 which does nonpartisan research looking at the obstacles and opportunities women face when they seek elected office \u2014 is because she knew 25 years ago that having more women's voices at the table, and having more representation at the table in general, was going to strengthen our democracy. And that is exactly what we see both nationally and here in Massachusetts when you look at women's leadership, because women are what we call 360 degree leaders: they bring the entirety of their lived experience to the table. So when you look here in Massachusetts, if you look at our mayor of Boston, for example, Michelle Wu, coming off of the COVID-19 crisis, she had children attending Boston Public Schools. She was a stakeholder when they were trying to figure out the school bus transportation issue. And so she naturally would look at that problem very differently than maybe an older man who did not have children that were directly affected by the bus issue. Paris Alston: And to that point, I'm just thinking about the overturning of Roe v Wade last year. How is policy affected when women are in office, and when they're not at the table making those decisions? Hunter: Well, you're absolutely right, Paris. Our recent study showed that a majority of women voters, including Republicans, did think that the government should stay out of women's reproductive health decisions. That same study showed that women voters think that there should be more women in office, and they believe that women are better equipped to solve the problems that not just voters are facing, but that the country is facing. And we've seen for a number of years that generally voters believe that women are more in touch with \"kitchen table issues\" because regardless of what a woman's family looks like, Barbara always says women are the peacemakers. Women are doing the emotional labor. Women are doing a lot of the shopping. And voters internalize that. Siegel: There are a number of stereotypes and biases, many of them dangerous, that have fueled the outcomes of elections for a long time. Thinking back to the 2016 election and the aftermath of that, many people pointed to the fact that despite her qualifications for the office, Hillary Clinton was not elected in large part due to the fact that she is a woman. I'm curious: From your center, looking at people who are in office, women who are in office, how does society respond to the policies and the leadership that women have when they are elected? Do we sometimes fall into those same stereotypes in response to women who have been elected to office? Hunter: Well, Jeremy, unfortunately, voters still do. And we've found for 25 years in our research that when women run for office, voters don't assume that women are qualified. Women have to do much more. Men can simply release their resum\u00e9. Women have to really justify what they accomplished in each job. And so we just recently looked at how voters view incumbent women that are in office. And similarly, voters don't assume that incumbent women are doing a good job. So the burden is on women to overcommunicate their accomplishments when they are in office. And so much of this comes down to stereotypes, as you said. We often talk at the foundation about how a lot of voters still have what we call an \"imagination barrier\" when it comes to picturing women at the highest levels of office. And even though we've broken a lot of barriers here in Massachusetts, sometimes we still see women in leadership held to a different standard because they look different, they sound different, and they are blazing their own trail in the job. Alston: And in addition to those criticisms, I'm also thinking about the challenges they face among their colleagues when they get into office, right? Not only in terms of being undermined or discounted in many ways, but also being harassed. And thinking about our own state auditor, Diana DiZoglio, who says she was sexually harassed as a legislative aide and is opening an investigation into the nondisclosure agreements that currently exist and can keep those things hidden. So with that said, how much further do we still have to go to reach equality for these women in elected office? Hunter: We still have a long way to go. And even though we have a record number of women in elected office at all levels, both nationally at the congressional level and of course here statewide in Massachusetts, women are still largely underrepresented when you compare it to the percentage of men. In our state Legislature, women make up less than a third of the entire State House. And in a progressive state like Massachusetts, that may surprise some people. So in terms of equity, we still have a long way to go. But Auditor DiZoglio is a really great example of a woman who is bringing her lived experience to the job and addressing problems that maybe a man wouldn't think to even begin to address because her experience was so specific. And that's why it's so important to have a diversity of voices at the table. Siegel: What can and should be done to make things more equitable? And what can men who are in office do to better support their counterparts who are women or who are looking to get into office in the first place? Hunter: Well, there are so many things, Jeremy, because we see in our research all the time that voters, for example, scrutinize women's appearance, their voice, their hair, their clothing, in a way that they don't for men, a lot of times because there's a uniform of what men have worn in office for so long and women look differently. So I challenge not just men in elected office, but really all of us: When we hear our friends, our family, our colleagues making comments that sound like they have some gender bias, and racial bias in a lot of cases as well, that we challenge those comments and ask, \"Would you still say that same thing about a man?\" Because oftentimes the answer is no.",

        "body": "Thousands of employees in the Massachusetts cannabis industry received an official email last week about a major data breach: the name, home and email address, phone number and date of birth of every cannabis worker in the state had been made public in an \u201cinadvertent release of agency documents\u201d by the state\u2019s own Cannabis Control Commission. Along with the names and personal information, the dataset included a list of former employees and the specific reasons they were no longer associated with the marijuana company, including alleged violations of company policy.The state email provided little context for the leak, sparking panic and confusion across online message boards and the local cannabis community. Cannabis workers say they didn\u2019t know what the breach meant for their safety. They also didn\u2019t know that the leak leads back to an investigation into a Russian oligarch and a Belmont-based blogger now hiding in a safe house.Grant Smith Ellis has been writing about weed since 2017, primarily through an online blog with 25 paid subscribers. Earlier this month, he published a blog post that included internal communications between state commission members discussing an ongoing investigation into alleged financial ties between Massachusetts-based cannabis company Curaleaf and Roman Abramovich, a sanctioned Russian oligarch and confidante of Vladimir Putin. In response to a public records request, Smith Ellis received the internal communications and a trove of other confidential information \u2014 some 17,000 rows of cannabis employees' personal data \u2014 due to an error made by the commission. The personal data never went public and his blog post only published details relating to the internal communications between commissioners regarding the Curaleaf investigation. Two days later, Smith Ellis got an urgent call from officials at the commission, the state\u2019s 100-person cannabis regulatory agency, asking him to remove parts of the post due to \u201csafety concerns.\u201d\u201cThe tone was panic and terror,\u201d Smith Ellis told GBH News. \u201cThey asked me to take the story down due to safety concerns \u2026 they basically said that leaving this information up could put people at risk.\u201dSmith Ellis and Eric Casey, who co-authored the blog post and writes about weed on his newsletter Burn After Reading, spoke to commissioners on the call and said they couldn\u2019t get any details about the extent of a potential threat. Because \u201csafety is something that we really care about,\u201d Smith Ellis said, both writers decided to delete the entire post, though they wanted to know more. \u201cIt would be very nice to get some answers,\u201d Smith Ellis said. \u201cI think if there is a threat here to an agency of the state government, that is bigger than just those staff members in that agency, this is about the United States of America and the integrity of this republic. If it was attacked, I want to know.\u201dA commission spokesperson confirmed the conversation took place. \u201cGiven the ongoing and confidential nature of the investigation, the materials should not have been produced or distributed,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cOut of an abundance of caution, the agency also asked the requestor to eliminate any references to implicated staff communications in reporting about the records request and on social media.\u201dSmith Ellis, who lives in Belmont, went into hiding at a \u201csafe house\u201d elsewhere in the state and temporarily stopped attending classes at New England Law after his professors asked him to avoid the campus out of an abundance of caution. \u201cThe impression that I got was that there was an actionable, credible, imminent threat to the safety of commission staff,\u201d Smith Ellis said. He\u2019s not the only one who is nervous. Between the commission leaking its own data and looking into a Russian oligarch with ties to Putin, \u201csome staff are pretty freaked out,\u201d a government official with knowledge of the investigation said. \u201c[The Commission] is looking into some powerful people, and staff are asking, 'What can the commission do to protect me?' \u2026 but I don't think anything I'm seeing in this scenario justifies a retreat to a safe house.\u201dIn the context of the investigation, there are no current credible threats to the safety of Massachusetts regulators, according to the official who asked to remain anonymous to avoid retribution. \u201c[The commission] is a little fish,\u201d the official said. \u201cThere are bigger regulators, so no, [the commission] is not afraid to proceed at all.\u201dSmith Ellis agreed to delete the files off of his computer, and the commission began a review of standard operating procedures and training for public records \u201cto ensure this situation does not recur,\u201d according to a spokesperson.\u201cThis is now a series of fires on several different fronts, but at this point the best thing is to be honest,\u201d the official said. \u201cThis was a mistake. This should have never happened. This was avoidable. This was preventable. And we're going to suffer the consequences as a result.\u201dIn January, the Cannabis Control Commission became the first state agency to launch an investigation into Curaleaf, a locally based company with 146 stores in 21 states, now the largest licensed weed company in the world. Regulators are looking into whether the company and its shareholders violated state law by allegedly accepting millions of dollars in loans from sanctioned Russian billionaire Roman Ambramovich. Two of Ambramovich\u2019s companies pumped over $400 million into Curaleaf and its top shareholders between 2017 and 2021 via secret offshore accounts, according to financial records leaked on the nonprofit whistleblower website Distributed Denial of Secrets in December and first reported by Forensic News. Following the data leak, internal communications between Massachusetts regulators show concern about possible \u201cred flags'' raised by reporting on possible financial ties.\u201cThis is a matter we will need the feds to advise on before we take action. It\u2019s their guidance/sanctions,\u201d one commissioner wrote to another in an internal exchange obtained by GBH News. Commissioners agreed to focus on investigating agreements, whether ownership was disclosed at any point, and any covenants, or conditions, attached to the loans that could legally be considered \u201ccontrol\u201d over the loan agreements. Curaleaf\u2019s executive chairman Boris Jordan has repeatedly denied speculation about the company\u2019s ties to Russia. But leaked documents reveal that Ambramovich was quietly funding the company via a British Virgin Islands LLC, Cetus Investments. Ambramovich, who owned the Chelsea Football Club before he was sanctioned, was allegedly referred to by staff at the LLC as \u201cMr Blue.\u201d The football club\u2019s nickname is \u201cthe Blues.\u201d Ambramovich was sanctioned in Europe, the United Kingdom and Canada in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last year. Last summer, the U.S. government obtained a warrant to seize two private jets traced back to the oligarch, saying the billionaire violated strict sanction laws by having the planes flown to Russia without securing licenses or approval. Massachusetts law requires that cannabis companies disclose the source of their capital, including the names of anyone who might have \u201cdirect or indirect control\u201d over the company. Marijuana operators must also certify that all investments were \u201clawfully earned or obtained.\u201d Following Massachusetts, regulators in Connecticut and Vermont launched investigations into alleged financial ties between Curaleaf and Abramovich. In February, Curaleaf announced the closure of its operations in California, Colorado and Oregon \u201cas part of its continued effort to streamline its business\u201d according to a report filed with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission. Curaleaf did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement to CT Insider last month, a representative said that the company has \u201cnothing to hide, and we are disappointed that the continued misguided narrative to malign the company continues among journalistic outlets \u2014 despite the absence of any evidence supporting these false and defamatory claims.\"Smith Ellis says he plans to return home soon, and feels safer as more information comes out \u2014 but he still has questions. \u201cHow did this public records request get filled in a manner that required it to be deleted and had to be clawed back? What happened between Wednesday and Friday that led an agency of the government of Massachusetts to ask two journalists to take down a story after it had been published?\u201d Smith Ellis said. \u201cWhat scares me more than anything is the unknown.\"",

        "body": "Updated at 3:55 p.m. March 22 with details of the visa fraud charges.SeparatorThe day after a civil jury found a Malden resident liable for gruesome political violence during his tenure as mayor in Haiti, federal authorities in Massachusetts arrested him for allegedly lying about his past while applying for a green card in 2008.Jean Morose Viliena, 50, was charged with three counts of visa fraud Wednesday afternoon, according to U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins' office. The federal prosecutor alleges Viliena lied about his violent past to begin a new life in Massachusetts.\u201cThe atrocities alleged here \u2014 the extrajudicial torture, murder and attempted murder of multiple people \u2014 are hard to comprehend,\u201d said Rollins in a media statement. \u201cThat this defendant, a former Mayor in Haiti, is alleged to have personally committed or ordered the maiming, harm, humiliation or death of his adversaries and then blatantly deceived our country to seek refuge here is not only unacceptable, it is a crime.\u201dViliena, Rollins' office said, filled out a form at the U.S. Embassy Consular Office in Haiti in which he falsely responded to a standard question where he was asked if he had \u201cordered, carried out or materially assisted in extrajudicial and political killings and other acts of violence against the Haitian people.\u201d He swore to a U.S consular officer that his response was true, and the State Department approved his application. Just yesterday in the same court, three plaintiffs won a hard-fought case against Viliena. Jurors said he was responsible for the killing of the brother of one plaintiff, David Boniface, and the torture and attempted killing of the two others, Nissage Martyr and Juders Ysem\u00e9. As part of the ruling, the jury awarded the three a combined $15.5 million in damages. Viliena\u2019s attorney, Peter Haley, declined to comment on Tuesday, and couldn\u2019t be reached for comment on Wednesday. The suit is the first brought against Viliena in the United States under the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991.It was filed by the San Francisco\u2013based Center for Justice and Accountability, Morrison & Foerster LLP and Dentons US LLP, which are representing the three Haitian citizens pro bono.Many of the same allegations detailed by The Center for Justice and Accountability for plaintiffs in a 2017 complaint are now being used by Rollins\u2019 office in the immigration case against Viliena. \u201cThe Center for Justice and Accountability welcomes action by the Justice Department but, given the strong evidence of torture and other abuses presented against Viliena last week during the civil trial, CJA calls for human rights criminal charges to be brought,\u201d said Ela Matthews, a staff attorney representing the plaintiffs. She said the organization calls on the State Department, U.S. Embassy in Haiti, and Inter-American Commission of Human Rights to immediately work with the Haitian government to ensure the safety of all clients, witnesses and family members of those involved in the civil case. In the civil court filings, Viliena denied the allegations and asked Judge Allison Burroughs to throw out the case over a lack of evidence. That was denied.The lawsuit accused Viliena of killing Boniface\u2019s brother, attempting to kill Ysem\u00e9 and Martyr during a 2008 government raid on a community radio station, and burning down 36 homes in 2009. The alleged crimes occurred in Les Irois, a town in western Haiti.\u201cI have dedicated over 15 years to holding Mayor Viliena accountable for ordering the murder of my brother,\u201d Boniface said. \u201cToday\u2019s verdict brings justice to me, my family and the other families of those who have been victims of Viliena\u2019s campaign of terror. I believe justice uplifts a nation, and that\u2019s why I have continued to pursue this case for all this time.\u201dThe Torture Victim Protection Act allows civil suits to be filed in the United States against foreign officials who have committed torture or unauthorized killing, if all legal avenues have been pursued. In this case, the plaintiffs said they had filed several unsuccessful complaints in Haiti against Viliena and his allies since 2007.Viliena fled to Massachusetts in 2009, and is a lawful permanent resident. He governed Les Irois remotely until early 2010, with occasional visits to the country.Viliena was elected mayor of Les Irois as a candidate for the Haitian Democratic and Reform Movement in December 2006. The complaint says he was elected using voter fraud and violence, carried out by members of the Committee for Resistance in Grand-Anse \u2014 known in Haiti as KOREGA \u2014 a political group that uses armed individuals to gain power.In 2007, Boniface, a human rights activist, was trying to assist a neighbor who had filed a complaint against Viliena and his allies. Viliena led an armed group to his home where they killed his younger brother, 23-year-old Eclesiaste Boniface.Plaintiffs Ysem\u00e9 and Martyr also alleged Viliena and the militia raided the community radio station Martyr helped set up in his home in 2008, with financial support from the political party opposing Viliena\u2019s. A raid by local government officials, Viliena and the militia shut down the station and left Ysem\u00e9 blinded, while Nissand\u00e8re Martyr\u2019s father Nissage was attacked and later had to have his leg amputated, according to court documents.\u201cViliena personally supervised his mayoral staff and security detail and led an armed group in Les Irois aligned with Korega,\u201d alleged Rollins office. \u201cUnder Viliena\u2019s direct supervision, the Korega militia enforced Viliena\u2019s policies by various means, including by targeting political opponents in Les Irois through armed violence.\u201dThere was a criminal investigation in Haiti into the killing of Eclesiaste Boniface and the attack on the radio station; Viliena was detained and then released. He fled to Massachusetts, but continued to govern remotely, deploying militia to attack his opponents and occasionally returned for brief trips.During one such trip, Viliena\u2019s associates burned 36 homes in Les Irois, the plaintiffs alleged. The jury did not find Viliena liable for that arson.After the verdict was read on Tuesday, the plaintiffs stood proudly outside the federal courthouse in Boston\u2019s Seaport around a plaque describing justice.When Nissage Martyr died under \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d the day after the lawsuit was filed in Boston, his son Nissand\u00e8re Martyr took his father\u2019s place as a plaintiff in 2017.\u201cThough I lost my father in 2017, I know if he were still living, he would be proud that I stepped into his shoes and continued the case with the other victims. We have pursued Viliena despite many obstacles. And despite his continued denials, today we received a positive verdict,\u201d said Nissand\u00e8re Martyr on Tuesday. The ruling gives a sense of justice to the plaintiffs, but they\u2019re worried about what awaits them at home, and about retribution toward their families from Viliena\u2019s associates there.Before and during the trial, courts have issued multiple protective orders after plaintiff attorneys were alerted to threats that were being made against family members and witnesses who testified in the case, and showed images of that to the judge. \u201cWhen Jean Morose and his people came to kill me, they killed my brother Eclesiaste instead. So I'm very fearful for my people that are still in Haiti,\u201d Boniface told GBH News. \u201cGod protects them. And we also have an order from the court to protect them for people that have been threatened.\u201dOn Wednesday, Ysem\u00e9 said he was \u201cexcited\u201d about the result from the U.S. justice system but he\u2019s asked his family to go into hiding, expressing concern for his wife and children. Martyr is happy, but worried about his mother and sisters in Haiti. \u201dPreviously his [Viliena\u2019s] associates in Les Irois have said that if Jean Morose Viliena is arrested, what they have done before will be nothing compared to what they will do now. They said they will burn the city of Les Irois and the families of the people who sought justice,\u201d he said. \u201cFor that reason I don't feel well.\"If the charges filed against him from Rollins\u2019 office are found valid, Vilieana could face up to 30 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a fine of up to $250,000. Rollins said gaining lawful entry into the country is a \u201cprivilege, not a right,\u201d and that people who perpetrate \u201cacts of violence and harm, and then allegedly lie about their conduct to US immigration officials \u2014 in their countries are not welcome here.\u201d",

        "body": "At GBH, we've had the pleasure of speaking with all kinds of leaders, change-makers and innovators in our community. We get to challenge our elected leaders and speak with seasoned experts \u2014 all of which are abundant in the Greater Boston area. But one thing we've never done is interview someone in space. So we jumped at the opportunity to speak with Cohasset native Stephen Bowen. He\u2019s the commander for NASA's SpaceX Crew-6 who\u2019s been at the International Space Station with three other crew members for a few weeks now. He spoke with GBH\u2019s All Things Considered host Arun Rath about life at the International Space Station. What follows is a lightly edited transcript. Arun Rath: The first question I have to ask you is: tell me what you\u2019re seeing right now. Or if you\u2019re not at a window, what would you be seeing right now?Stephen Bowen: Right now, I think we\u2019re heading out over the Atlantic Ocean. We just passed over South America and are heading up toward the African coast on a 51.6-degree inclination. If you watch a satellite map, we\u2019re heading up from South America to Africa. Rath: You\u2019re up there with your new crew. Do you feel like you\u2019re settled yet? Bowen: Not yet. It\u2019s funny because my longest previous mission was about 16 days, so we\u2019ve already passed that. You know, we\u2019re starting to get settled in, and we feel like we kind of know what we\u2019re doing, but we\u2019re not really comfortable. Some of the guys who\u2019ve been here obviously a lot longer than us, so it takes about a month to six weeks or so before you really feel like this is somewhat normal. Conversely, it takes about that long when you get back to Earth to feel like Earth is normal. Rath: When you get up there with a new crew, do you have overlap with the existing crew? How does that work? Bowen: Yeah. When we got up here, Crew-5 was still on board, so those four crew members and us four, and then three on the Soyuz [spacecraft]. So we had 11 people up here, which \u2014 even though the station\u2019s pretty big, it\u2019s an operating lab \u2014 the actual habitable volume in the places where people live is relatively small, so it seems crowded.When Crew-5 left a week or so ago, it seemed a lot emptier. They were incredibly helpful during our turnover and explainimg how things operate and how things work, which was great to have. We try to shoot for that. When we get some of that turnover, the learning curve is a lot [less steep] if you\u2019re able to pass on your knowledge. Rath: I want to ask you a bit about your background. I\u2019m wondering if when you\u2019re looking out that window, if you see Massachusetts, do you ever think about that kid growing up in Cohasset, and did he ever dream of going to space?Bowen: Yeah, actually, I have done that! When I was very young \u2014 I\u2019m old enough to have watched as we first stepped foot on the moon \u2014 I remember watching that on a black-and-white TV in our house in Cohasset. So the concept of becoming an astronaut was just sort of fantastic to me. I never really set it out as a career goal, but I just kind of went along, studied as hard as I could and always took the opportunities I could to learn more. On the path I took, I ended up as an officer in the Nuclear Submarine Corps. I applied from there, and I was fortunate enough to get selected. So it was a dream from when I was a little kid, but it wasn\u2019t something I planned on during my early-adult career. But it\u2019s been a fantastic 23 years so far, and it\u2019s pretty amazing.Rath: Like those classic Apollo astronauts that you were watching on TV, you followed the Navy route.Bowen: Yes, I did. When I talk to students, I kind of emphasize the fact that what you do in high school, etcetera, if you\u2019re having difficulty in a class or something, spend a little extra time and focus on that so you can bring your grades up and learn. Because the teachers are teaching us this stuff for a reason, so I kind of got that attitude fairly early on because I was not a good reader at first. By the time I got to be a senior in high school, I got to choose where I wanted to go to school, and the U.S. Naval Academy seemed like a great engineering school, so I went there. And it was the same thing there \u2014 I did well enough that I was able to select the Submarine Corps upon graduation. I continued to work. When you do that, you get to choose the opportunities you have, and it\u2019s pretty exciting. It led me to the opportunity to apply to become an astronaut, which isn\u2019t like that because there are so many qualified people. I felt like I won the lottery when I got selected.Rath: Well, you must have done well since then because you\u2019re now commanding this mission. Is this your first mission as a commander? Bowen: Yes, my three previous missions were all shuttle missions. I basically came up to the International Space Station as a construction worker, as a contractor, helping build the International Space Station. So I have the opportunity now to live in this house, and it\u2019s pretty amazing.Rath: Tell us a bit more about your mission. First off, the team that you\u2019re leading is an international team.Bowen: Yeah, this is an amazing group. We\u2019ve got three Russian cosmonauts on board. We brought one of them up with us on the SpaceX Dragon, and we have a United Arab Emirates astronaut, as well, on his first long-duration flight from the Emirates. It\u2019s really exciting to have such a diverse group of people on board.Rath: Tell us about what your goals are and what you hope to accomplish on this.Bowen: Well, it is a national laboratory, so there are several hundred experiments going on all around us pretty much at all times. Some of them run pretty much autonomously, a lot of them require our input \u2014 our activity \u2014 to help keep them going. ... There\u2019s a lot of sampling and just maintaining the stations.But really, what we\u2019re doing is continuing the operation of this laboratory, this incredible asset for science that\u2019s been manned since October of 2000. So almost 23 years now, we\u2019ve had people permanently living in space. That\u2019s pretty exciting in and of itself. But the research is really the goal.Rath: With all of that, it sounds like the work could never stop. How does your typical day go on the International Space Station?Bowen: Well, there\u2019s a couple of things that are really important. They want to make sure you get enough sleep, so they do schedule a block of time for sleep. You want to get about eight hours if you can. That\u2019s hard on the ground, and it\u2019s hard up here. You also have to work out and do load-bearing exercises for two hours every day to ensure that you maintain your bone density and muscle mass. You have to find time to eat and take care of all of those other issues that go along with living, so you end up with about 8- to 10-hour workdays scheduled over 12 hours because you can\u2019t put things right on top of each other. So it\u2019s a long day, and sometimes you do end up working weekends, which is good \u2014 you\u2019re always doing something useful and exciting.If you get a chance to look at our schedule, you can see what we do on a daily basis. You\u2019ll see we don\u2019t get a whole lot of spare time, which is why it\u2019s so important to get weekends and get that opportunity for some downtime to recover, to continue the pace.Rath: Your crew went up on the International Space Station on a SpaceX spacecraft. Tell me about that, how it\u2019s been learning to use new hardware like that. Bowen: Oh, it\u2019s so different because I grew up on the space shuttle. When I got the astronaut office, I did three shuttle flights, and I was the flight engineer for my first flight. We had hundreds of switches and circuit breakers and dials and knobs and displays that really required some manual intervention at different points in order to make things happen. The Dragon spacecraft is almost entirely automated, so in reality, we\u2019re monitoring systems. Our input, our interface is not those switches and circuit breakers \u2014 it\u2019s a touch screen. So it\u2019s incredibly different, an incredibly capable machine, and it\u2019s doing its job well for us so far.Rath: Will you use the Dragon capsule to get home, or does the outgoing crew use that?Bowen: We\u2019ll use our own capsule heading home in about six months or so. You splash down in the ocean, similar to the way they did in the Apollo days. And that\u2019s because the weather constraints are pretty tight, so that\u2019s one reason Crew-5 was here for a few extra days with us. You\u2019ve gotta make sure the weather\u2019s safe to come home, and that\u2019s how we\u2019ll be getting home in about five or six months.Rath: Speaking of new hardware, I have to imagine this is a pretty exciting time to be an astronaut with the coming plans from NASA. There are going to be additional moon missions. So as someone who grew up watching those Apollo missions, tell me what it feels like.Bowen: It\u2019s been incredibly exciting, and it\u2019s been getting more and more exciting over the past half decade or so. Once the Artemis Mission started to become more realistic, commercial crew came online and brought that other set of vehicles and commercial crew vehicles. We\u2019ve got SpaceX; hopefully, we\u2019ll get Boeing up here soon. That\u2019s incredibly exciting, incredibly amazing to see. And now, with Artemis and Gateway and potential missions to the moon, it\u2019s absolutely amazing. I have friends that have been at NASA a lot longer than me, and they will tell you that this is the most exciting time they\u2019ve ever had at NASA.Rath: Is there a kind of dissonance or a real contrast when you\u2019re docking the Dragon spacecraft at the International Space Station, which has now been manned for over 20 years now. Bowen: It\u2019s pretty amazing. I came through the hatch, and it looks familiar to when I left it 10, 12 years ago. But it\u2019s just so much busier. Having that extra crew member that the Dragon capsule provides just adds that much more capability to the laboratory itself, and it\u2019s really exciting. It\u2019s an incredibly bustling place, and that\u2019s great to see. Rath: Stephen, our time has just flown by \u2014 you can probably tell how much I\u2019m loving talking to you about all of this. Before we have to let you go, is there anything you want to say to your friends and family back here on Earth and in Massachusetts?Bowen: I\u2019d like to say hello! I\u2019m really enjoying the weather up here. I know the weather down there has been tough at times these past few months. I guess it was cold and dreary yesterday. I\u2019m looking forward to getting home in the fall time frame. After we get back to Houston and I get some recovery, I\u2019m probably going to head back up to New England and head up to see family in Boston. So it\u2019s going to be exciting. And, you know, maybe we\u2019ll have an NBA and NHL championship to celebrate, as well.",

        "body": "Updated March 21 at 6:17 p.m.Residents of the South Coast are bracing for the loss of their only bus service to Boston. DATTCO, the company that operates the routes, has announced it is going to shut down its bus line on April 16, which brings riders from Fall River, New Bedford, Fairhaven, Dartmouth and Taunton to South Station and Copley Square. \u201cThis is a decision we have struggled with for several months as we looked at options to both reduce our operating costs and increase fares substantially,\u201d DATTCO wrote in a statement Friday. \u201cUnfortunately, we have not found a solution that would provide a cost-effective commute option while overcoming the deficit we have been experiencing for several years.\u201d While local officials are hoping for a stopgap in service before the new South Coast Commuter Rail starts late this year, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation says it doesn\u2019t have the money to support the bus. \u201cAs much as MassDOT would like to see the commuter service continue, it does not have an existing funding source to support these service operations and is unable to provide any assistance at this time,\u201d MassDOT\u2019s Judith Riley told GBH News in a statement Tuesday evening. According to MassDOT, 30 to 60 riders take the bus every day. New Bedford state Rep. Antonio Cabral said he was shocked to learn that the service was being terminated from a constituent \u2014 and not from DATTCO or the Massachusetts Department of Transportation. \u201cThis is very important for my constituency,\u201d Cabral said. \u201cObviously, this is the only way they can commute to Boston if they can\u2019t get up there with their own car. It doesn't make sense. Right now, we have no alternative.\u201d The new South Coast Commuter Rail service will serve New Bedford and Fall River, but officials want assurance that there will be an alternative until then for those who can\u2019t, or don\u2019t want to, drive to Boston. New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell said he was \u201ctroubled\u201d by DATTCO\u2019s decision to cancel service altogether, and with little warning, in a statement Tuesday. \u201cResidents are now scrambling for alternate transit options,\u201d he said. \u201cEqually inexcusable is DATTCO\u2019s lack of any engagement with the City, which would have been open to discussions regarding the possible takeover of affected routes by another carrier in a way that provides for a seamless transition.\u201d Mitchell says he has reached out to Massachusetts\u2019 Transportation Secretary Gina Fiandaca to find a solution. Update: This story was updated to include a response from MassDOT.",

        "body": "Everett\u2019s school superintendent and her deputy seek damages against the mayor and school committee members claiming \u201cblatant and overt acts of discrimination and retaliation.\u201dSuperintendent Priya Tahiliani and Kim Tsai, her deputy, filed a lawsuit against Mayor Carlo DeMaria in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts on Tuesday, accusing him of racism, retaliatory attacks and interfering with their work as they attempted to diversify the school district\u2019s leadership. The civil complaint also lists the city of Everett and Everett\u2019s school committee as defendants. The complaint says once Tahiliani and Tsai, both women of color, began to hire non-white applicants in a school district where \u201c100%\u201d of district level jobs had been white, the mayor and school committee members subjected Tahiliani and Tsai to \u201cdemeaning and racist comments\u201d and \u201cdiscriminatory and retaliatory attacks.\u201d\u201cTheir main offense?\u201d the complaint says, \u201cBeing women of color who refused to maintain a \u2018Whites only\u2019 hiring policy for district level jobs.\u201dIn Everett\u2019s school district, more than 80% of students are of color, but the teaching staff is nearly 90% white. Tahiliani and Tsai are the first people of color to head Everett\u2019s school district. A spokesperson for the mayor, Erin Deveney, told GBH News \u201cthe City of Everett does not comment on pending legal matters.\u201d Tahiliani referred questions to her lawyer, who didn\u2019t respond to GBH News by the time of publishing.The complaint alleges that during DeMaria\u2019s re-election campaign in 2021, the mayor told members of the school committee and school employees that they needed to \u201cget [Tahiliani] out\u201d and threatened staff to \u201cremember what team [they] are on.\u201d According to the complaint, \u201cthe institutional racism championed by EverettMayor Carlo DeMaria and his cronies for the School Committee was and still is palpable.\u201dDespite generally positive appraisals for her work and the award of a statewide prize in 2022 from the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents, on March 6 superintendent Tahiliani was denied a contract renewal in a vote by the school committee that includes the mayor. The mayor did not publicly explain his opposition to Tahiliani. Days after that vote, Everett high school students walked out of school and protested in front of City Hall. Tahiliani\u2019s current contract ends in March 2024. Both Tahiliani and Tsai had filed separate complaints in 2022 with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, a necessary legal step before advancing to court. After Tahiliani filed her complaint in January, surveillance cameras were found in the ceiling of her office, and the complaint says, were removed by the FBI and are under investigation. The city is also the focus of an ongoing discrimination investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice.",

        "body": "Evictions in Boston have spiked since last year. The number of evictions filed each week in Boston are up nearly 75% from last year, according to new data released by Princeton University\u2019s Eviction Lab, looking at the four-week average. Advocates and attorneys say eviction rates are coming back up after a lull during the pandemic, saying it\u2019s been a decades-long problem exacerbated by a cost-of-living crisis. Daniel Grubbs-Donovan, a research specialist at the Eviction Lab, says the increase is partly due to federal and local eviction moratoriums being lifted. Massachusetts\u2019 statewide moratorium ended in October 2020. \u201cThe federal interventions were very effective at keeping people in their homes during the pandemic and preventing evictions,\u201d Grubbs-Donovan said. \u201cSo, in most states, in March 2020, you see eviction filings drop to zero. ... Now in a lot of states, we\u2019re seeing a return to what we call a pre-pandemic normal.\u201dBoston has seen the 11th-highest rise out of the 34 cities the lab tracks, according to Grubbs-Donovan. David Owens, an attorney who represents both landlords and tenants with the firm Hemingway & Owens, LLC, says that he\u2019s not surprised to hear evictions have risen so dramatically, particularly because they were so low at the height of the pandemic. \u201c[What] we\u2019re seeing right now isn\u2019t an overall trend increase so much as a rebound to where it was before,\u201d Owens said.Owens cited a number of reasons for the recent increase besides moratoriums being lifted, including a lack of relief funds, more restrictive tenant programs, and a backup in the court system, which he says had halted cases that are now being pursued again. He says many of the cases now were likely delayed in the last couple of years, with waits in the courts dragging cases out from two or three months to much longer. Gabrielle Ren\u00e9, a community organizer with the local housing advocacy group at City Life/Vida Urbana, says that while evictions have risen lately, they've been an issue for working-class Bostonians for decades due to the city's increasing cost of living. \u201cThis situation has been going on for many years... I would say at least [since] 1994, when the opportunity for rent control in Massachusetts was lifted,\u201d she said, referring to the 1994 ballot question that banned rent control initiatives across the commonwealth. \u201cBecause of that, families been having to deal with speculative investors coming into the communities, buying up properties and pushing them out to displacement.\u201dRen\u00e9 pointed out that Black and brown communities have been the most heavily impacted by evictions, with neighborhoods such as Mattapan, Dorchester, Roxbury and East Boston bearing the brunt of them. In particular, she\u2019s seen some of society's most marginalized \u2014 such as the elderly, people on fixed incomes and immigrants without legal authorization \u2014 dealing with evictions from the increased cost of living. Any analysis of eviction data doesn't include informal evictions, which Ren\u00e9 says is much more common among undocumented tenants. \u201cWhen you look at the census or reports, you're not going to see East Boston as being very impacted,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can only imagine people already deal with legal issues or immigration issues and then they get an eviction and they're afraid. The fear of creating additional problems for the family typically results in them picking up and leaving,\u201d Ren\u00e9 says she sees hope in Mayor Michelle Wu's recent rent control proposal, which was approved by City Council earlier this month. Rent increases would be capped at 10%, at most, each year. The proposal still needs approval from the state Legislature and Gov. Maura Healey. \u201cRent control, social housing, [we need] anything that could help families stay in their homes and stay in their communities. Housing is a human right and we ought to make a big push for that so that we can stop this madness of mass eviction and mass displacement of communities.\u201d",

        "body": "Last week, federal prosecutors charged the owner of a chain of Boston area pizzerias, Stavros Papantoniadis, with the crime of forced labor. He allegedly targeted people without immigration status to work extensive hours in his restaurants for shoddy pay and under abusive conditions. He appeared in federal court yesterday for a probable cause and detention hearing, and the judge has yet to rule on whether he'll be released on bail. GBH News legal analyst and Northeastern law professor Daniel Medwed joined Morning Edition hosts Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel to talk more about these allegations, the definition of forced labor under federal law, and why it took so long to break this case in the first place. This transcript has been lightly edited. Jeremy Siegel: Tell us about Papantoniadis and the allegations against him. Daniel Medwed: He's the owner of Stash's Pizza, which is a local chain of restaurants with current outposts in Roslindale and Dorchester. And he previously owned five different pizza shops spread across the commonwealth. Now, according to the U.S. attorney's office, over a period of many years, he forced non-citizens to work excessive hours in his restaurants, often without breaks and without overtime compensation, and he routinely threatened to alert immigration authorities about their status if they failed to comply with his outrageous workplace demands. There are even allegations that he resorted to force to keep workers in line. Apparently, seven former workers have come forward. They haven't been identified by name. One of them, listed only as \"Victim 1,\" allegedly worked there from 2001 to 2015 and claims that during that period, the owner belittled his Muslim faith, kicked him, shoved him, at one point broke his teeth so that he now has to wear dentures. Reading these charging documents, it's a remarkably harrowing and disturbing account of what may have happened there. Paris Alston: It is really disturbing, Daniel. I mean, just reading through the affidavit, there's so many details in there, some of which we cannot talk about on air because they are so terrible. And one thing that jumps out from what you said is that Victim 1 worked there for 14 years. And some may be wondering, well, why wouldn't they just leave and go find another job, especially if they're being subjected to something like that? And I can understand why that victim may have been reluctant to come forward. But do you have a sense of whether the owner here was on law enforcement's radar screen before now? Medwed: I think there were indications over the years, Paris, of problems brewing at these restaurants. So for one thing, six years ago, the Department of Labor launched a lawsuit against the owners for withheld wages and falsifying time records. That resulted in a court-ordered injunction designed to halt these practices. And in fact, federal investigators apparently went on-site to warn workers about their rights under this injunction. And the case was resolved when the owners were ordered to pay $300,000 in back wages. For another thing at the state level, our Massachusetts attorney general's office has a unit that fields complaints in this area, and apparently has received three workplace complaints about these restaurants in recent years. So I think it's fair to say that the owner here was on law enforcement's radar screen. But what probably converted this case from just being on the radar screen to going into a court setting was that several brave former workers came forward and were willing to put their stories into the official record. Siegel: Daniel, let's look at the specific charge here. What is the crime of forced labor, and what kind of punishment could he potentially be facing? Medwed: So he's being charged under a very specific federal statute. It's known as 18 U.S. Code Section 1589, which makes it a felony for someone to knowingly force another person into labor through force or the threat of force, or through the abuse or the threat of abusing the legal process. That's a lot of legalese. But at bottom, the defendant is being accused of forcibly making non-citizens work at his restaurants and essentially abusing or threatening to abuse the immigration process to exert control over them. Now, if he's convicted at the high end, he's looking at a potential sentence of 20 years in prison. That's the maximum sentence here. Alston: And I know as a result of his court appearance yesterday, it's possible that he could be facing other charges related to the way he managed his business. And, you know, Daniel, I was telling Jeremy last week that one of the Stash's, in Dorchester, is not that far from my house. I've been there a couple of times. And it wasn't in this time period, but looking back, I'm like, wow, I mean, how would anyone have known, right? And it points to this bigger question of how prevalent this is in the Boston area. Do you think that this happens way more often than we think? Medwed: Regrettably, I think it does. All signs indicate that forced labor is around us, and it's often very hard to detect, as you point out. So, for instance, I looked at some statistics from the International Labor Organization, which as of 2016 estimated that there were 24.9 million people embroiled in forced labor across the world. Many people here in the United States, often in the domestic work sector. Locally in Boston, workers' rights advocates report that stories like this are all too common. They hear this all the time. But of course, one of the major stumbling blocks is that the victims here are reluctant to come forward for fear of potential immigration repercussions. Siegel: How realistic are those fears? What rights, if any, do undocumented immigrants have in the workplace in these situations? Is there any type of whistleblower protection available? Medwed: Yes. So all workers have rights, both federally and in Massachusetts, including people without proper immigration documents. And the Biden administration in particular is making major strides in this direction to incentivize harmed workers into coming forward in scenarios like this. In January, the Department of Homeland Security launched a new program that creates a streamlined procedure for people to get what's called a two-year deferred action on any removal or deportation proceeding if they happen to be a witness in a workplace dispute or the victim of some type of workplace injury like this. So you can get two years of deferral on your immigration proceeding, possibly renew that for even longer. And during that period, you can get a work authorization permit. So the hope is that by having this relatively easy-to-access deferred action program, it will encourage or motivate people to come forward. Here in Massachusetts, we also have some great advocates that the Massachusetts attorney general's office under Andrea Campbell is making this a priority. We have tremendous nonprofit organizations, including Greater Boston Legal Services, that are there to help. So there are resources and there are protections. Alston: And we should mention, if folks may suspect that this is happening in their community, they can reach out to the attorney general's fair labor hotline at 617-727-3465. That's GBH News legal analyst and Northeastern law professor Daniel Medwed Thanks so much. Medwed: Thank you both.",

        "body": "Spring is here, which means farm workers at the Haley House Thornton Street Urban Farm and Community Gardens are looking at seeds. \u201cIt is the first day of spring, and we are plotting and planning what we're going to be growing this season,\u201d said Jay Vilar, program director at the Haley House. \u201cA lot of the work that we're doing now is about just getting ready for the season. So we're doing a lot of our seed ordering. We're doing our starts at the Dudley Greenhouse and we're starting to get our deliveries of soil and compost ready to go.\"Haley House uses its Roxbury farm to provide both food and education, Vilar said. The nonprofit runs a cafe, soup kitchen and other initiatives that connect food and community. The three-quarter acre farm grows fresh produce and allows students and neighbors to tend to the soil. \u201cWhat we're really waiting for before we can actually, truly get into the ground, is make sure there's no more frost this season,\u201d Vilar said. Right now, seeds that will eventually become kale, collard greens and tomatoes are getting their start at the Dudley Greenhouse on Brook Avenue in Roxbury. \u201cIn order for your crop to get a head start, a lot of the initial work is just about getting them ready,\u201d he said. Most produce won\u2019t go into the ground until mid-May, Vilar said. \u201cTypically when you start to put things into the ground and it\u2019s safe is around Mother's Day, that second weekend of May when you know that the weather has officially turned and you're able to grow things in the ground and everything can survive,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are things that you can start early on \u2014 like peas \u2014 that can live and germinate as the temperature is still a little cooler.\u201d Some plants, like tomatoes, will only give one harvest this year. Others, like spinach, arugula and other leafy greens, may yield two harvests if the growing season is long enough. That all depends on when the first frosts come next fall, Vilar said. The food that Haley House grows will eventually go to local seniors, the nonprofit's soup kitchen, a nutritional cooking program called Take Back the Kitchen, and to re-entry programs for returning citizens. Flowers and ornamental plants, too, will soon be ready to plant \u2014 but not quite yet. Mark Saidnawey, who with his niece Laynie Saidnawey are third- and fourth-generation owners of Pemberton Garden Services in Cambridge and Belmont, said now\u2019s the time to get everything but the plants ready to go. \u201cWe\u2019re itching to get outside,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are outside working now, putting all of our non-living items out for sale \u2014 all the pottery and all the gardening supplies and soils and compost \u2014 so we can just press a button and say 'Bring us plants,' and we're ready to go.\u201dThough most people in the Boston area will start seeing daytime highs around 50 this week, Saidnawey advised against planting flowers until nighttime lows rise above freezing. People who want a bit of color outside their homes can put flower pots outdoors, so long as they remember to bring them back inside at night to protect from the cold. \u201cI appreciate that it's the first day of spring, but we go by what the weather forecast is: low temps, high temps, precipitation,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will be the week that we'll start to bring in our early spring plants. We'll get some pansies and other cold crop flowers they can maybe take below freezing. But it's still early. You got to be careful.\u201dMost local nurseries will soon begin to sell bulbs \u2014 tulips, daffodils and hyacinths, to name a few \u2014 that will be ready to go into the ground. \u201cPansies are usually the first flowering outdoor plant to come in and safe enough to put outside, because they can take temperatures in the 20s,\u201d Saidnawey said. \u201cThey'll get a little beat up at night, but they'll bounce back as soon as it warms up above freezing.\u201dPerennials can go in the ground in the coming weeks too, he said: \u201cHellebore is a very popular early spring plant that you'll see starting to bloom in people's gardens soon.\u201dTrees and shrubs native to New England can go in during the first week of April, he said. By the middle of April, it\u2019s time for cold crop vegetables, like parsley and lettuce.\u201cBy the third week in April, we have most everything for the season, but we also have to just keep an eye on those temperatures,\u201d he said. It's also time to think about humane ways to keep bunnies and other critters from nibbling at gardens. \u201cIf you're like us and our gardening clients, the rabbits are going crazy eating the foliage of tulips and other crocus,\u201d Saidnawey said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a good time to put down some type of rabbit repellent, and you can pick that up at your local garden center. Maybe you can go online and find a little home remedy to make.\u201d People without outdoor space can also get started on container gardens, he said. Leftover containers from last season are still just fine, Saidnawey said. They may need some fresh soil, a bit of compost and new plants.\u201cOne of the greatest joys is to watch people walk into this place with a smile on their face,\u201d Saidnawey said. \u201cI mean, if you're walking into a plant store without a smile on your face, something's wrong.\u201d",

Both of them were 17, right out of training, he said. \u201cIt's just a reminder of just how amazingly young our troops are, so many of them, and we put so many burdens on their shoulders,\u201d Moulton said. \u201cThat's what we do every time we go to war.\u201dTwo decades later Moulton, who served four tours in Iraq before being elected to Congress, said he has many takeaways and complicated feelings about the invasion. An estimated 275,000 to 306,000 Iraqi civilians died in violence related to the war between 2003 and 2019, according to data from the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at Brown University. More than 16,000 Iraqi troops and 4,431 US troops were also killed. \u201cI think there was some real flawed decision-making when it came to the decision to invade in the first place,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Iraqis were thrilled that we had rid them of this tyrant of a dictator. But then in the next phase, we failed to dedicate the resources and the smart decision-making to actually reconstruct the country and build a democracy. There were bright moments of success, but also many a failure.\u201dMoulton said he believes the initial military invasion went well, but that the U.S. military withdrew too quickly under former President Barack Obama. \u201cBut on the other hand, the surge was actually successful at restoring order to the country. It was a good example of how counterinsurgencies can actually succeed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's a complicated history, and I think that's exactly what veterans today feel. We have complicated views of the war.\u201d Moulton did not go to Iraq planning a political career, he said. \u201cThis was the furthest thing from my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn't something I studied in school. It wasn't something I was interested in. But over the course of those four tours, I felt like I had seen some of the consequences of failed leadership in Washington. And in fact, there was even a day when a corporal in my platoon came up to me \u2014 it was the end of a rather difficult day \u2014 and he said, \u2018You know, sir, you ought to run for Congress someday so that this stuff doesn't happen again.\u2019\"Two decades after the invasion, Moulton said the U.S. is not serving the veterans who have returned from Iraq. \u201cThere are a lot of veterans who are homeless, who don't have opportunities back here, who literally risked their lives for the country but don't have the opportunities that many other Americans do,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a lot more that we need to do. But it's encouraging that the Congress is working in a bipartisan way to get this done. It's one of the few places where you see Democrats and Republicans coming together on both sides of the aisle.\u201dDecisions to send U.S. troops to war should be made with great care, Moulton said. \u201cI think the most important thing is we have to make these decisions very carefully, and they shouldn't be politicized,\u201d he said. \u201cThere's a lot of people playing politics right now with the war in Ukraine. You got Tucker Carlson, Marjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right extremists essentially spouting Kremlin talking points. You've got other people who are just flying their Ukrainian flags without much idea of what that means or what's going on on the ground.\u201dThat brings him back to his 24-year-old self, and the two 17-year-olds who joined his platoon on the eve of the invasion. \u201cThe point I bring this back to is that when you fight a war, a lot of people die and they're very young,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think that remembering the people who are involved in war is one of the most important things that we can do.\u201d",

        "body": "A Malden resident was held liable in Boston federal court on Tuesday for gruesome political violence waged against three plaintiffs during his time as mayor of a town in Haiti. Jurors said Jean Morose Viliena was responsible for the killing of the brother of one plaintiff, David Boniface, and the torture and attempted killing of the two others, Nissage Martyr and Juders Ysem\u00e9. As part of the ruling, the jury awarded the three a combined $15.5 million in damages. The suit is the first brought against Viliena in the United States under the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991. It was filed by the San Francisco\u2013based Center for Justice and Accountability, Morrison & Foerster LLP and Dentons US LLP, which are representing the three Haitian citizens pro bono.\u201cI have dedicated over 15 years to holding Mayor Viliena accountable for ordering the murder of my brother,\u201d Boniface said. \u201cToday\u2019s verdict brings justice to me, my family and the other families of those who have been victims of Viliena\u2019s campaign of terror. I believe justice uplifts a nation, and that\u2019s why I have continued to pursue this case for all this time.\u201dViliena\u2019s attorney, Peter Haley, declined to comment. In court filings, Viliena denied the allegations and asked Judge Allison Burroughs to throw out the case over a lack of evidence. That was denied. The lawsuit accused Viliena of killing Boniface\u2019s brother, attempting to kill Ysem\u00e9 and Martyr during a 2008 government raid on a community radio station, and burning down 36 homes in 2009. The alleged crimes occurred in Les Irois, a town in western Haiti. The Torture Victim Protection Act allows civil suits to be filed in the United States against foreign officials who have committed torture or unauthorized killing, if all legal avenues have been pursued. In this case, the plaintiffs said they had filed several unsuccessful complaints in Haiti against Viliena and his allies since 2007. Viliena fled to Massachusetts in 2009, and is a lawful permanent resident. He governed Les Irois remotely until early 2010, with occasional visits to the country. Viliena was elected mayor of Les Irois as a candidate for the Haitian Democratic and Reform Movement in December 2006. The complaint says he was elected using voter fraud and violence, carried out by members of the Committee for Resistance in Grand-Anse \u2014 known in Haiti as KOREGA \u2014 a political group that uses armed individuals to gain power. In 2007, Boniface, a human rights activist, was trying to assist a neighbor who had filed a complaint against Viliena and his allies. Viliena led an armed group to his home where they kiilled his younger brother, 23-year-old Eclesiaste Boniface.Plaintiffs Ysem\u00e9 and Martyr also alleged Viliena and the militia raided the community radio station Martyr helped set up in his home in 2008, with financial support from the political party opposing Viliena\u2019s. A raid by local government officials, Viliena and the militia shut down the station and left Ysem\u00e9 blinded, while Nissand\u00e8re Martyr\u2019s father Nissage was attacked and later had to have his leg amputated, according to court documents. There was a criminal investigation into the killing of Eclesiaste Boniface and the attack on the radio station; Viliena was detained and then released. He fled to Massachusetts, but continued to govern remotely, deploying militia to attack his opponents and occasionally returned for brief trips. During one such trip, Viliena\u2019s associates burned 36 homes in Les Irois, the plaintiffs alleged. The jury did not find Viliena liable for that arson.The ruling gives a sense of justice to the platiniffs, but they\u2019re worried about what awaits them at home, and about retribution toward their families from Viliena\u2019s associates there. Before and during the trial, courts have issued multiple protective orders after plaintiff attorneys were alerted to threats that were being made against family members and witnesses who testified in the case.\u201cWhen Jean Morose and his people came to kill me, they killed my brother Eclesiaste instead. So I'm very fearful for my people that are still in Haiti,\u201d Boniface told GBH News. \u201cGod protects them. And we also have an order from the court to protect them for people that have been threatened.\u201dAfter the verdict was read, the plaintiffs stood proudly outside the federal courthouse in Boston\u2019s Seaport around a plaque describing justice. \u201cMy father, Nissage Martyr, suffered greatly after he and his friend Juders Ysem\u00e9 were shot during the radio station attack,\u201d Nissand\u00e8re Martyr said Tuesday. He took his father\u2019s place as a plaintiff in 2017. Nissage Martyr died under \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d the day after the lawsuit was filed in Boston, said one of the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys.\u201cThough I lost my father in 2017, I know if he were still living, he would be proud that I stepped into his shoes and continued the case with the other victims. We have pursued Viliena despite many obstacles. And despite his continued denials, today we received a positive verdict,\u201d said Nissand\u00e8re Martyr.",

        "body": "On the toasty morning of July 15, 1891, four middle-aged women met at Rowes Wharf in Boston, boarded a boat and set sail for one of the outermost harbor islands: Great Brewster. At the time, its rugged landscape was home to little more than a smattering of structures \u2014 including \"huts of refuge\" for potential shipwreck survivors \u2014 and a single cow that roamed the island. The women were leaving their husbands, children and responsibilities behind for more than two weeks in search of adventure and the joy of female friendship. Their provisions included food, art supplies, literature and one leather-bound journal. And it\u2019s that journal that, over a century later, mesmerized Boston-based author Stephanie Schorow when she came across the volume in Harvard\u2019s Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America.\u201cBut there was one big problem with it,\u201d Schorow said. \u201cWe knew the identity of one of the women in the diary. But we didn\u2019t know the other three women. Now, we had their photos \u2014 but we did not have their names.\u201dThe journal detailed the cold corned beef they ate and the poetry they read by moonlight. It recorded the tides and the flora of the island. Photographs, a novelty back then, showed their rustic cottage. It was the site where they pitched a hammock and hoisted an American flag \u2014 which, at the time, had only 43 stars. They adopted their own playful language \u2014 a mix of Shakespearean and swashbuckler \u2014 sprinkling in the word \u201cYe\u201d for flair. \u201cThe women in the journal were only identified by their nicknames: The Autocrat, the Aristocrat, the Acrobat and the Scribe \u2014 which, when you get down to it, are kind of weird nicknames,\u201d Schorow said.One of the women, whose moniker was \u201cYe Veracious Scribe,\u201d had already been identified as Helen Augusta Whittier, a Lowell resident whose name was found on a handwritten note in the journal. Schorow tried to focus on her other projects: she\u2019s the author of several books on Boston\u2019s history. But the journal \u2014 and the peculiar women who created it \u2014 kept returning to her mind, and the hunch that its creators had their own contributions to make to modern-day scholarship.Schorow made a few phone calls to solicit help identifying the women.A collection of about 10 people, almost exclusively older women, stepped forward to volunteer their research skills in 2020, when the pandemic kept them all home. Over Zoom and emails, they began by transcribing the journal, which, due to the abundance of \u201cye\u201ds and antiquated penmanship, wasn\u2019t simple.\u201cThey don\u2019t teach cursive to students anymore. But we\u2019re old gals. So we wrote in cursive. We could decipher it,\u201d Schorow said. \u201cBut even then, there were some parts we\u2019d say, \u2018I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re saying here.\u2019\u201dOnce the journal was transcribed, the next task was to distinguish which woman \u2014 their names still unknown \u2014 wrote which entries. One of the investigators, Allison Andrews, had previous experience evaluating handwriting and cataloguing photographs. She noticed that some of the writers used periods, and some wrote with a dash. The group stitched together census records, newspaper clippings and public records from genealogy websites. And now, after years of research, they feel confident they have identified all four women: Helen Francis Ray French was the \u201cYe Autocrat.\u201d The daughter of a clothing manufacturer in Lowell, she later ran a lodging house with her husband. \u201cYe Gentle Aristocrat\u201d was Sarah Elizabeth \u201cLizzie\u201d Dean Adams, a founding member of two humanitarian clubs in New England.\u201cYe Artistic Acrobat\u201d was Isabella Coburn, a well-known painter who studied at the New England Conservatory of Music and what\u2019s now the Massachusetts College of Art. Coburn died of heart failure four years after the trip. And the trip\u2019s ringleader, nicknamed \u201cYe Veracious Scribe,\u201d was Helen Augustua Whittier. She never married and ran her family\u2019s textile mill in Lowell, before founding a Boston newsletter for women and becoming a leader in New England\u2019s women\u2019s suffrage movement. \u201cWe can only suppose that they were trying to say to the world, \u2018We can do it ourselves. Women can do it ourselves,\u2019\u201d Schorow said.Journal entries describe how they foraged and fished: After dinner, 2 of them, with rubbers, pails and spoons, left to go get clams. With regret, they left a ruddy sunset and soon found their friends with long face and cut hands...but no clams.Yet another page has a small, exquisite watercolor painting of a lobster with the handwritten caption: \u201cYe hot lobster.\u201dProfessor John Stilgoe, who teaches the history of landscape at Harvard University, first discovered the journal in a used book store while on a bike ride in Cape Ann in 1999. On the counter inside, the leather-bound volume lay open, its pages an organic collection of cursive writing, watercolors and early photographs depicting women on a remote coast. \u201cI took one look at it and was staggered by its beauty,\u201d he said. He pledged to the bookseller that Harvard would buy it. \u201cAnd put down my own credit card and told him if Harvard didn\u2019t buy it, I would buy it.\u201d Harvard pounced, buying the volume sight-unseen. Stilgoe said he was not surprised the women knew how to describe, draw and paint the plants and seascape around them: He\u2019s researched how educated American women in that era studied Latin and botany. But Stilgoe\u2019s discovery at the bookstore was not the first time the book had been rescued. Ann Marie Allen is a retired chemist and theologian who helped solve the mystery. She said the journal has had several close calls, starting with that inaugural trip to the rustic cottage more than a century ago.\u201cWhen it rained, [the roof] leaked. It poured inside the house. And they talked about running around and getting buckets to catch the water. They talked about rescuing the book that we\u2019re talking about \u2014 rescuing that log book from the deluge that was coming through the roof,\u201d Allen said.The last page of the journal is a watercolor painting of the island with the rickety cottage. In the margin is the handwritten note, \u201cA small green isle \u2014 it seemed \u2014 no more.\u201d One of the essays the women read aloud was \u201cWestminster Abbey,\u201d a somber reflection by Washington Irving on the fleeting of time.\u201cAnd one of them made mention of memories, and things we leave behind for people to find out something about ourselves. And I just thought, those women quoted from or read that particular passage. Did they ever dream that their journal was going to be looked at over 100 years later?\u201d Allen said.Irving wrote: Time is ever silently turning over his pages; we are too much engrossed by the story of the present, to think of the characters and anecdotes that gave interest to the past; and each age is a volume thrown aside to be speedily forgotten.But this leather-bound volume will not be forgotten. These modern-day sleuths have joined hands with the Friends of the Boston Harbor Islands to publish the journal in June. In addition to the original entries from 1891, their book will chronicle the detective work that led to the discovery of the travelers\u2019 identities, with proceeds going to the nonprofit. With the printing, it will preserve this snapshot of Boston Harbor\u2019s history, and preserve the women themselves \u2014 under their own names.",

        "body": "Gov. Maura Healey wants her $55.5 billion state budget to offer a \u201cglide path\u201d to help Massachusetts and its residents adapt to the coming end of the federal COVID-19 public health emergency, she told state lawmakers Tuesday. During the pandemic, the federal government stepped up its support for an array of state programs. But with the emergency now set to expire on May 11, one major question facing Beacon Hill budget writers is how much of that spending the state can afford on its own. As Healey and her budget team briefed the Legislature\u2019s Ways and Means Committee on the details of her spending plan, its House and Senate chairmen both had the emergency\u2019s end on their mind. \u201cFrom food assistance to greater SNAP benefits to expanded funds for MassHealth, those COVID-era programs are being phased out by the federal government for one reason or another,\u201d House Ways and Means Chairman Aaron Michlewitz said. \u201cThe commonwealth has picked up the cost for some of these programs over the last couple years, such as universal school meals. However, a longer-term, more fiscally realistic approach needs to be addressed as we determine how to best manage this phasing-out of certain federal programs going forward.\u201d In addition to Healey\u2019s annual budget proposal, lawmakers are currently working their way through a separate supplemental spending bill that would steer $65 million more into the state\u2019s free school meals program and use $130 million in state money to provide some elevated SNAP benefits after the federal government\u2019s pandemic-era boost to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program expired last week.\u201cObviously the last three years have been unprecedented in terms of what we\u2019ve seen, including relief that\u2019s come from the federal government, and with the recognition that\u2019s going away, our proposal and where we\u2019ve been on a few things that we\u2019ve filed is an effort to try to work, of course, with all of you in providing people with a basic glide path off of this,\u201d Healey told lawmakers. MassHealth, the Massachusetts Medicaid program, is the single largest program state government operates, accounting for over 30% of overall spending. Healey\u2019s budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1 funds MassHealth at $19.8 billion, down $1.9 billion from this year\u2019s estimated spending. Matt Gorzkowicz, Healey\u2019s administration and finance secretary, said Tuesday that decrease is driven by a projected drop in MassHealth\u2019s caseload. Preliminary projections show the current caseload of 2.3 million MassHealth members could be down to 1.9 million by the end of the next fiscal year, he said. State Medicaid agencies received additional federal reimbursement during the public health emergency, tied to a freeze in eligibility redeterminations that move people off Medicaid coverage when they no longer qualify for it. Gorzkowicz said the $19.8 billion funding level for MassHealth \u201cmaintains affordable, equitable, comprehensive health care coverage for Medicaid-eligible members without reducing benefits.\u201d He said the agency has outreach plans in place, and Healey's budget proposes $5 million in additional funding at the Executive Office of Health and Human Services for communication with MassHealth members. \u201cThe goal is not to simply disenroll folks,\u201d Gorzkowicz said. \u201cThe goal is to determine proper eligibility, proper coverage of care, and make sure that through our Health Connector and through employer-sponsored insurance that folks have the insurance they need.\u201d Healey, who met with Biden administration officials on a trip to Washington, D.C. last month, told lawmakers she\u2019s ready to advocate with the federal government for what the state needs. \u201cI will tell you and offer to you that whatever I can do in terms of advocacy vis-a-vis the Biden administration with respect to making some allowances or changing the course of some of what is happening around the end of the public health emergency,\u201d she said. Lawmakers on the Ways and Means Committee plan seven other hearings on Healey\u2019s budget before the House and Senate each rewrite her bill and debate their own versions. The next hearing, focused on education and local aid, is scheduled for Monday, March 13, at UMass Amherst. GBH News is teaming up with New England Public Media in Western, MA and CAI on the Cape, coast and islands, to take a closer look at Governor Healey's political agenda. We'd like to hear what you think. Do her priorities line up with issues that are top of mind for you? What should she be focusing on? Go to our form and have your say.",

Cox, who officially assumed leadership of the department in August, said the police department should also improve the quality of its internal investigations and its disciplinary history records.\u201cI think if we fire somebody, they should stay fired,\u201d said Cox while marking his inaugural appearance on Boston Public Radio. \u201cThat being said, I think we also need to own the fact that we need to do better investigations to make sure that they stay fired \u2014 to make sure that we\u2019re contacting the people appropriately, make sure we\u2019re documenting things along the way, so it makes it a whole lot harder for an arbitrator to rule against us.\u201dCox echoed a sentiment held by his boss, Mayor Michelle Wu, who campaigned on a pledge to achieve certain reforms through a renegotiated contract agreement with the city\u2019s police force. The Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Association, the city\u2019s largest police union that represents rank and file officers, attempted to halt negotiations late last year after the organization sought intervention from the Joint Labor Management Committee, the states\u2019 collective bargaining oversight and dispute resolution agency. The Wu administration asserts the collective bargaining process is ongoing. Wu has said publicly that establishing parameters for dismissals that cannot be appealed is a red line for her administration in the talks.Cox said in his view, arbitration awards have \"far been too generous\" to police unions in representation about fired individuals coming back on.\u201cEither an officer belongs on the job, or they don\u2019t \u2014 and our job is to make sure that we investigate and do all we can to separate the ones that don't belong here,\u201d he added.Mayor Michelle Wu announced Cox as her selection last July after the force had only interim leadership for more than a year.The commissioner took the helm of a department sieged by multiple scandals involving past and pending investigations, among them: the conviction of a former police union head for child abuse allegations corroborated while he was an officer decades before; the sudden dismissal of a former commissioner over decades old domestic abuse allegations; and the alleged participation of at least one officer in the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol attack. That investigation, which has now dragged on for nearly two years, will \u201csoon\u201d end, Cox said, parroting an assertion from Wu last month. \u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on something pending beforehand so we can have a reason for someone to arbitrate against us,\u201d he said to laughter.Cox also expressed support for police officers being stationed in public schools, arguing that the exposure could counter stereotypes and fear.\u201cWhen my kids were little and they were afraid of the dark, I didn't say, \u2018Never walk into the dark again.\u2019 I tried to help them through it \u2026 and let them know, you turn a light on and see it\u2019s nothing to be afraid of here. There's nothing to be afraid of about policing,\u201d Cox said. \u201cPolicing being done now is better than it's ever been done in the history of policing. But the reality is the narrative that's out there is almost the opposite because of social media and things of that nature. When you have to scan the entire United States to find one example here or one example there, that is not a systemic problem.\u201d",

        "body": "Updated at 9:59 a.m. March 8SeparatorIt was an outcome predicted by many in Everett, a city that has been roiled by political and racial tensions over several years.On Monday night the city\u2019s school committee voted 6-4 not to renew Superintendent Priya Tahiliani's contract. She was considered a star among fellow superintendents and praised by community members, but Everett\u2019s long-serving mayor was among those who voted her out.Tahiliani called the support she received at the meeting \u201coverwhelming and heartening.\u201d\"As educators, everything we do is with the hopes of making some small impact. And last night, I felt reassured that I am doing my job. I will carry that encouragement and support with me through this difficult time,\" Tahiliani said in a statement.Tahiliani has served as Everett's superintendent since March 2020. As a woman of Indian origin, she was the first person of color to hold the post in a district where more than 80% of students are non-white and 89% of teachers are white. Just last year, she was awarded a statewide prize from the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents. Her supporters, including M.A.S.S. Executive Director Tom Scott, said she'd brought needed stability to the school district after the previous superintendent was convicted of indecent assault of a school employee. Tahiliani had also received broadly positive feedback in school committee appraisals for the past two years. Mayor Carlo DeMaria was among those supporters in 2021 \u2014 but last year he was the lone committee member not to submit any appraisal. In January 2022, Tahiliani filed a discrimination complaint against DeMaria, accusing him and others on the school committee of racism, sexism and interference with her work. And she alleged he was trying to \u201coust\u201d her.The disconnect between the superintendent's positive feedback and committee members' critical views angered some members of the public at Monday's meeting, who blamed \u201cold school politics\u201d and racism for the decision. \u201cBasically, as I see it, you have two choices. You have racism or anti-racism. Go back to the past or embrace the present and the future. You can use students, families and educators as pawns in your own internal squabbles. Or you can empower them,\u201c said teacher Shane McNally, addressing the committee before the vote. Several residents at the public microphone pointed to the influence of the mayor, now serving his sixth term in Everett. Resident Janice Lark called it \"a no brainer\" to renew Tahiliani and called for her opponents on the council to explain their positions. \u201cThe guy in the corner office does not want her here. We all know that,\u201d Lark said. \u201cIs it because her skin is brown? Is it because she's female? Is it because she's smart? What is it?\u201d DeMaria did not explain his vote, but had made public his opposition to the superintendent in previous meetings. Others who voted no, like committee member Cynthia Sarnie, spoke of being harassed by members of the public and denied rumors that their votes had been bought. She also offered some specifics. \u201cMy vote would be based on the safety of the school and the cleaning and cleanliness of the schools,\u201d said Sarnie. Marconi Almeida Barros, the lone member of color on the school committee, said Tahiliani had earned the committee\u2019s support and reminded his colleagues they were the \u201cvoice\u201d for students and families. \u201cI don\u2019t know how after listening to all of this, especially from students and parents, we would say no to the superintendent,\u201d Almeida Barros said.Several students of color, like Everett high school junior Tiana Allen, came to the public microphone to explain why having Tahiliani in the role mattered. \u201cWhen students see someone that looks exactly like them, holding amazing leadership skills and positions, it drives the students to do more,\u201d said Allen, \u201dto reach for positions that felt so unbelievably out of reach... It means to drive Everett do more.\u201d Tahiliani's current contract runs to March 2024.Qualified superintendents are in short supply nationally. According to M.A.S.S., the state currently needs to fill 45 of the 275 superintendent positions.Speaking to the school committee, Benjamin Murray, a teacher and member of his union\u2019s negotiating committee made a dire prediction. \"On the line is the future of the city, that is what\u2019s on the line,\u201d said Murray. \u201cIf you let her go tonight, you will not see another qualified candidate come across your table again.\"SeparatorThis story was updated to include comment from Tahiliani.",

        "body": "Sixty years ago, the Supreme Court recognized that criminal defendants have a right to counsel at trial, which means that if they're too poor to pay for an attorney, the government will assign one. Nowadays, defendants have a right not only to a lawyer, but to an effective lawyer. But judges have struggled with how to draw the line between effective and ineffective, and this has huge implications: If a judge finds that defense counsel is ineffective, it can lead to a new trial. GBH legal analyst and Northeastern University law professor Daniel Medwed joined Morning Edition co-host Jeremy Siegel to talk about a case that could change how that's done in Massachusetts. This transcript has been lightly edited. Jeremy Siegel: This is something that I think a lot of people know a little bit about, and not that many people know a lot about. I might be dating myself a little bit here, but I did not even know that the right to counsel came just 60 years ago. It's something I'm familiar with because of TV shows where police tell you 'you have the right to remain silent' and that you have the right to an attorney. But it's definitely less-known that you have a right to an effective attorney. You don't hear police officers in TV shows saying that to people when they're arrested. How exactly does this work? Daniel Medwed: As you mentioned at the top, a series of Supreme Court cases have carved out a federal constitutional right to an effective attorney at the pretrial and trial stages of your case, which means that if you can prove that your lawyer was ineffective, you can get a new trial. The problem is the Supreme Court has created a very, very high bar for proving that your lawyer was ineffective. The test comes from a rather well-known 1984 case called Strickland v. Washington, which set up a two-part standard. First, as a defendant who lost a trial, you have to prove on appeal that your trial lawyer was defective, was deficient: they failed to investigate the case, they didn't put on an alibi witness, they didn't cross-examine their opponents, things like that. And then second, you have to show that the deficiency somehow contributed to the bad verdict, to the conviction. In other words, it's not enough to show that your lawyer messed up. You have to show that that error was somehow outcome-determinative. Siegel: I think for people trying to make sense of this, in a way, it makes sense that you want to make it a thorough process to prove that someone's ineffective, because you don't want people abusing it and appealing every case on this. But the second part of that kind of stuck out to me: That you don't just have to prove that your lawyer is ineffective, but you essentially have to prove that their horrible work as your attorney is what led to conviction at trial. Medwed: Exactly. It's a little bit like the no harm, no foul concept in sports. You actually have to show that there was an impact on the ultimate decision because of the error. And this can lead to some absurd outcomes. I saw one study that found that 97% of the time when a defendant raises one of these ineffectiveness issues on appeal, they lose. And cases where lawyers were drunk or under the influence of drugs have been upheld, or at least not considered ineffective performance of counsel. One despicable case from Texas, I think, is really illustrative: A man is charged with murder and he's facing the death penalty. He's too poor to pay for a lawyer, so he's assigned one by the court. That lawyer falls asleep intermittently throughout the trial. The defendant goes to the judge to alert the judge about this, and here's the judge's response: the Constitution says you're entitled to an attorney. It says nothing about that attorney being awake. Siegel: That's just shocking to hear that. Daniel, tell us about the situation here in Massachusetts. Do we have to follow the Supreme Court case law or could we, say, provide more protection to criminal defendants in these situations? Medwed: Well, here in Massachusetts, we could create a more robust ineffectiveness doctrine than the Supreme Court demands. And here's why: it's often said that the federal Constitution is a floor. States can't provide fewer rights, less protection, than the Supreme Court and the federal Constitution require. But there's no ceiling. We can always provide more. So that's one reason among many why we still have a robust right for people to terminate pregnancies if they so choose, even though the U.S. Supreme Court has eviscerated the federal constitutional right to choice in the Dobbs case from last year. So we could create a more robust right if we wanted. Siegel: I mentioned earlier that there is a case pending in Massachusetts that could affect how these types of ineffective lawyering claims end up being treated. What exactly is at stake here? Medwed: So tomorrow, the SJC is going to hear oral arguments in a case involving a defendant named Nyasani Watt. The facts are pretty procedurally complicated, but here's the main gist: Watt was charged with first degree murder for participating in the shooting death of a young man in Dorchester back in 2011. Watt was only 17 at the time. The case went to trial a few years later, he was convicted, sentenced to life behind bars, and then he lost his appeal. Fast-forward another few years: He accumulated some evidence that his lawyer had fallen asleep off and on at trial. And he even got affidavits from a bunch of courtroom observers, folks who were in the courtroom at the time of the trial, including several prosecutors, to verify that the lawyer fell asleep. So Watt assembled all this information and filed a post-appeal motion with the original trial judge. But the trial judge said there wasn't enough information that the lawyer fell asleep at critical parts of the trial or for a substantial portion of the trial. So at least in theory, this case could provide an opportunity for the court to really evaluate whether we tolerate sleeping lawyers in criminal cases in Massachusetts. Siegel: So what do you think will end up happening here? Medwed: You know, I'm not so sure. On the one hand, there are lots of issues in this case, and it's possible the SJC will hang its hat on another issue and bypass that substantive issue altogether. For instance, there's a question about whether why Watt waited too long to file this claim, whether he should have acted earlier in the process, or whether the fact that he was really young at the time of his trial and appeal should excuse that failure to raise it before. On the other hand, if the court is inclined to take another look at the substantive doctrine here, it could provide a chance to create greater protections for criminal defendants in Massachusetts than the federal Constitution demands.",

        "body": "Two months after she took office, Gov. Maura Healey is now backed up by a full cabinet \u2014 at least as it's currently envisioned.Capping off the slate she\u2019s been gradually building since December, Healey\u2019s final two picks \u2013 former state Rep. Jon Santiago as veterans\u2019 services secretary and former Boston Medical Center CEO Kate Walsh as health and human services secretary \u2013 were sworn in March 1. Joined by family members in Healey's office, they took ceremonial oaths again last Friday before sitting down for their first full Cabinet meeting. Gesturing at the members of veterans services organizations who packed the room, Walsh said it was \"an honor to be sworn in with this crowd \u2013 and thanks, Jon, for bringing a crowd.\"The crowd will soon grow bigger. Healey's cabinet is already larger than the one her predecessor, former Gov. Charlie Baker, left office with \u2013 and more diverse, with six women and four people of color. She's looking to add one more member, and filed legislation last week that would officially add a secretary of housing and livable communities. Of Healey's current cabinet, most are Beacon Hill veterans, including several who already proved themselves as trusted deputies working under Healey in the attorney general\u2019s office. Three served in the administration of the state\u2019s last Democrat governor, Deval Patrick, two worked under former Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, and one joins Healey\u2019s team from the Biden Administration. Suffolk University political science professor Rachael Cobb said Healey's assembled a \"competent group of people,\" with deep and broad knowledge in their fields, from an education secretary with a classroom background to a finance secretary versed in the intracacies of higher education funding \u2013 a theme of the first budget he helped build. \"If we want competence in governance, and we in a democracy elected the executive to implement things, they are people in charge of that policy implementation,\" Cobb said.The 11 cabinet secretaries are the Healey administration\u2019s top officials, overseeing everything from the state\u2019s Medicaid program to its schools, highways, parks, prisons and cybersecurity systems. Despite years of experience in their fields and in government, many are relatively unknown to the public. Here\u2019s a look at who will have Healey\u2019s ear on some of the most pressing issues facing the state. Administration and Finance Secretary Matt Gorzkowicz: Healey\u2019s budget chief was her first appointment, and his initial task was crafting her $55.5 billion spending plan. Gorzkowicz joined the administration from the UMass president\u2019s office, where he spent more than a decade as associate vice president of administration and finance. The Winthrop resident has had a long, behind-the-scenes career in state government, with time at the state Senate, Department of Mental Health and School Building Authority. The Executive Office of Administration and Finance is familiar territory for him, too \u2013 he served as assistant secretary for budget and later as undersecretary under Gov. Patrick. Education Secretary Patrick Tutwiler: Tutwiler has seen firsthand what state education policy looks like in the field \u2013 he\u2019s worked in the Boston, Westford, Wayland and Lynn school systems, as a history teacher, principal and superintendent. As Lynn's superintendent, he testified last year before the state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education about the challenges districts faced as they emerged from the COVID-19 remote learning era. He also helped establish Lynn\u2019s early college program, which is relevant now because Healey wants to expand early college offerings. Before joining the Healey administration, Tutwiler was senior program officer for education at the Barr Foundation, an organization that Healey worked with on various initiatives as attorney general. Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Rebecca Tepper: Tepper is continuing as Healey's top advisor on energy and the environment, coming from her previous role as chief of the energy and environment bureau in the AG's office. Before that, she worked as general counsel for the state Department of Public Utilities, an agency that's now under her purview, and director of the Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board. Tepper, too, has drawn from the AG's office as she staffs up, recently announcing Elizabeth Mahony, a former assistant attorney general, as the new Department of Energy Resources commissioner. Climate Chief Melissa Hoffer: On Healey\u2019s second day as governor, she signed an executive order creating the cabinet post of climate chief, a national first. Hoffer's job is to advise Healey and lead development and implementation of climate policy across agencies. Again, Healey\u2019s used to hearing from her: Hoffer was chief of the AG\u2019s energy and environment bureau before Tepper, and led Healey\u2019s high-profile climate change litigation against ExxonMobil. Hoffer left the AG\u2019s office to work in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as an appointee of President Joe Biden, and she\u2019s also worked for the Conservation Law Foundation, active advocates on Beacon Hill. Public Safety and Security Secretary Terrence Reidy: The sole holdover from Gov. Charlie Baker\u2019s cabinet, Reidy has been the state\u2019s top public safety official since July 2021. He, too, has previous Healey ties \u2013 he was an assistant attorney general and chief of her enterprise, major and cyber crimes division. Reidy and Healey also teamed up last July to issue guidance clarifying the state\u2019s gun licensing laws in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court decision that struck down a New York law around licenses to carry firearms in public. Earlier in his career, he was an assistant district attorney in Suffolk and Worcester counties. Economic Development Secretary Yvonne Hao: Without prior public-sector experience, Hao is a bit of an outlier among the secretaries. But she brings to the role more than 25 years of executive business experience, and what Healey described as \"a proven record of growing businesses and turning ideas into results.\" The first woman and first person of color to lead the state's chief economic development agency, Hao has links to the eastern and western parts of the state, with homes in Cambridge and Williamstown. She cofounded Boston investment firm Cove Hill Partners, and her resume also includes prominent positions at venture capital firm Pillar Ventures, online pharmacy PillPack, and Bain Capital.Labor and Workforce Development Secretary Lauren Jones: This is a homecoming for Jones, formerly communications director for the labor secretariat. Jones held that post during the Patrick administration, when she was also a top aide to Lt. Gov. Tim Murray. After the State House, Jones joined Walsh\u2019s team in Boston City Hall and went on to work for the Massachusetts Business Roundtable. She served on a legislative commission last session that found the state must transform its education and worker training programs \"to ensure workers are connected to the jobs of the future\" \u2013 and make sure people have the childcare, transportation and housing they need to participate in the workforce. Transportation Secretary Gina Fiandaca: Fiandaca, now in charge of the MBTA, the Registry of Motor Vehicles, and state roads, long had a front-row seat the to the challenges of getting around the state\u2019s capital city, leading Boston\u2019s parking office and later, under former Mayor Walsh, its full transportation department. She\u2019s returning to Massachusetts after a stint as assistant city manager in Austin, Texas, overseeing infrastructure and mobility departments. When she took on that role, she told the Austin American-Statesman that her toughest day on the job in the past was Boston\u2019s winter of 2015, when historic snowfalls walloped the city\u2019s transportation system. Technology Services and Security Secretary Jason Snyder: Snyder joined Healey's team after almost a decade at Harvard University, where he was most recently chief technology officer. He fills a Cabinet post Gov. Baker created in 2017 to elevate IT and cybersecurity services, and is returning to state government to do so \u2014 Snyder was the state's chief technology officer during Gov. Patrick's two terms. He's also worked in the private sector, for the IT service provider CSC Consulting Group.Health and Human Services Secretary Kate Walsh: While Walsh hasn\u2019t worked for the state before, she\u2019s been an active presence on Beacon Hill for years, testifying on health matters and serving on commissions addressing digital health care, wage equity and more. Walsh and Healey have worked together before on gun safety. The longtime hospital executive is respected in her field \u2013 Massachusetts Health and Hospital Association President Steve Walsh (who is not related to Secretary Walsh) described her as \"a tireless community advocate, a health equity champion, and a consensus-builder for a complex sector entering a transformational time in care delivery.\u201d Reproductive health advocates also cheered her appointment.Veterans Services Secretary Jon Santiago: Santiago will be the first veterans secretary to report directly to the governor, the result of a reform law passed after the deadly COVID-19 outbreak at the Holyoke Soldiers\u2019 Home. Having simultaneously served as a state representative from the South End, an ER doctor at Boston Medical Center (where he worked with Secretary Walsh) and a major in the U.S. Army Reserve, he brings a unique set of experiences to the job. He ran for Boston mayor in 2021, touting his crisis-leadership skills. One of the bills Santiago filed this session would increase tax exemption thresholds for veterans, an idea he could continue to advocate for from within the administration. GBH News is teaming up with New England Public Media in Western, MA and CAI on the Cape, coast and islands, to take a closer look at Governor Healey's political agenda.

        "body": "Last year after a neo-Nazi group displayed a banner at the St. Patrick's Day Parade that read \"Keep Boston Irish\" local leaders pledged to prevent a repeat of the incident, which received international coverage. Over the past weekend, U.S. Rep. Stephen Lynch, state Sen. Nick Collins, Boston City Council President Ed Flynn, state Rep. David Biele and at-large City Councilor Michael Flaherty signed a joint letter to MBTA police Chief Kenneth Green requesting that MBTA officials take steps to keep right wing extremists away from this year\u2019s parade, which takes place on Sunday, March 19.Lynch said these extremist groups, that include NSC-131 or Nationalist Social Club, carried out violence and intimidation aboard subway and commuter trains heading into South Boston around the time of the 2022 parade. \u201cThey were damaging MTA property, commuter rail property, and there were confrontations in transit,\" Lynch told GBH News. \"And if we had had early intervention, I think we might have stopped some of these groups from actually getting to the parade.\u201dOn social media, some expressed concerns about violating the first amendment rights of right wing protesters. Collins, who represents South Boston, said those fears are misplaced. \u201cFolks are concerned about the curtailing of free speech and the First Amendment. We're not talking about that,\" Collins said. \"They defaced public property, and that's against the law. So we're sending the message out that if you break the law, you'll be held accountable.\u201dThis year\u2019s parade is predicted to bring up to a million people into South Boston, a neighborhood of about 35,000 people.\u201cSo most people coming in that day are visitors, celebrating our roots, our heritage, our multicultural communities,\u201d said Collins. \u201cWhat we're trying to ensure is that happens from beginning to end. And for most people that starts with a ride on the T.\u201dOn a Telegram channel last year, right-wing extremists referenced the 1970s racial violence against school integration to support their belief that they had local support. South Boston, or Southie as it is known locally, at the time was a mainly white Irish American neighborhood, and was a hotbed of opposition to school busing.Lynch said that was a long time ago, and since then South Boston has become a majority-minority population. And in a pointed message to NSC-131, Patriot Front and other extremists, Lynch offered a reminder of a time \u201cwhen the Ku Klux Klan came to South Boston and they were ridden out on a rail. They wrongfully assumed that that there's fertile ground here for that hate.\u201dLocal antifascist filmmakers Lauren Pespisa and Rod Webber are skeptical of the political response to the threat posed by hate groups, describing it as \u201crhetorical.\u201d Pespisa and Webber last March saw a social media post live-tweeting the presence of NSC-131 at the parade. They said they jumped into a car and made their way to South Boston where they confronted members of the group with a sign and chants, and accused the Boston police of \u201cstanding by doing nothing.\u201dPespisa told GBH News she would advise parade goers to physically protest: \u201cIf you see something, do something,\u201d to demonstrate that Nazism will not be accepted in \u201cany community.\u201d Collins said he doesn\u2019t disagree, but says whatever action is taken should be in coordination with law enforcement.\u201cWhen you see these messages [hate banners and stickers] are being put up on public property or assets, you know, they have to come down right away,\" Collins said. \"If you see this happening ... notify the transit police, if it's on the train system or if it's inside the city of Boston.\u201dLynch said the leaders have asked the MBTA to put on extra staff the weekend of March 19 and \u201cto be more keenly aware of the possibility of some of these hate groups trying to capitalize on a family parade environment to showcase their hate and intolerance.\u201d T superintendent Richard Sullivan said in a written statement the Transit Police will have an enhanced security plan for the parade. Massachusetts U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins also has also issued a reminder to residents who suspect white supremacist activity that they can report it by calling 1-83-END-H8-NOW (1-833-634-8669).Officials including Rollins, Mayor Michelle Wu, and Attorney General Andrea Campbell will meet with police and the FBI a few days before the parade to discuss safety and crowd control.

        "body": "A groundbreaking ceremony Monday kicked off construction at Opus Newton, a middle-income senior living development touted by housing developer 2Life Communities as the first of its kind in the nation. The housing nonprofit offers government-subsidized options for seniors, and the state is full of luxury housing for those in the upper end of the income bracket, said 2Life President and CEO Amy Schectman. But when it comes to the middle, a majority of older adults are left with few options. \u201cThey can't afford the high-end stuff and they don't qualify for the lower-end stuff because they earn a little bit too much money or saved a little bit too much money,\u201d Schectman said. \u201cThere's a moral imperative to close that market gap and to provide something that offers a chance for the people in the middle.\u201dThe nonprofit spent the last seven years trying to figure out how to address the needs of this specific demographic, Schectman says. To keep monthly fees low, residents pay a one-time \u201ccommunity share\u201d fee for their unit, funding that helps pay for the construction period. By providing at-home care on site, residents can opt in or out of services depending on need, which reduces costs for the nonprofit. Meals will be served three times per week, instead of nightly, and residents sign a contract to volunteer at least 10 hours of their time per month to help out with the needs of the community. \u201cPeople are coming up with more and more really interesting topics that they're going to lead, groups they're going to be part of,\u201d Schectman said. Volunteer hours can be used creatively, and some future residents have already suggested a jazz group, a choir, lecture series and question and answer sessions with nurses. \u201cLots of vibrant activity is already coming from our residents.\u201d Units at Opus begin at $380,000 to buy and $1,800 monthly to rent, according to Schectman. Opus leverages residents\u2019 home equity and offers the option to receive 80% of their up-front \u201ccommunity share\u201d payment when they leave, or use the funds for their care.Of the 174 available units, 95% have already been sold, according to a 2Life spokesperson, which enabled the nonprofit to begin construction a full year ahead of schedule. MassDevelopment, the state's finance and development agency, is supporting the project with $130 million in tax-exempt bond financing. The new housing development is slated to open in the summer of 2025, connected to the Coleman House operated by 2Life (formerly Jewish Housing for the Elderly) on the Jewish Community Center of Greater Boston\u2019s Campus. \u201cMassachusetts faces a housing crisis, and projects like Opus Newton \u2026 bring us an important step forward in easing the housing burden for Greater Boston and for Massachusetts,\u201d MassDevelopment President and CEO Dan Rivera said in a statement. State and city leaders including Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll, U.S. Rep. Jake Auchincloss (D-Massachusetts) and Newton Mayor Ruthanne Fuller were on hand for the groundbreaking Monday.\u201cWe know so many individuals in our lives are making choices about where to live based on the high cost of housing,\u201d said Driscoll. \u201cLet\u2019s make those choices easier. Let\u2019s allow people to live and grow and age with dignity in the communities they love. This is a thrilling day for Newton. Let\u2019s make sure we can have more thrilling days across this commonwealth.\"Single older people in Massachusetts are more likely to face economic insecurity than their peers in any other state \u2014 despite higher average incomes than elderly people in many other parts of the country, according to a UMass Boston study from 2019. Last month, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu announced 800 new affordable housing units throughout the city, including 160 income-restricted units for seniors.",

        "body": "It\u2019s (probably) the reason you can\u2019t convince your friend to go to a baseball game: America\u2019s favorite pastime is just too slow for some people. Now, Major League Baseball is taking that complaint to heart. New rules for the new season are designed to help speed up the game, among a slew of changes that even casual fans can expect to notice on the field. Jen McCaffrey, who covers the Red Sox for The Athletic, joined GBH's Morning Edition co-host Jeremy Siegel to discuss what's already been different as spring training gets underway. This transcript has been lightly edited. Jeremy Siegel: So before we get into these new rules, can we talk a bit about how baseball has gotten slow and why it's so slow? They actually have gotten slower compared to, say, the '80s? Jen McCaffrey: Oh, absolutely. Back even in the early '90s, games were at a more decent pace. Two and a half hours was kind of what you expected when you were watching a game. And within the past 15 to 20 years, maybe since 2000 or so, the game has slowed to it to a halt where three, three and a half hours is not out of the norm for a game at Fenway. And it's just not acceptable for fans who want to get in and out. You can also compare them to other sports that are much faster-paced. So I think baseball finally realized, and it took a while. These rules have been implemented this spring and are going to be implemented throughout this season. And so far in these spring training games, it's really quickened up the pace. The games are closer to about two and a half hours. So I think we'll see a big change throughout the season here. Siegel: One of the biggest changes is introducing the pitch clock. It sets several limitations on both the pitcher and the batter in an effort to speed up each player's at bat. What can people exactly expect to see from that? McCaffrey: It's not going to sound like much, but pitchers have 15 seconds with no runners on base, and 20 seconds when runners are on base. And that time frame doesn't sound like a lot. But you know, everybody's looking for a competitive advantage in this game. So pitchers sometimes will stand on the mound, step off. The batter will take a time out, the pitcher will take a time out. There's been restrictions put in place where the pitcher basically has to get the ball and throw it. One of the pitchers the Red Sox signed this winter, Kenley Jansen, was the slowest pitcher in the league last year in terms of throwing the ball. So he really worked this winter to quicken up his pace, and it's very noticeable. The pitch clock is going to make a huge difference. The casual fan who maybe tunes in to a handful of games a year is actually going to really notice a quickened pace and not as much lag time and not as much of the boringness that the game has gotten of late. And that's what baseball is looking to implement. Siegel: So on top of what happens on the field and what happens in-person at games, you know, obviously baseball games are broadcast on TV. Does the broadcast of commercial breaks specifically influence the timing at all? Is that at all to blame for how slow things have gotten? McCaffrey: You know, a little bit. But one of the bigger changes this year is what a lot of teams are going to be wearing. You've seen in soccer, some people might be familiar with advertisements on the actual jerseys. The Red Sox actually have MassMutual, a huge sponsor this year, to have a patch on their jersey for the first time. So you'd see advertisements blowing up. Obviously, it's a billion-dollar league so that's a very influential part of the game. Not as much in baseball \u2014 you have the commercial breaks in between innings \u2014 but it'll still factor in. And I'm sure people that pay a little bit closer attention might notice that patch on the sleeve of the jersey. It's not too distracting. But obviously, money talks. And so any of these teams are going to try to get money any way they can. And obviously they took the opportunity here. Siegel: So another change coming to baseball is the size of the bases. They've gotten bigger. There have been some altered images, showing an exaggerated size difference, shared making it seem like nearly double the size. How much bigger are they really, and what's the point of this? McCaffrey: They're about four inches bigger, which does sound like a lot. And Alex Cora, the Red Sox manager, joked in spring training they look like pizza boxes. They're not quite that big. In addition to speeding up the game, the game just got, again, boring because teams are looking for competitive advantages. So there was a lot of shifting of players around the infield, to take away from base hits and reduce offense, and offense is what people like to see. I mean, sometimes it's exciting to watch pitchers dueling it out and it being a 0-0 game, and there's kind of high drama in that. But I think for the most part, especially a casual fan, wants to see the home runs and wants to see the stolen bases. So by making the bases bigger, it makes it obviously easier for a faster player to reach the base because it's a little bit bigger. And again, when you're thinking about it, you're not thinking a couple of inches is going to matter, but it really does when you come down to these high-level athletes that have been training with the same-size bases for a number of years \u2014 or their whole life, really. And having that kind of small advantage, they think, is really going to add a little bit more offense, a little bit more speed to the game, and a little bit more excitement, too. Siegel: Another rule change coming is the ban on teams using a defensive shift. I am not a huge baseball person. My knowledge ended at the end of my sentence there. Can you explain this to me, and what's changing? McCaffrey: Sure. So basically the simplest way to put it is, again: teams are looking for those competitive advantages. So they'll shift players. There's four players on the infield. Normally, those guys are at their set positions, but teams will shift those players so they have, maybe, three players on the right side. If the batter typically hits the ball to that side, they'll kind of shift the players over to that side of the field to try to have more defenders to get to the ball quicker. That was always legal up until this year, and it was sort of something that teams realized they could do maybe around the mid-2000s. It was something the Tampa Bay Rays actually started doing and then other teams picked up on it. It became pretty prevalent throughout the league, but it took away from a lot of base hits. You know, David Ortiz was shifted on a lot. When he would hit a single that was headed towards right field, it would get picked up by the second baseman because there'd be three guys on that side of the field. Teams can't do that anymore on the infield because, again, the league wants to try to promote some more base hits here. So they're trying to make it a little bit more offensive-friendly, a little quicker, and try to just liven up the game a little bit. And it's something you might notice throughout the season, that teams aren't doing anymore \u2014 because they can't.",

        "body": "About a year ago, Boston decided to do something different: Make three bus routes, the 23, 28 and 29, fare-free for riders. The city launched a fare-free pilot program for three lines that serve many low-income people and people of color, expanding a program already in place on one line, Route 28. The city of Boston is preparing to release a report on the fare-free programs in the coming weeks. But a GBH analysis of data from the T shows that ridership more than doubled between the week of Feb. 15, 2021, before the program started, and the same week this year. Ridership on these lines is also up about 16 percent from before the pandemic, unlike other MBTA bus lines, where ridership is about 21 percent lower systemwide compared to mid-February 2020. Stacy Thompson, executive director of the transit advocacy group Livable Streets, said it isn't just the number of riders that shows the fare-free pilot has been a success so far. \"I think what's so exciting about this is that it doesn't look all that different. But for the people who are using free buses, it feels very different,\" Thompson said. \"And what that means is that when it is pouring rain outside, when it's snowing, you can get on the bus faster; the bus moves faster; there's more money in your pocket if you're not making a transfer and that's your only ride.\" The MBTA is not the first transit system in Massachusetts to test out fare-free buses. All buses though the Merrimack Valley Regional Transit Authority and the Worcester Regional Transit Authority remain fare-free as well. \"There's a lot of focus on Boston, but we actually have regional transit authorities that are doing this work and seeing similar very positive results,\" Thompson said. Thompson said she often hears people question why buses should be free for all. Why not try free fares for low-income riders only? Free bus rides do more than save people $1.70 on their fare, she said. They save them time. \"Time is money,\" she said. \"On the MBTA system in particular, they help the buses move more efficiently. They take that friction away for the bus operators. We spend so much time, energy and attention and just trying to collect money that we have to look at those tradeoffs.\"Thompson said she hopes the fare-free pilot program helps people readjust their thinking about how the MBTA at large could operate.\"We hear people say 'folks have to pay for transit to care about it, we need fares to pay for transit,'\" she said. \"And then when the data shows that those fares aren't very reliable in terms of paying for our systems, that we actually get more people on the service, and they enjoy the service more when the service is free \u2014 it freaks them out a little bit, because the data is not affirming what their assumptions are about transit.\"She compared transit to other services Americans think of as public goods, like libraries and schools: Mostly taxpayer-funded and free to use. \"The data saying going to a fare-free system makes good economic sense,\" Thompson said. \"These are political choices. Because at the end of the day, to have a world-class transit system from every corner of the state, we need greater investment.\"The fare-free experiments, she said, \"have demonstrated the proof of concept.\" As of now, the fare free pilot is set to go through February of next year in Boston.",

        "body": "For them, it was a temporary hardship. A chance to experience living in the shoes of people struggling to make every food dollar stretch. They are the congresspersons, anti-hunger advocates, and even some reporters who accepted the Food Stamp Challenge, pledging to live just one week on the same money someone would receive from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP. Massachusetts Congressman Jim McGovern took the challenge in 2007 back when he led the Congressional Hunger Caucus. He was pushing for an increase in the then $21 a week SNAP payment. The Massachusetts congressman shared his experience on the floor of the House and was frank about how hard it was to stay within the budget during the challenge. McGovern, now recognized nationally as a leading anti-hunger advocate, told NPR, that during the challenge he ate \u201csmall portions\u201d and noted it was \u201cimpossible to make healthy choices.\u201d McGovern said he was humbled by his constituents whose everyday reality was staving off hunger for themselves and their families.Massachusetts SNAP recipients receive benefits based on their income and household size. For a family of four with a monthly income of about $4,000, the maximum benefit is $939 monthly, about $234 weekly. It\u2019s important to note that SNAP funds were always meant to be supplemental \u2014 extra money for food \u2014 in addition to whatever SNAP recipients can also pay out of pocket. Typically, recipients \u2014 mostly working poor \u2014 can\u2019t add much, so their contribution plus SNAP is usually not enough to keep food in the cupboard.But COVID emergency funding provided a boost to the regular supplemental payments and offered greater relief for around 650,000 Massachusetts households. Until last week, when the SNAP emergency boosted payments ended. For local SNAP recipients, that means an average of $97 to $280 less monthly at a time when inflation is driving up the cost of everything, but especially the cost of food. Consumers are paying up to 7% more for dairy products, 10% more for processed food and vegetables, and 5% more for meats. Even Americans who don\u2019t rely on food assistance have been forced to make deep cuts in the family food budget. But experts predict the loss of extra food assistance will push low-income recipients off, what some describe, as a \u201chunger cliff.\u201d35-year-old Natalie Sharp of Pittsfield, Massachusetts, told Washington-based newspaper The Hill: \u201cWe have access to local food pantries and aren\u2019t afraid or ashamed to use them.\u201d However, the more than 600 hunger relief agencies statewide partnering with the Greater Boston Food Bank, including food pantries, are already strained, providing food for twice as many as people they did before the pandemic. They are not equipped to fill in the gap. As Catherine Lynn, vice president for communication for the Greater Boston Food Bank explained, \u201cFor every meal a food bank provides, SNAP provides 5.\u201dGov. Maura Healey put $130 million in her budget to replace 40% of the boosted federal payments for three more months. The House has already moved quickly to pass it. If it also passes the state Senate it will be a temporary stopgap \u2014 a much needed one, but temporary. Still a long way from a long-term solution. What will it take for us as a nation to find a better solution and to decide that the very least we can do is make sure people don\u2019t go hungry?",

        "body": "Contract renewals for school superintendents are rarely controversial\u2014especially when qualified candidates are in short supply, and when the candidate in question has just been lauded by the state association of superintendents for her work.And yet in Everett, where the school district is still reeling from the conviction of a longtime former school superintendent for indecent assault, local politics have a reputation for being complex. So the outcome of the vote anticipated Monday night on whether or not to renew the contract of the current superintendent, Priya Tahiliani, is uncertain. Everett\u2019s Mayor Carlo DeMaria has made it clear he wants Tahiliani out.Tahiliani took on the role in December of 2019, unanimously appointed by the school committee after a search that, for the first time, included teachers and community members. She was the first superintendent who didn't come up through the ranks of the Everett school district. And as a woman of Indian origin, she was the first superintendent of color in a school district where more than 80% of the student body is non-white, and where teachers are 89% white. Her hiring marked a new chapter for Everett, which in recent years has seen several incidents of racism in city government.But Tahiliani's position as superintendent has become another episode of strife in the city\u2019s history. \u201cThere\u2019s an injustice to this,\u201d said Tom Scott, executive director of the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents (MASS) which gave Tahiliani a statewide award last year.\u201cI just can\u2019t stand by,\" Scott said, acknowledging that it's unusual for MASS to publicly weigh in on a local issue. \u201cWe can tell you a lot about, you know, the competency skills that she has. And we can also know by just simply reading the newspaper how politicized the Everett situation has become,\u201d Scott said. \u201cSo the question really comes down to, \u2018Are we making a decision based on the politics? Are we making the decision based on what\u2019s in the best interests of kids?'\u201dScott also said Everett\u2019s schools need the \u201cstable leadership\u201d Tahiliani had provided. Tahiliani\u2019s predecessor, Frederick Foresteire, who held the position for nearly three decades, was recently released from jail pending an appeal of his conviction of assault on a female employee. Last month, he also pleaded guilty to two additional counts of indecent assault and battery on two women he supervised at the Everett Public School Department. Trying to \u201coust\u201d herEarly on, Tahiliani diversified district leadership and the teacher workforce, and community members say she bridged gaps between schools and families. But just over two years into her tenure, she filed a discrimination complaint against the city, the mayor and the school committee alleging \u201cblatant and overt acts of discrimination and retaliation,\u201d alleging that the mayor and his allies on the school committee were trying to \u201coust\u201d her. The complaint, filed with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination and now potentially heading to Superior Court, also accused the mayor and other members of the school committee of interfering with her day-to-day management of the district. Tahiliani alleged that Mayor DeMaria was troubled when she filled open positions with minority candidates, accusing her of \"racism\" because he felt she hired only people of color and excluded white people. Tahiliani had received generally positive performance reviews from the school committee\u2014and from the mayor in 2021. In 2022, the school committee again gave mostly positive reviews, but the mayor was the lone member who did not submit an appraisal. In November, the school committee vote to approve contract negotiations with Tahiliani narrowly passed, with the mayor and several others voting against it. Months before, the mayor had publicly signaled his feelings about the issue; he cited \u201cpersonal attacks\u201d against him from supporters of Tahiliani that \u201cdivide\u201d the city.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen this city in such a bad way in all my 30 years serving in government,\u201d DeMaria said. Being \u201cEverett enough\u201dEverett\u2019s demographics have shifted rapidly over the decades; the majority of the city now is non-white, but those in political power are still mostly white. DeMaria, who has been in local politics in Everett for most of his life, is in his fifth term as mayor. His office declined requests for comment.Residents talk openly about what it means to be \u201cEverett enough\u201d to hold political power. \u201cEverett has always been what I refer to as the \u2018good old boys\u2019 network,\u201d said Sandy Juliano, who was born and raised in Everett and has a real estate business there. \u201cYou\u2019re an insider and that\u2019s all there is to it.\u201dJuliano praised Tahiliani as \u201csomeone who does her homework,\u201d but predicted the mayor would block her reappointment. \u201cCarlo does not like her, and Carlo can\u2019t control her. It\u2019s all about control for this mayor\u2014it really is. It\u2019s just as simple as that,\u201d said Juliano, \u201cThis is going to come down to politics. Carlo is going to get his way.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be very liked\u201dMore than 70% of Everett\u2019s students are considered low-income by the state, and more than a third are English language learners. Rosy Torres, who is Hispanic, serves on the Parent Teacher organization at the Madeline English school where her son is in the fifth grade. She refers to Tahiliani as \u201ca very empowering individual.\u201d\u201cChange is always hard. And it makes people feel uncomfortable, especially when we\u2019re talking about race and the underserved population,\u201d said Torres. \u201dIt\u2019s something that goes with the territory. You\u2019re not going to be very liked.\u201d 17-year-old Thalia Patino Molano, a junior at Everett High School, said she\u2019s watched all of the school committee meetings over the past three years. She said Tahiliani returned students' emails, and had made students of color feel heard.\u201cShe has gone out of her way to connect with students on her own,\u201d Molano said. Not having a vote: \u201cA gunfight without a gun\u201dBefore Tahiliani\u2019s tenure, the mayor held only an honorary role on the school committee. But in 2021, the city council changed the city charter to allow the mayor to have a vote\u2014a move that has been questioned by the school committee attorney Robert Galvin, in part because it was done without a public hearing. It is not unusual for mayors to hold a voting position on a school committee. And in a city council meeting late last month, the mayor defended the charter change, saying it was no different than having responsibility for the police or fire chief. And he further likened not having a vote to going into \"a gunfight without a gun.\"But some of Tahiliani's supporters saw it as a decisive turn against Tahiliani.In recent school committee meetings, several Everett residents have stood at the public microphone to urge the school committee to renew Tahiliani\u2019s contract. \u201cPolitics should be set aside, personal differences,\u201d said Everett resident Bill Thompson in one meeting. \u201cThis ain't a personality club. if someone does a good job, they should be recognized for that and rewarded.\u201d",

        "body": "For more than two hundred years, March 5 has been known as the anniversary of the Boston Massacre in the City of Boston. But on Sunday, the city marked the day as Crispus Attucks Commemoration Day in honor of the man who is historically regarded as the first person killed by British shots on March 5, 1770. It\u2019s a move that comes as the city aims to grapple with its own past and give a better picture of who Attucks was. At an event on Thursday announcing the official commemoration, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu remarked that the narratives of the day often portrayed Attucks as white, erasing his mixed African and Native American heritage. \u201cErasing the fact that a formerly enslaved man faced down British muskets for our nation\u2019s freedom,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd erasing the historical fact that it was the courage of a person of color that stoked the flames of this revolution.\u201dWu said that the acknowledgement of March 5 as Crispus Attucks Commemoration Day is in the spirit of the city\u2019s new reparations task force, saying that that work must begin with a \u201crecognition of the full truth of our history, the kind of truth on which meaningful healing and repair can finally be built.\u201dThe move was applauded by Haroon Rashid with the Friends of Crispus Attucks Association, who said at Thursday\u2019s event that many historians have recognized Attucks\u2019 contributions. \u201cHowever, in the 21st century, few political leaders have publicly stated the importance of knowing that a man of African and American Indigenous descent became popularly known as the first to defy and the first to die for American independence,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd his name was Crispus Attucks.\u201dOn Sunday, at the Old State House, one program focused on the impact of the many forms of political violence from the state. Nathaniel Sheidley, president and CEO of Revolutionary Spaces, said that while they didn\u2019t know that Crispus Attucks Commemoration Day would coincide with that programming when they were planning it, they have been trying to center Attucks in their telling of the Boston Massacre for a while now. He said that the commemoration is important not just for Attucks\u2019 legacy, but for Boston. \u201cI think that one of the challenges that we face as a city is to tell the story of our city\u2019s role in the nation\u2019s founding in a way that allows all of our residents to see themselves reflected in that story and to feel a sense of pride in it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Attucks is a really critical figure. He reminds us that Boston has always been a diverse place. And that people at all levels of our society have been contributors to our journey together across 250 years.\u201dSheidley also pointed out that while the city is officially recognizing a day to honor Attucks, the idea of a Crispus Attucks Day goes back all the way to the 1850s, when Black abolitionists chose to the use the anniversary of the Boston Massacre to make a statement about slavery. In the 20th century, the Boston Equal Rights League used the day to talk about the contributions of Black Bostonians and Americans. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s important that we recognize that this moment of inflection, kind of official blessing of the idea of Crispus Attucks Day, is thanks to many who have been advocating for this for a long time,\u201d he said. One of the speakers at the Old State House on Sunday was Charlot Lucien, founder of the Haitian Artists Assembly of Massachusetts. He said that there are a couple of reasons why recognizing Attucks is important. First, he said there is the imperative to acknowledge the contributions of Black people to the American Revolution. \u201cSo, had we erased Crispus Attucks in such a way that his name wasn\u2019t known, his face wasn\u2019t known, it would have been a missed opportunity for history and for the U.S. to embrace the richness of what happened in the U.S.,\u201d he said. He also tied the violence inflicted upon Attucks to violence that has historically been inflicted upon Black people across the world.\u201cAnd we need to relate a massacre in Boston to massacres that took place in other places and countries and states where Boston residents migrated from,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, this interconnectedness that can be promoted through this should not be underestimated. It has value for Boston, it has value for Boston communities and for any other state or country that at some point relates to Boston through either migration, immigration or through history.\u201d",

        "body": "Students of Everett High School walked out of class on Thursday in protest of the Everett School Committee's decision not to renew the district superintendent\u2019s contract. Approximately 100 students marched to Everett City Hall, chanting in support of Superintendent Priya Tahiliani, to demand the school committee reverse its decision and extend her contract.\u201cIt's just upsetting to see that they kicked out the one woman of color who has actually been putting in a lot of help for the community,\u201d said Ezra Rosario, an Everett High School alumni. \u201cShe's been very proactive. But our own mayor is only proactive when it looks good on his own.\u201dTahiliani, a woman of Indian origin, was the first person of color to hold the job of superintendent for the district. She was appointed to the position in late 2019 and began in the role the next year. She has frequently been at odds with Mayor Carlo DeMaria during her tenure. Despite her receiving positive performance reviews from school committee members, DeMaria has wanted her out. Last year, Tahiliani filed a complaint with the state against DeMaria, alleging he subjected her to \u201cblatant and overt acts of discrimination and retaliation.\u201d The mayor has denied these charges.More than 80% of students who attend Everett Public Schools are people of color, while about 89% of the district's teachers are white. Tahiliani alleged that after hiring minority candidates, DeMaria accused her of \u201cracism\u201d because he felt that she was excluding white people from open positions.Riley Avelar, a senior at Everett High School, also serves as the student representative for the Everett School Committee. She said she attended Monday's meeting where Tahiliani was voted out.\u201cI felt very unheard,\u201d she said. \u201cOur city is minority majority. We live in Massachusetts, a minority majority district. It only makes sense that we have a woman that represents us, that relates to the students and that they can feel connected to.\u201dJanene Johnson, a paraprofessional for Everett Public Schools.

        "body": "The MBTA will slow trains across the entire system starting immediately because of safety concerns, agency officials announced late Thursday night. The Red, Orange, Blue, and Green Lines will have speed restrictions, with trains not exceeding 10-25 miles an hour, depending on the location. MBTA officials did not release specifics about where the 10 mph zones would be. Normally speed limits vary by line but top out at 40 mph.The restrictions are \u201cthe result of findings following a recent site visit of the Red Line between Ashmont and Savin Hill by the Department of Public Utilities,\u201d MBTA officials said in a short statement. \u201cThese actions will add additional travel time for people taking the T. The MBTA apologizes in advance for these inconveniences.\u201dThe new restrictions make the entire system a slow zone, under the MBTA\u2019s definition. The MBTA has been running trains with speed restrictions over some parts of the system because of track work and safety concerns over months, notably on sections of the Orange Line after they reopened following a 30-day shutdown in August and September. On top of that, the agency announced other disruptions Friday morning: Shuttle buses replaced the Mattapan trolley along the entirety of its route, from Mattapan Square to Ashmont, until just after 8 a.m. Friday; and a power outage meant Blue Line trains were replaced with shuttle buses between Maverick and Suffolk Downs. On Thursday, the MBTA\u2019s chief safety officer, Ronald Ester, Jr., told the MBTA\u2019s board that the Department of Public Utilities, which oversees the MBTA, found a few pressing issues. \u201cThe DPU identified several issues that resulted in some immediate action letters being issued to the MBTA,\u201d Ester said. \u201cThey were: Priority 1one track conditions, third rail insulators, electrical access boxes on the right of way, headlight operation within the tunnels, PPE compliance and safety briefings.\u201d Commuters Friday mornings responded to the slowdowns with a mixture of frustration and resignation.\u201cI would love to see the T function better because I think it\u2019s important to have a system like this. So many people rely on it,\u201d said Laura Hewlett, on her way to work as a teacher. \u201cI rely on it too. But I\u2019d love to know that it goes faster than me running. MBTA officials will hold a 10 a.m. press conference about the new speed restrictions.",

        "body": "For most basketball teams, success begins on the hardwood. For Harvard women\u2019s basketball this year, it may have started on the Charles River. Last fall, after a pre-season practice had wrapped up, first-year head coach Carrie Moore took her team out with Harvard women\u2019s lightweight rowing team to get a taste of navigating as a team on the water. Unfortunately, the conditions weren\u2019t the best. \u201cIt was, like, freezing and raining and we had just had practice and [Moore was] like, \u2018All right, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go to the river!\u2019\u201d said senior guard and captain Maggie McCarthy, who had never been rowing before. Moore \u2014 who herself had also never rowed before \u2014 admits that she was scared. But the rowers, who were sprinkled among the basketball players in the boats, assured them that the odds of tipping over were low. After that, the reason for the trip started to come through. \u201cI think you learn a lot on the boat,\u201d Moore said. \u201cJust in terms of it\u2019s not an individual sport by any means. If one person is off at all in terms of their technique, the boat is shifting left or right. The balance has to be perfect.\u201dIt\u2019s not the typical exercise for a basketball program that for 40 seasons was led by Kathy Delaney-Smith, after whom the head coaching position at Harvard is named. But in her first year as skipper, Moore has steered the Crimson\u2019s ship to the Ivy League tournament with a 16-10 record in her first year, two wins away from an automatic berth in the NCAA tourney. For Moore, it\u2019s all part of the plan as she aims to keep Harvard on the course Delaney-Smith set \u2014 and even go beyond. It would be natural for just about anyone to be intimidated when trying to fill the big shoes of Delaney-Smith. Over her four decades at Harvard, she racked up 630 wins, winning nearly 70% of her games in the Ivy League along the way. But for Moore, who came to Harvard from the University of Michigan, that torch wasn\u2019t a burden. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I necessarily have ever felt it as pressure,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI think, if anything, I just see it as a tremendous opportunity. Because she proved that you can win at a very high level here. Which means that it\u2019s possible for us to do what we want to do.\u201dFor players like senior guard and captain McKenzie Forbes, one of the things that helped with the transition is that Moore made a lasting first impression.\u201cI feel like the person we got that day is like the same Coach Moore that we have to this day, and I think everyone can appreciate that,\u201d Forbes said. \u201cAnd like feel that when you\u2019re meeting someone new, you can kind of like get that vibe of like, \u2018OK, what kind of person are they?\u2019 And I think she\u2019s very authentic, very genuine with us.\u201dOn the court, the seeds of that authenticity are on full display. During the regular season finale against Dartmouth at Harvard\u2019s Lavietes Pavilion, Moore roamed the sidelines, her hands in her pockets, picking up every little detail and pulling players to the side for quick conversations the moment they stepped off the court.Even though the Big Green hadn\u2019t won an Ivy League game all year, Moore coached with the focus you'd expect of someone in the Final Four. Harvard would go on to win in a 64-40 route. It\u2019s the kind of attention to detail that Harvard will need as it heads into the Ivy League Tournament. But Moore\u2019s core mantra of \u201cBelieve It\u201d has the team feeling like they can run the table even as they face Columbia, the only Ivy League team Harvard hasn\u2019t beaten this year.\u201cThis whole season, we\u2019ve had a lot of ups and downs and changing of the lineups with different injuries, different players being out. But she\u2019s always like, \u2018Believe It,\u2019\u201d McCarthy said with a snap of her finger. \u201cAll we have is all we need,\u201d Forbes added. Over the course of the season, Moore\u2019s learned a lot. One of the main lessons she\u2019s come to understand is just how much patience the profession requires. She wants to hang banners and doesn\u2019t want to settle for being third or fourth in the conference. She wants to recruit players who can change the trajectory of the program, and she hopes to make them into better people and players. Moore knows that\u2019s coming. But if basketball is anything like rowing down a river, then even the best coaches have to get used to the water first.\u201cI\u2019m a Taurus and I\u2019m extremely stubborn. And it\u2019s incredibly hard for me to not have it all right now,\u201d Moore said. \u201cBut I think I\u2019ve learned that the lessons and the enjoyment is in the journey, not necessarily the destination. But we\u2019ll get there.\u201d",

        "body": "While many schools in Boston like to tout their diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, an LGBTQIA+ student task force at Boston University took a closer look at their own university's efforts. They were shocked by what they found. Out of 46 peer schools, including Harvard, MIT, Boston College, Tufts and Northeastern, BU ranked last in LGBTQ+ support communities and academic resources. To address this, the task force recommended the creation of a new student resource center \u2014 and BU did just that. Christa Rose, BU student and co-founder of the task force, joined All Things Considered host Arun Rath to discuss the student-led effort to make Boston University more inclusive. This transcript has been lightly edited.Arun Rath: So I understand the task force came together in the spring of last year, but take us back a little bit further and tell us more about what prompted the creation of the task force. I laid out those numbers at the beginning, but give us a sense of what that meant.Christa Rose: As you mentioned, our task force formed last spring in response to the lack of institutional inquiry into the experiences, concerns and needs of LGBTQIA+ students. So in 2018, BU actually charged an LGBTQIA+ task force for faculty and staff, and they were explicitly told not to look at the experiences and needs of students. That task force led to the creation of the LGBTQIA+ Center for Faculty and Staff. While a parallel task force was rumored to be created around the same time, four years went by, and none ever was. So using the 2018 final report of the LGBTQIA+ task force for faculty and staff as a model, we decided to form our own task force by students, for students. Unlike the 2018 task force, ours was not officially charged by the university. In terms of timeline, from February to October of 2022, we launched an inquiry into the climate for LGBTQIA+ BU students and then compiled their findings and 16 recommendations to improve the climate into a 126-page report that was delivered to the president and provost in November of 2022. Rath: In putting together that substantial report, how did you deploy to find this out? What were the research methods that you used to make sure you were hearing from everyone on campus?Rose: We knew that the issues that LGBTQ+ students were facing were really multifaceted, so we wanted to make sure that we took a multifaceted approach to collect data on the climate. We really wanted to use a research-driven academic approach to advocacy, given that BU is a research-driven academic institution. We felt that they would be very responsive to that, and they would like to see the data. That approach included a climate survey for LGBTQ+ students. We also had an additional survey for these students to share their satisfaction \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 with the availability and accessibility of all-gender bathrooms on campus. We also held interviews with the LGBTQ+ center directors of peer and peer-plus institutions, including Tufts, Northeastern, Harvard, MIT and UMass Amherst. We conducted dozens of interviews with BU stakeholders who were either LGBTQ+ themselves or in a student support role \u2014 whether they were in health services or orientation, or the Center for Career Development \u2014 just to try to get a sense of what efforts were already in place to support LGBTQ+ students. Lastly, we had two comparative landscape analyses. One looked at criteria related to institutional LGBTQ+ support, and then another looked specifically at the academic side of things, looking at women's gender and sexuality studies programs and departments across the peer and peer-plus institutions. Rath: Tell us about the findings of the report and how that informed the kind of services you thought the centers should provide.Rose: Our findings show that, on average, LGBTQ+ BU students do not believe that BU's administrators provide a welcoming environment for LGBTQ+ students and that, on average, LGBTQ+ BU students are dissatisfied with the level of LGBTQ+ resources currently available at BU. And even further, 38% of students do not know of any LGBTQ+ BU resources available to them. Overall, our findings really show that the youth climate has taken a toll on LGBTQ+ students' mental and physical health, social life and academic performance. Our report makes several recommendations for what we hope the center would provide with those findings in mind. Some of those recommendations include assistance connecting students to culturally competent support resources, guidance and financial assistance with student-led advocacy and other initiatives, an emergency fund, mentorship opportunities, educational workshops and a physical space for students to hang out and study with their LGBTQIA+ peers. We really hope that, in addition to community building and having this physical space for community, policy advocacy and structural change are an integral part of the center's duties and would also emphasize throughout the report the necessity of an intersectional center that prioritizes the inclusivity and safety of our BIPOC [Black, Indigenous and people of color], trans and gender-nonconforming students. Rath: Building on that, the report addresses two main themes: improving visibility, communication and community, as well as making sure the overall student experience is more equitable and inclusive. What kind of changes would need to take place?Rose: In addition to this center, there really needs to be a university-wide climate shift. There need to be efforts across the entire university that are addressing the concerns and really aligning themselves with inclusive practices to better support LGBTQ+ students. We see the center as a critical first step in giving LGBTQ+ students the institutional support and visibility they deserve. But it really needs to be an effort that takes place across the university, split up based on department centers or offices. We really wanted to tailor our feedback to ensure that these specific centers and offices and departments knew exactly what they need to do to support LGBTQ+ students so that there was never a question of, \"OK, I see what some of the issues are, but what can we do?\" Rath: What kind of reception have you had so far from the administration and the faculty? Rose: In November of 2022, we met with the president, provost and interim dean of students. We were really nervous going into that meeting and unsure what to expect because up until then, we had historically been met with a lot of resistance, especially from the dean of students' office, regarding our advocacy efforts and bringing concerns that LGBTQ+ students have and offering recommendations on how to address those. So going into this meeting, we really prepared for all kinds of scenarios, but we were actually super pleasantly surprised by how receptive and action-oriented they were from the start. President [Robert A.] Brown was basically like, \"OK, we're going to create a center. This is a no-brainer for us. Where do you want it to be?\"There was a moment of just stunned silence from our task force because that was the question, maybe one of the very few questions that we were not anticipating for them to ask. We were, as I mentioned earlier, anticipating some resistance to our recommendations. But that's really not what we were met with at all, which was really, really surprising and great.",

        "body": "State health officials are warning residents against consuming native fish caught at 13 state parks because of elevated levels of PFAS in the water.The Massachusetts Department of Public Health issued new health advisories this week after recent testing found wild fish in those parks contained higher than recommended levels of a group of synthetic chemicals known as PFAS. The fish tested contained varying levels of PFAS, so the advisories range from eating no native fish from some bodies of water to no more than two meals a week of native fish from others. PFAS, an abbreviation for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of synthetic chemicals manufactured and used in consumer products and industries worldwide. Exposure to certain PFAS have been linked to changes in liver and kidney function, changes in thyroid hormone and cholesterol levels, and immune system effects. Some studies also suggest an increased risk of developing cancer following long-term exposure to elevated levels of some PFAS.Marc Nascarella, the director of the environmental toxicology program at the Department of Public Health, said other state and federal agencies have PFAS testing programs, but his department's testing prioritized areas that are popular for fishing and swimming. None of the bodies of water tested were deemed unsafe for swimming.\"We actually sampled 146 individual fish at each water body,\" Nascarella explained. \"And we sampled it the way you would eat your dinner, not the whole fish, but the fillet.\"Click here to see all freshwater fish advisories, including those for mercury and other hazards.Ashland Reservoir in Ashland: Limit all fish to one meal per month.Chicopee Reservoir in Chicopee: Do not eat any fish.Dennison Lake in Winchendon: Limit all fish to two meals per month.Dunn Pond in Gardner: Limit all fish to one meal per month.Fearing Pond in Plymouth: Limit all fish to two meals per week.Houghtons Pond in Milton: Limit all fish to one meal per week.Lake Cochituate in Natick: Do not eat any American eel, and limit other species to one meal per month.Lake Quinsigamond in Worcester: Limit all fish to one meal per two-month period.Pearce Lake in Saugus: Limit all fish to two meals per week.Pequot Pond in Westfield: Limit all fish to one meal per two-month period.Walden Pond in Concord: Limit all fish to two meals per month.Wallum Lake in Douglas: Limit all fish to two meals per month.Watsons Pond in Taunton: Limit all fish to one meal per week.While the advisories apply to all native game fish, they do not apply to stocked trout, which are raised in one of five fish hatcheries and then released into roughly 500 bodies of water across the state. The Department of Public Health said stocked trout are not likely to spend enough time in a lake or pond to become contaminated.Todd Richards, assistant director of fisheries at Mass Wildlife, said the state encourages people to fish and currently has about 200,000 licensed anglers. But he noted that while trout from the state's long-running stocking program may be safe, PFAS levels in wild fish aren't likely to go down anytime soon.\"The key to restoring these water bodies is pollution prevention and stopping the source,\" he explained. \"We do know that once PFAS stop accumulating in the waters, over time those water bodies can be restored. It's taken decades for a lot of these water bodies to return to levels where fish are safe to eat because of mercury.\" Deirdre Cummings, legislative director at MASSPIRG, said she's not surprised PFAS levels in wild fish exceed recommended levels in Massachusetts waters. She applauds the Department of Public Health for testing for the chemicals, calling it a step in the right direction. \"This is an urgent problem,\" she said, \"and unless we can turn off the tap and stop these chemicals getting into our environment, this problem will get worse and escalate over time.\" Cummings says MASSPIRG supports a bill that was recently filed by state Sen. Julian Cyr and state Rep. Kate Hogan, which calls for banning the use of PFAS statewide by 2030.",

        "body": "It is simply a fact, repeated in study after study locally and nationwide: Small minority-owned businesses struggle to get bank loans. They may not have strong credit histories or valuable collateral to put up for a loan, and they may not have relationships with banks that can help them get in the door.The Equity Alliance for Business \u2014 a new program assembled by Eastern Bank and several non-profits that serve minority-and LGBTQ-owned businesses \u2014 is hoping to change that by radically lowering the barriers to bank loans for disadvantaged entrepreneurs.The idea is that minority/woman/LGBTQ+ entrepreneurs who are being supported and trained by groups including the Black Economic Council of Massachuetts and the Massachusetts LGBT Chamber of Commerce can use those relationships to lower the requirements for a small business loan from Eastern Bank.\u201cFor loans, up to $100,000, when the business is partnering with one of our community referral organizations, that they've either gone through a technical assistance program or they have been doing other training and development with those nonprofits \u2026 we have actually eliminated the minimum credit score requirement,\u201d said Quincy Miller, Eastern Bank president.Under federal \u201cfair banking\u201d rules, all borrowers are required to meet the same criteria for getting a loan, but Miller said that winds up creating unfair outcomes, because, for example, a minority entrepreneur may not have the credit history or collateral that a white borrower with generational wealth can bring to the table. The result of applying identical criteria is a disparity in who gets loans.Miller said it took Eastern Bank a year to prove this disparity to federal regulators, which allowed them to open a \u201cspecial purpose credit program,\u201d creating lower thresholds for disadvantaged businesses to qualify for the same loans \u2014 including reducing and in some cases doing away with a credit score requirement. That, he said, \u201cis pretty groundbreaking.\u201dThe key, Miller said, is working with partner organizations that train and mentor small businesses, and that can provide a kind of \u201ccharacter reference\u201d that the businesses are ready for the financing. Those nonprofits \u201cspend every day helping to invest back into women-owned businesses, community businesses of color, etc.\u201d he said. \u201cThey have those relationships. We're leveraging the character aspect of credit, which is an important aspect, not just the numbers part of credit.\u201dKarla Morales, who runs a Marlborough-based cleaning service called Your Home Detox and a website called Bohio Clean to connect other cleaners to new clients, is the first to get a loan under the new program. Morales \u2014 who currently employs 10 people \u2014 said her vision is to run an eco-friendly cleaning service and also \u201cethically connect\u201d potential customers and cleaning service providers, to help \u201censure that people who work in the cleaning industry are getting paid for the work that they do.\u201d But she first needed financing to keep that vision moving forward.\u201cWe were constantly denied by other banks,\u201d Morales said. Because she didn't have credit history at the time and since the business was new and did not have a track record, \u201cit was difficult for me to get capital.\u201d Morales got a $100,000 loan that she plans to use for sales and marketing, as well as to have a cushion to cover costs when commercial customers are slow paying their bills.Daniel Vida\u00f1a, president of Innovation Studio, a local small-business incubator, said the new credit offering from Eastern Back is a big step forward, but it is not a magic solution for everyone.Vida\u00f1a said that even Eastern can\u2019t give a loan to an entrepreneur who has not registered their business, set up a company bank account or who hasn\u2019t been sending invoices to customers. These are things that the community organizations like his can help entrepreneurs put in place, so that they are ready to go to a bank like Eastern for funding \u2014 and they can come to the bank with the endorsement of a trusted community partner.Eastern\u2019s loan package \u201cis not a solution for everybody, but it clearly clears the decks for some people who are almost there,\u201d he said. Vida\u00f1a said he is not aware of other banks that are working on this kind of credit flexibility. \u201cI applaud Eastern Bank for doing that because I think it's a long time coming,\u201d he said. And he says \u201cthey have the right relationships with the other organizations and vice versa to essentially support the unique needs [of companies] that are going to be part of this process.\u201dBut he cautions that \u201cthe time frame for us to know whether this is an impactful approach is going to be a while.\u201d One of the partner organizations in the new alliance is Mill Cities Community Investments, a Lawrence-based nonprofit lender that already offers loans specifically tailored to traditionally underserved communities. Executive Director Glynn Lloyd said it is important for commercial banks like Eastern to look for new ways to get capital to minoirty-owned business. \u201cThe credit system has discrimination built into it,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cFor a lot of Black and brown people, the credit scores reflect some institutional racism.\u201dSo Lloyd says he is excited about being part of Eastern\u2019s new alliance \u201cbecause this is an example of where you have a really untraditional bank trying to figure out how do we get debt products out to our folks that have been historically kind of shut out.\u201d",

        "body": "The church in North Thetford is bigger than you\u2019d expect. There\u2019s a large hall with a stage. Two kitchens. Two grand pianos. A pipe organ. A bell tower. And, of course, the sanctuary. It has curved wooden pews and tall, stained glass windows.Kenya Lazuli is now in charge of all this space. \"I still come in here, and I'm like, \u2018What, we get to use this, whenever we want?\u2019\" she said, as she walked through the sanctuary.Lazuli is from Corinth and works for the Northeast Farmers of Color Land Trust, which took ownership of the building at the beginning of the year.She\u2019s converting a sunny meeting room into a library, a basement room into a tool lending library. She plans to renovate the 1950s-era kitchen into a commercial-grade space. She found a popcorn machine on Craigslist for an upcoming movie night.Despite these changes, Lazuli said the church already has most everything they could need.\"It has all the chairs and tables even,\" she said. \"All the bathrooms you need, it\u2019s accessible for mobility devices. It\u2019s set up already to be a community center.\"The community center she's building is still in its infancy. It doesn\u2019t yet have a name, and they had their first public events this month \u2014 an open house and a tool drive. The vision for this space is clear, though.\"There are lots of places to gather that white-led organizations either own or run that don't feel safe or welcoming to communities of color,\" Lazuli said.\"The whole point of this place is to be welcoming to communities of color, and anyone else who needs a space to gather or wants to have an event or anything.\"For much of its history, the church has been a place for community gatherings. Throughout the 20th century, it hosted music and folk dancing classes, buffet suppers, Halloween parties, and hymn festivals that drew crowds of over four hundred people. Part of the appeal was where it\u2019s located.\"There was a store in town, sawmill in town, all that kind of stuff. So people drove by it, and saw it, and went to it,\" said Brigid Farrell, a retired principal from Norwich and the part-time pastor of the church.Farrell says over the years, the community changed. The mills closed. I-91 went in. A bridge that connected the town to New Hampshire came out. And younger generations stopped going to church as much.When Farrell came to the United Church of Thetford five years ago, it was no longer a bustling place. About 30 people regularly attended services, and they wanted to make a change.The church had enough money to maintain the building, but after lots of deliberation, they decided that wasn\u2019t what they really cared about.\u201cIt was like, \u2018Well, what is God calling us to do?\u2019\u201d said Farrell. \u201cOnce we got to that point, it really wasn't a hard decision to get rid of the building.\u201dWhat they wanted was to have the building serve the community. It couldn't be converted to housing units, and they didn't want to sell it \u2014 it's worth about $150,000. So they started looking for a new owner. They reached out to arts organizations and posted messages on a town listserv. That\u2019s how, eventually, they connected with Lazuli, who pitched using the building as a community center.\u201cBecause this space is here and not being used, it's like finding a secret treasure,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just need to open it up.\u201dFor her, the church is the start of a much bigger project she dreamed up years ago: For every town in Vermont to designate a piece of healthy land for stewardship by people of color.Lazuli does not expect to reach this goal in her lifetime, but she says the effort feels essential.\u201cThis project is based in reparations, and beginning \u2014 just beginning, scratching the surface \u2014 of a way to repair for past harm that has been perpetrated against people of color, specifically Black and Indigenous people in this country, but also in the state,\u201d she said. \u201cThis state is my context. So that\u2019s why this project is happening here. But there\u2019s a lot here.\u201dThe church in North Thetford is their first land donation. Lazuli did not originally expect the project to include a church, but she says it makes sense that their first piece of land is for everyone.As for the congregation, they\u2019ll keep meeting in the sanctuary once a week. They\u2019re looking forward to see the building used for more than a couple hours on Sundays.Lexi Krupp is a corps member for Report for America, a nonprofit national service program that places journalists in local newsrooms to report on under-covered issues and regions.

        "body": "The Boston City Council Wednesday approved proposals to implement rent control and restructure the city\u2019s planning and development agency, advancing two major pieces of Mayor Michelle Wu\u2019s legislative agenda forward to state lawmakers.Both measures passed 11-2, with Councilors Frank Baker and Erin Murphy voting against them. In a rare, post-vote media appearance, Wu said the council \"delivered a strong message\" with the rent control approval.\"The city of Boston needs the tools to address our housing crisis,\" Wu said. \"We hear from residents across every single neighborhood just how dire it is and we see families who are getting pushed out of the communities that they grew up in and helped to build. This is affecting everything from how our businesses and economy can recover to our school enrollment and the stability of every part of our neighborhoods.\"The topic of rent control was controversial even before the city began discussing Wu\u2019s proposal in earnest. The mayor is seeking to usurp a 1990s statewide ban on the policy and restore a local form of rent control in Boston. Even though a recent poll suggests the policy is popular among likely voters statewide, the Massachusetts Legislature has shown little appetite for taking up the issue. \"The goal, as always, is to be in a conversation with our city government, with our residents, with our state government,\" Wu said when asked about the measure's likelihood of success on Beacon Hill. \"We all represent the same constituents, we all hear from the same families who are struggling to hang on in the city. ... I think we all share an urgency in knowing that this can't stand for Boston.\"Wu has largely been alone as a city executive championing the issue. Mayors from several of Massachusetts' largest cities, including Cambridge, Fall River and Lynn, have indicated they have no plans to pursue their own rent control proposals. So far, only the city of Somerville, which previously had a rent control policy, has begun exploring a local option.Somerville City Council President Ben Ewen-Campen said the city's proposal is in its early stages, but they hope to present a finalized version for approval on Beacon Hill this fall. He noted that Somerville has previously sought \u2014 and failed \u2014 to bring back rent control. But he is more hopeful this time around.\"I think we're at a really important point where we have a governor who has indicated that she is supportive of municipalities taking this step,\" Ewen-Campen said.He said he considers rent control a reasonable approach to help working class people live in the city.\"The extreme position is what we have now,\" he explained, \"where some real estate investor or some LLC can buy up an apartment building and jack up the rent 30%, 40%, 100% and just evict people who have been in Somerville for years and have kids in the schools.\"In Boston, Wu\u2019s rent control proposal has upset both those with interests in the real estate sector and progressive housing advocates. The MassLandlords trade group and the Greater Boston Real Estate Board have publicly lobbied against Wu\u2019s proposal, arguing that it would stifle housing production and worsen the city\u2019s housing crisis. MassLandlords also argued Wu\u2019s proposal, which exempts owners who live with their tenants and own six units or less, leaves out landlords who don\u2019t live with their tenants, but still reside within the city of Boston. Councilor Michael Flaherty proposed an ultimately unsuccessful amendment to address that concern. Multiple councilors spoke against it, arguing that there\u2019s a distinction between landlords who live with their renters and those who own investment properties.Meanwhile, housing advocates wanted to tighten portions of Wu\u2019s plan by lowering the annual increase beyond 10% in high inflation years, or the rate of inflation plus 6% in most other years.Wu\u2019s proposal exempts college-operated dormitories and residential buildings for 15 years beginning from the date of their certificate of occupancy. It would also establish eviction protections and bar a landlord from recovering possession of a unit unless a housing court approves. Wu\u2019s agency restructure plan would, if approved by the Legislature and Gov. Maura Healey, formally dissolve the Boston Redevelopment Authority, the official entity created in 1957 to oversee the city\u2019s development activities in the era of urban renewal. The measure would codify a focus on three key planning principles \u2014 resilience, affordability and equity \u2014 and would also dissolve the partner Economic Development Industrial Corporation, established in 1971 to lead local economic development activities.Wu said Wednesday she expects \"strong\" support for the measure at the State House.The BRA began doing business as the Boston Planning and Development Agency in 2016 when then-Mayor Marty Walsh made a $600,000 bid to rebrand the agency to shed its reputation as inefficient and overly responsive to the desires of developers. Wu\u2019s proposal would maintain the rebranded name.Councilors approved one amendment to Wu\u2019s plan that maintains urban renewal land disposition agreements, area-specific restrictions that spell out what can and cannot be built in a given place.

        "body": "If you attend a community college in Massachusetts this summer or fall, you will no longer be required to have a COVID-19 vaccine \u2014 with some exceptions. Since January 2022, the state\u2019s 15 community colleges have mandated students and staffers receive the vaccine if they\u2019re attending classes in person or working on campus. After this spring semester, though, the schools will lift that mandate.\u201cWe felt like it had served its purpose. It had kept our communities and our campuses safe,\u201d said David Podell, president of Mass Bay Community College and chair of the state\u2019s Community College Council of Presidents. Podell said the schools are \u201cfollowing the science\" and that it\u2019s probably not necessary to continue to require the vaccine. \"The rates of COVID infection are low in our communities, and we felt it was safe now to drop the mandate,\u201d he said.Many community college students studying health care also work in hospitals and nursing homes. The schools say those students will have to follow requirements of their clinical placements or internships.Among higher education institutions, the pandemic has hit community college enrollment the hardest, with more than 860,000 fewer students nationwide since fall 2019 to fall 2022, according to the National Student Clearinghouse. Massachusetts alone has more than 10,000 fewer community college students.Podell said he doesn\u2019t think lifting the mandate will make a difference on enrollment one way or the other. He points to Mass Bay, where enrollment last fall was even with the previous year \u2014 and this spring it went up 6.5%. \u201cThat's before the change of the vaccination requirement, so we're seeing a turn,\u201d Podell said. \u201cIt will vary from one community college to another, but overall, I think, we're seeing finally the change in people's behavior coming out of the pandemic, independent of the issue of the [vaccine] requirement.\u201dWhile the vaccine will no longer be required, the community college presidents say they're strongly encouraging all members of their communities to stay up to date on their COVID-19 vaccinations.",

        "body": "Members of the Massachusetts Black and Latino Legislative Caucus have thrown their support behind a state audit of the Massachusetts Convention Center Authority in response to allegations of racism and discrimination at the independent state authority. \u201cThe complaints filed by Black employees alleging discrimination in hiring, promotion, and working conditions, as well as the lack of diversity among the authority's top employees, are troubling,\u201d Executive Director Z\u00e1von Billups wrote in a statement on behalf of the caucus. \u201cThe fact that there is no diversity officer charged with creating opportunities for people of color is also a cause for concern.\u201d Over the past month, five employees filed formal complaints with the state attorney general alleging racial bias against employees, vendors and convention guests, including heightened security at Black-sponsored events and pay inequity among employees, according to reporting from The Boston Globe.The Massachusetts Convention Center Authority is one of a few independent authorities in state government that does not have a diversity officer. A Globe review also found no Black employees among the 25 highest-paid employees at the authority, including leadership. State Auditor Diana DiZoglio has launched an audit of the authority, roughly one month after the release of a previous audit into its past performance that identified \u201cseveral deficiencies\u201d in compliance with state contract laws. \u201cThe issues raised by The Boston Globe and Andrea Estes are concerning and fall precisely within the realm of objectives I have enumerated in my social justice and equity audit plan,\u201d DiZoglio said in a statement. Multiple employees of color sent an anonymous letter to Gov. Maura Healey in January, urging her to replace MCAA Executive Director David Gibbons and the rest of his leadership team. Healey\u2019s office is conducting its own investigation into the allegations. \u201cWhat has been raised and reported on is very concerning,\u201d Healey told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cWe're currently reviewing all of that.\u201d The Massachusetts Convention Center Authority \u201cstrongly refutes the assertions and the motivations behind them,\u201d according to a spokesperson for the authority. \u201cWe take seriously the claim that any employee, client or guest feels discriminated against, mistreated, or undervalued.\u201d The MCCA hired law firm Prince Lobel Tye LLP and principal attorney Walter Prince to \u201creview our policies and procedures at present and in the past, including the experience of employees of color within the organization and any negative experience that an attendee of color may have had at the BCEC or Hynes.\u201d The authority received formal notice of the audit, according to the spokesperson, and will be \u201cworking diligently\u201d with DiZoglio\u2019s office. In their anonymous letter to Healey, employees expressed concern about losing their jobs as a result of speaking out individually or drawing attention to cultural issues, according to the Globe. \u201cThis underscores the need for stronger protections for whistleblowers and for employers to create a culture of accountability and transparency,\u201d Billups wrote in his statement on behalf of the Black and Latino Caucus. \u201cThe allegations of racial discrimination at the [authority] are deeply concerning, and it is critical that the authorities take swift action to investigate and address these issues.\u201d Michael Curry, the former president of the NAACP Boston Branch, says he worked with David Gibbons to bring the NAACP national convention to Boston this summer. \u201cGibbons and I got together and said, 'We need to change Boston.' We proposed to the national NAACP bringing the convention here, and the convention is coming,\u201d Curry said in an interview with GBH News. \u201cI think that's a tremendous opportunity for [Gibbons] and the rest of his team to seize on that little victory, that relatively little victory, to then start getting big victories in systemic change within the Convention Center Authority.\u201dThis evaluation of the authority is an opportunity to investigate the lack of diversity among leadership at companies across the state, Curry said. \u201cThis is not unique to the Convention Center Authority. This is rampant throughout Massachusetts and particularly in Boston,\u201d Curry said. \u201cThe reality is, too many C-suites and too many organizations are predominantly white and male. We've not yet cracked the code on how we tap into talent; women and people of color who have tremendous talent to offer these organizations. Shame on us and shame on the convention center if we don't meet the moment.\u201d",

He\u2019s also a horticulturist, meaning he\u2019s an expert in anything that grows leaves and flowers. GBH's Morning Edition asked our audience for weather and gardening questions, and Dave graciously answered them on the air. This transcript has been edited for clarity.Have a gardening or weather question for meteorologist Dave Epstein? Tweet him @GrowingWisdom, email us at thewakeup@wgbh.org, or text 617-300-2008.We are quickly moving toward springtime. Could Dave talk about when is the best time to clean up the garden in spring to help support pollinators and garden health? \u2014Laura, via emailUntil nights are a bit warmer, pollinators can lay dormant in plants, Epstein said. Supporting them is easy: Wait a bit longer to clean things up.\u201cThe longer you can tolerate waiting, the better it is for the pollinators,\u201d Epstein said. \u201cUntil it really warms up, until we have nights which are well into the 40s, which probably doesn't happen until later on in April, some of the pollinators are still sleeping.\u201dFor instance: People who have perennials with long stocks in their yards often provide a winter home for solitary bees and other insects.\u201cIf you cut those down and chop them up and throw them away, you may be damaging the home for the little bee which was hanging out there all winter, or other sort of beneficial insects,\u201d Epstein said. \u201cSo that's why you want to leave it as long as possible. I have to admit I leave some of my garden, but some I\u2019ve got to uncover because things are emerging. So try to do as long as you can.\u201dIs it cold out lately, or is it just me being a baby? \u2014Morning Edition co-host Jeremy SiegelAfter unseasonably warm weather for most of the winter, Epstein said he welcomes 40-degree highs in March. People sometimes have odd expectations for March weather, he said.\u201cI think our expectation of this month is so unrealistic,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone's like, \u2018it\u2019s not supposed to be this cold.\u2019\u201dLooking ahead at the forecast, Epstein said Boston-area residents can expect highs in the 40s for the next week, with intermittent breeze and clouds, perhaps some precipitation. \u201cThere might be some rain, there might be a little snow. It's what March does,\u201d Epstein said. He offered some advice or anyone who may be weary of March. \u201cIt's what early spring is. I'm not telling people what to do, but if you embrace it and look at it and go: \u2018this is the transition, this is the light growing, in another couple of weeks we're going to be at 12 hours of daylight,\" he said. \"Birds are out there making the noise in the morning. If you look at the maple trees, they're beginning to open up, the red maples. The sap is flowing, small little bugs are starting to emerge. I mean, that's early spring. And if it happens slowly, that's great because that's what nature wants.\u201d",

        "body": "It had been a long 367 days since Russian forces invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022. But when members of Boston's Ukrainian community and their supporters flooded Copley Square on Sunday, they signaled their resolve to see Ukraine endure as a sovereign, independent nation\u2014no matter how long it takes.Bracing a bitter cold made worse by a February breeze, demonstrators carried signs along with blue and yellow flags, now recognized around the world as a symbol of resistance and solidarity. Vsevolod Petriv, president of the Boston branch of the Ukrainian Congress Committee of America, estimated that 2,000 people attended the rally. He said that the war in Ukraine is about autocracy versus democracy. And he was happy to see the solidarity of the Ukrainian diaspora evident in that struggle. \"Ukrainians are spread throughout the world due to all the different conflicts,\" he said. \"And all of these different pockets of Ukrainians are joining hands together. And that's pretty cool.\"Among the speakers at the rally was Rep. Stephen Lynch, who compared Russian president Vladimir Putin's efforts in Ukraine to those of Adolf Hitler in World War II. \"I think it's important for all of us to remember that this is not just about Ukraine,\" Lynch said. \"Ukraine stands at the frontline of democracy in Europe.\"Although she wasn't a speaker, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu issued a statement through a spokesperson proclaiming Sunday as Boston Ukraine Day. \"On this day and in solidarity with the people of Ukraine, I commend them for their strength, courage and bravery and do urge all citizens of the City of Boston to stand together in support of the Ukrainian people in this fight for freedom,\" the statement read. Sunday's crowd was a mix of people, including many who emigrated from the Eastern European country, people with ties to it and others who were there to support Ukraine on ideological grounds. Leonid Furman, 65, lives in Stoughton and came to the United States from Russia 31 years ago. He said he sees the war as something bigger than merely a fight for one country's independence.\"In my opinion, it's not the war just against Ukraine. It's a war against the whole West,\" he said. At the rally's end, demonstrators stepped inside Trinity Church for an exhibit, refreshments and a special service for Ukraine later in the afternoon. Outside, Dariella Yasyukevych, who lives in Lynn and came to the U.S. from Ukraine 15 years ago, said that the past year has been tough, with family members still in Ukraine. \"That means a lot to every Ukrainian,\" she said. \"And we appreciate that the whole world finally knows that Ukraine is not a part of Russia. That Ukraine's been independent for 31 years and that we exist, we have our culture, we have our food, our traditions, our language.\"She's hopeful for two things going forward: that Ukraine will win and that Russia will be held accountable for its actions.",

        "body": "Back in December, before she made the transition from governor-elect to governor, Maura Healey unequivocally told GBH News' Jim Braude that she'd break with past governors and not claim an exemption from Massachusetts' public records law.But now, if you go online to request public records from Healey's office, you're greeted by a message in which she does exactly that: \u201cBy law, records held by the Office of the Governor are not subject to the Massachusetts public records law.\u201d And while the governor's public records webpage promises that requests will be considered anyway on a case-by-case basis, just like under Healey's predecessor Charlie Baker, it also says that \"any unique obligations of the Governor's Office\" will be taken into account \u2014 a caveat that's a Healey innovation, and seems to give her an extra layer of insulation from public scrutiny.So what are the practical consequences of Healey's shift on transparency? And given the direction she's moved in, what are the chances she'll eventually make good on her promise to be more transparent than past governors? In this segment of Talking Politcs, Adam Reilly is joined by Samantha Gross of the Boston Globe and Mass Dump author Andrew Quemere, both of whom recently submitted records requests that were rebuffed by the Healey administration.Tell us what else you'd like to see on future shows as we continue Talking Politics each Friday.

        "body": "An inquest has begun into the fatal shooting of 20-year-old Sayed Faisal by a Cambridge police officer last month, according to a press release from Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan on Thursday. Ryan requested the independent investigation by a judge last month, a move that family members and local officials hope will offer clarity and transparency. Faisal was a 20-year-old UMass Boston student and Cambridge resident, who appeared to be having a mental health crisis when he was killed on Jan. 4. He allegedly approached officers with a knife and was shot. Barbara Dougan, legal director of the Massachusetts chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, is representing Faisal's family and said the family welcomes the inquest. Unlike a grand jury investigation, family members \u2014 and officers involved in the shooting \u2014 can be present for the process. Judges can summon witnesses and examine relevant documents, often in coordination with the district attorney. Inquests typically take several months to conclude, after which the district attorney reviews the judge\u2019s report and decides whether to pursue charges or not. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a process that's going to play out, a long-haul process that we're going to need all the support they can get,\u201d Dougan said. \u201cI guess if there's any goal, it\u2019s not only to get justice for their son, but to prevent any other family from going through something like this.\u201dIn Massachusetts, all officer-involved shootings are investigated by county district attorneys. Ryan\u2019s office has made it a practice of requesting inquests into fatal police shootings in Middlesex County since 2018. The killing of Faisal by Cambridge police stirred a strong community response, reported protests in Bangladesh and an ongoing response from the city\u2019s government. \u201cIt\u2019s a very frustrating thing that [the inquest] is going to take a couple of months,\u201d said Cambridge City Councilor Burhan Azeem. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of frustrations in the community that this has happened, and the police report and other things are not yet public. ... But all of the evidence, everything that people want to see, will be public at the end of the day. And I think that what is good and bad about our legal process is that we are very, very thorough. And so it takes a long time.\u201dAlso unlike a grand jury, at the end of an inquest, a detailed report and full transcript of the proceedings are made public. \u201cAn inquest is far more independent and leads to more transparency after the fact,\u201d Dougan said. \u201cI mean, during the investigation stage of the inquest, it's all closed to the public, but after the fact a report is made public. So there's more transparency, more independence, hopefully more accountability.\u201d Azeem outlined responses the city is taking, including the recent announcement of implementing a body camera program for police and alternative responses to emergency calls that involve people in a mental health crisis. \u201cWe\u2019re also not waiting for the monthslong inquest process to conclude,\u201d Azeem said. \u201cI personally don't use the word \u2018tragic\u2019 because it makes it seem as though there's nothing you could have done. And I do think that there are things that we can do and we are doing.\u201d Cambridge police spokesperson Jeremy Warnick told GBH News that the department has conducted a number of recent trainings. One in December 2022, the month before Faisal\u2019s killing, was \u201cdesigned to provide officers with more response options to help them de-escalate incidents\u201d involving mental health crises. He highlighted that officers regularly receive training on issues such as domestic violence, elder abuse and LGBTQ cultural competency. \u201cOur officers are trained and prepared to handle the evolving demands placed on them,\u201d Warnick said in an email. \u201cThere are a number of noteworthy trainings that CPD has been at the forefront of across the region and country.\u201d Warnick said regular training programs also included emphases on veterans and PTSD, fair and impartial policing and management of aggressive behavior. Azeem added that the city is exploring more non-lethal response options for police, including Tasers, which he says are currently not used by the department. \u201cWe are also looking at it in a different aspect as well, which is: how can we use increased mental health resources?\u201d Azeem said. \u201cYou know, police perhaps should not be the first line of defense for a mental health call. And if we can prevent these calls from even happening in the first place, that would be wonderful.\u201dDougan said Faisal\u2019s family is gratified that steps are being taken to decrease the likelihood of a similar deadly outcome with Cambridge police for someone in crisis. But, she added, that\u2019s not their focus. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to step in front of those folks who've already been working on this issue for years,\u201d Dougan said, \u201c[and] the family is not paying attention to body camera policies at this point. Other people are, which is good and we\u2019re glad they are. But they\u2019re just still trying to get through each day with this gaping hole in their lives, which is the loss of their only child.\u201d",

        "body": "A year ago today, Russia's military launched an invasion of Ukraine. It was shocking and frightening, especially for Ukrainians living abroad and watching the war unfold in their home country. That includes MIT student Sasha Horokh, who is director of the nonprofit Mriya and a volunteer with the Ukrainian Cultural Center of New England. They joined GBH Morning Edition hosts Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel to talk about the last year. This transcript has been lightly edited. Siegel: Sasha, you were born in Ukraine and lived in Kiev before coming to school in Massachusetts. And you flew home over the last year to deliver humanitarian aid in your home country. How have you seen things change in Ukraine over the last year? Horokh: That's a very good question, a pretty hard one. I think that one of the hardest things was to watch it from here, from the U.S. Because first, when you read the news about all the horrible things happening and especially about them happening right next to your home, right next to your family, about your friends dying \u2014 it's very hard to be living in a place where people just go on with their lives and somehow expect you to move on and go on with your life too. When I was in Ukraine, it was a lot easier. I spent summer there volunteering on the ground and since January it has been an Independent Activities Period in Ukraine. It is a period in MIT. So that's what I did. Being in the Ukraine is easy in the sense of, it gives you some sense of unity. And there actually was a lot of it over the last year. I feel that Ukrainian society very much united to stand for freedom and independence. And it shows in so many things: It shows in the way people treat each other, even outsiders, strangers. It shows in the way that people choose to speak to each other, both in terms of language and words they use. It also shows a lot in the way that people help each other whenever something happens. I think most people in Ukraine by now are either in the Ukrainian army defending the country or volunteering to do something to help defenders or people who are victims of Russian violence. Alston: Sasha, how have your loved ones back home been, and what's the past year been like for them? Horokh: It's been terrible. I lost many friends. There were like 10, but one by one over the last year.Alston: I'm sorry. Horokh: My family is alive, and I'm very thankful for that. My dad stays in Kiev. That's the capital of Ukraine. It's constantly bombed, as well as any other big cities. He is there alone because my mom and my younger sister are now refugees in the U.K. My grandparents are also in Kiev, and they cannot even move to the bomb shelter because my grandad is partially paralyzed. And my other grandparents are in Sumy, that's an eastern Ukrainian city. My grandma watched Russian tanks having a battle with the Ukrainian army on her street and she was watching it from her basement window. My almost 75-year-old grandad was biking five miles one way to the hospital and back because it's where he works, and if he took a car, it would be too likely to be shot during the battles in the city. So they definitely could be better. But yeah, they're alive. And the bar is low, but I'm thankful for that. Siegel: Having these conversations with your family and seeing what people you know have experienced back home, you mentioned earlier how odd it can be to live in a place where life is continuing to go on. And I think for a lot of people \u2014 I don't know what the right word is, it feels like people have become jaded to the war. It's been a year at this point. And I'm curious what you think people living in Massachusetts, or living somewhere else and listening right now, should know about your experience and the experience of people back home that's impossible for them to understand given where we are. Horokh: I agree. It's impossible to understand for people how it feels and how it goes. And I feel that it's a good thing that people do not understand that, because before it happens, you have a completely different idea of it. But I think the important point is to remember that the war is going on, or a battle is going on. And actually, every next day it's harder and harder. It's more cruel and more cruel. And Russian war crimes are more terrifying and more terrifying. So I think it's important that we do not get used to this, and to keep supporting Ukraine. As a director at my nonprofit, it's also very hard to fundraise for Ukraine lately. It gets harder and harder every next day because as people get used to war and move on with their lives, they are less and less willing to support. But the battle still goes, so we have to do everything that you could. Alston: Sasha, to that point, and to what Jeremy was saying earlier: We've been hearing about numerous polls that show that American public support for the aid that the U.S. is giving to Ukraine is waning, because they feel like there are other places where those resources could be allocated. What would you say to those people? Horokh: I feel it's very important to realize that supporting Ukraine is not charity. The way U.S. supports Ukraine, it supports all the values that U.S. stands for, which are democracy, freedom and a civilized world that Ukraine is standing for, not only for itself. Also, there was a Budapest Memorandum in 1994, if I'm not mistaken, where Ukraine gave up nuclear weapons. And several countries joined safety assurances for Ukraine to ensure that if anyone attacks, Ukraine is going to have all the resources it needs to defend itself. One of those countries was Russia, which is pretty ironic. But among other countries there also was the U.S. So I feel it's important for people to realize that supporting Ukraine is keeping up to the words they gave, and keeping the value of their promises high.",

Erskine said the side effects to these anti-psychotic medications are \"absolutely stunning\" and could include significant weight gain, problems standing or walking and involuntary movements.Lisa Cosgrove, professor of counseling and school psychology at UMass Boston, said there is a \"magic bullet mentality\" when it comes to psychotropics, which is why many providers automatically pivot to medication first. \"Unfortunately, this leads to what I would refer to as irrational polypharmacy, that is when one agent is added, another agent is added because you are focused on treating individual symptoms rather than looking at the patient holistically,\" she said.Watch: Over-prescribing mental health drugs can be dangerous, even deadly.

        "body": "Running a local newspaper for more than half a century is no small feat, but Melvin Miller isn\u2019t one to brag. \u201cThe question of legacy is always for other people to decide,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI\u2019m just a ditch digger. I just do the work.\u201d After nearly six decades, Miller says it\u2019s time for someone new to take over his life\u2019s work: the Bay State Banner, Boston\u2019s oldest Black-owned newspaper. Miller announced Wednesday he is handing the paper over to new owners as part of a larger expansion and redesign of the publication. The new owners, Ron Mitchell and Andre Stark, are veteran journalists with close ties to their Boston communities and long-standing family relationships with 88-year-old Miller, a Roxbury native. \u201cWe\u2019re journalists, we\u2019re filmmakers, but we\u2019re also people who have been telling the truth about our community,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take [The Banner] into the next half a century. We\u2019re going to transition it in many different ways to make it more amenable to a younger audience.\u201d Mitchell, 61, who previously worked at GBH News, resigned last week from a nearly 30-year career at WBZ-TV to prepare for his role as publisher and editor of the Banner, a return to his roots. Mitchell\u2019s family \u2014 including his aunt Jean McGuire, a former METCO director \u2014 had generations of ties to the Miller family. \u201cWe are living up to the responsibility that our families birthed us into,\u201d Mitchell said, \u201cto take responsibility for the communication in our community.\u201dStark, 63, who will serve as the paper\u2019s chief operating officer, is another GBH veteran who produced documentary films for PBS documentary series Frontline and NOVA. He serves as a board member at the Roxbury-based Center for Teen Empowerment, a nonprofit that provides resources to young people from local communities of color. Stark says he read the Banner as a child, the son of West-Indian parents who steeped him in Black cultural history and enrolled him in school at the Freedom House established by Otto and Muriel Snowden. His mother, a close friend of Miller\u2019s, brought Stark to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\u2019s march from his Roxbury neighborhood to the Boston Common in 1965. \u201cI think one of the reasons Mel felt comfortable transferring the mantle over to us is that he knows both of our families,\u201d Stark said. \u201cIt helps close the circle as he knows both of us from years ago.\u201d Kenneth Cooper, another GBH News veteran with decades of experience at newsrooms including the Washington Post, the Boston Globe and the St. Louis Dispatch, will join the Banner as an editorial consultant, overseeing a major expansion and transformation that lies ahead. Longtime Banner senior editor Yawu Miller has agreed to stay on (despite his uncle's departure) to manage the Boston edition of the paper. Financing for the transition came from private contributions from community members around Greater Boston and the Mill Cities Community Investment, a community development financial institution based in Lawrence. Both Miller and the new owners declined to disclose the financial terms of the deal. Within the next year, the Banner plans to distribute in other regional markets, including Connecticut, Rhode Island and Northern parts of Massachusetts, and positions will open for bureau chiefs in those areas, Mitchell said. The change of guard comes with plans for a new website and app, weekly 30-minute investigative news shows, wider coverage of sports and local business briefs. The expansion of online content will be overseen by Colin Redd, a 30-year-old Boston native who helps run Blavity, a Black-owned media company with an understanding of young audiences. The new website will include community services including access to loan applications, scholarships, a calendar of community events and other educational resources, Mitchell said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be an interactive resource, a portal of opportunities,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cThe website will be true community outreach, not just a physical rendition of the paper.\u201d The goal, Mitchell says, is to reach new audiences and expand coverage while preserving the publication\u2019s integrity as a source of local news for communities of color. \u201cThis is an extension of African-American culture going back hundreds of years, community storytelling that transformed into Black publishing,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cDating back to emancipation, Black papers told the truth about the Black community.\u201d The Banner has always stood out as a source of straightforward information, Mitchell says, representing an on-the-ground approach to issues directly impacting communities of color. \u201cThe Black community is not a monolith,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's why it is important to have a paper that understands the complexity of our community and tells us that's the only way you get the true story.\u201dMiller founded the Banner in 1965 to fill a void left by the folding of The Guardian, a newspaper led by civil rights leader William Monroe Trotter. His goal was never objectivity \u2014 an idea he dismisses as \u201cnonsense\u201d \u2014 but to be fair and honest, and to help readers understand \u201cthe complexity of American society\u201d with nuance and clarity. \u201cPeople would come up to me sometimes and ask me why we didn\u2019t cover some shooting, and I said, 'Hey, there are many places you can find that,'\u201d Miller said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to spend ten cents of my budget giving any attention to a brutal government. Not going to happen.\u201d Miller\u2019s hope for the paper is the continuation of his work highlighting the fabric of life in communities of color, emphasizing \u201cpositive, helpful and uplifting\u201d coverage whenever possible. \u201cIf we focus on the wrong things perpetually, then what we're doing is we are building that culture around those ideas, on the ugly angels,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI like to appeal to people\u2019s beautiful angels.\u201d",

        "body": "Updated at 2:30 p.m. March 2SeparatorUkrainian opera singer Olga Abakumova rehearsed on Monday in the cavernous auditorium of Belmont Town Hall, where she'll perform on Friday evening to raise money for her home country immersed in war.She was accompanied by Stephan Zaets, who plays the 68-string bandura, a Ukrainian folk instrument similar to a lute. She wore a traditional embroidered blouse called a sorochka. Abakumova came to the U.S. with her eight-year-old daughter in June as part of a special refugee program for Ukrainian citizens. They're now living in Sudbury, where she says the pine trees remind her of the place she grew up. Still, much of her family remains back in Ukraine.\"And I hope everything will be alright,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I hope this terrible war [is] stopped.\u201dLife before the Russian invasion used to be normal, Abakumova said.\"I had a lot of concerts, a lot of performances. I was enjoying life with my family,\u201d she said in Ukrainian, as interpreted by Iryna Piotrowska, a Ukrainian woman who lives in Belmont, and whose idea it was to put on Friday's fundraising concert. \u201cBut on the February 24th, everything changed.\"They left their home because Russian bombs were targeting cities, and they moved to a village where her in-laws lived. But they couldn't escape the war there, either.\"We were hearing the loud noises of missiles,\u201d she said through the interpreter. \u201cSo my daughter and I, we were spending time, days, in the bathroom. I was actually making her bed in the bathroom, and she was sleeping there because it was the safest place in the house.\"They applied for the U.S. refugee program, and Abakumova and her daughter came to America in June, leaving her husband behind. He plays the tuba in the Academic Symphony Orchestra of the Khmelnytsky Regional Philharmonic.\u201cAnd now he has many concerts in Europe supporting Ukraine and [the] Ukrainian army, military,\" Abakumova said in English.When she recalls the anguish of bidding her husband farewell, she switches to the Ukrainian language.\"I was crying. My husband was crying,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was heartbreaking because we just don't know when we will see each other again.\"One of the songs Abakumova will sing Friday is called \"Two Colors\" and is about a sorochka shirt like the one she was wearing. The song tells of a son leaving home, and his mother sewing him a red and black sorochka. \"Red symbolizes love and black symbolizes sadness,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's very apt for the situation, for the current situation now, because it's all tied together: love, and black for sadness, for the difficult situation that we're in.\"The idea to hold a fundraising concert came from Iryna Piotrowska, who grew up in Ukraine and now lives in Belmont, where she takes a Zumba dance fitness class in the large auditorium in the town hall where the concert will be held. Piotrowska\u2019s family in Ukraine includes a brother-in-law fighting on the front lines. \u201cAnd I would like to do something because I feel terrible inside,\u201d Piotrowska said. \u201cI feel so bad for my family, that they're living in this situation like this.\u201dThe concert will take place at Belmont Town Hall Friday at 6 p.m., and it will be live streamed on Belmont Media Center's YouTube page. It\u2019s a fundraiser for the Belmont-based nonprofit Refugee Protection International, which will use the money to support two hospitals in southern Ukraine damaged in January. \"They urgently need more surgical equipment, neonatal equipment, OB equipment, so mothers can give birth safely,\u201d said the organization\u2019s president Jennifer Hill. \u201cAnd that, we will bring in as soon as we get the money, we\u2019ll buy more and bring in across the border.\"As she looked ahead to Friday's concert, Abakumova switched back to English for a moment.\"For me, it's so important, like to take part in a performance supporting Ukraine, because it's...\"For a moment, she searched for the words in English before saying, in her mother tongue, that her performance Friday is a small contribution that she can make to help.SeparatorCorrection: This story was updated to correct the date when Olga said she left her home.",

        "body": "Gov. Maura Healey on Wednesday filed a $55.5 billion state budget that proposes a major boost for environmental and energy agencies, locks in tuition rates for Massachusetts students at state universities, and provides free phone calls for people in state prisons. \u201cToday, we wanted to present a budget that will set Massachusetts up for success by lowering costs, growing our economy and delivering on the promise of our people,\u201d Healey said. \u201cTogether, we\u2019re putting forth ambitious goals and historic, significant investments.\u201d Healey\u2019s budget for the 2024 fiscal year would increase spending by about 4% over this year\u2019s budget, and it creates a dedicated trust fund for revenue from the state\u2019s new tax on incomes over $1 million. Voters approved that tax at the ballot last November, and the money it generates is dedicated to education and transportation causes. Healey is planning to split $1 billion in millionaire\u2019s tax revenue roughly evenly between education and transportation, with a substantial chunk of it \u2014 $360 million \u2014 going towards higher education. \u201cOur public higher ed grads, they\u2019re our future teachers and nurses and business owners and accountants and entrepreneurs,\u201d said Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll, a Salem State University graduate. \u201cThe majority of folks graduating from our public higher ed institutions, they stay right here in the commonwealth.\u201d Healey is proposing to use $59 million of the millionaire\u2019s tax money for what she\u2019s calling \u201ctuition stabilization\u201d in the public higher education system \u2014 in-state undergraduates at the UMass campuses and state universities would pay the same tuition rates throughout their four years, rather than facing annual increases. UMass President Marty Meehan said the tuition certainty \"will help our students and their families plan for the cost of a UMass education while encouraging more students to finish their degree in four years, both of which will result in a more affordable degree.\"Other goals Healey has in mind for the surtax revenue include reducing waitlists for child care subsidies, expanding early college programs, creating a new grant to help fund municipal transportation projects, and stepping up investments in highway bridge preservation. Healey also wants to steer some of this money to regional transit authorities and to the MBTA, where it will help cover start-up costs for a means-tested fare program to make the T less expensive for people with lower incomes. Healey\u2019s budget also: Requires the Department of Correction to provide up to 1,000 minutes a month of free phone calls, estimated to cost $20 million. Lawmakers advanced no-cost calls legislation last year, but couldn\u2019t get former Gov. Charlie Baker on board.Increases funding for the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs by 24%, including money for 240 new staff members. The major funding hike prompted Sen. Mike Barrett, a Lexington Democrat who co-chairs the Telecommunications, Energy and Utilities Committee, to call Healey's plan \"the best executive branch budget I've ever seen\" and \"a leap over anything a governor has proposed before.\" Includes $324 million for the emergency assistance family shelter program, a 48% increase. The Healey administration says the program is expected to serve 338 new families a month in fiscal 2024. Delivers on a promise she made in her inaugural address by including $20 million to make community college free for eligible students age 25 and older. State financial aid already exists to defray the cost of community college, and Healey\u2019s office says the MassReconnect scholarships \u201cwould offer students last-dollar financial support to cover the cost of tuition, fees, books and supplies as well as provide funding for career and wraparound support services to encourage retention and degree completion.\u201d Alongside her budget, Healey also formally filed the $742 million tax-break package she announced Monday and a bill to add a dedicated housing secretary in her cabinet. Doug Howgate, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, said Healey\u2019s budget shows the state remains in a strong financial condition, giving the administration high marks for its tax relief plan, early education investments and what he called a \u201ctransparent approach to tracking and using surtax revenue.\u201d The Raise Up Massachusetts Coalition, which campaigned for the surtax, said Healey deserves credit for making sure that money is spent as intended on education and transportation. The coalition has knocked Healey's proposal to reform the estate tax and reduce the tax rate on short-term capital gains, assets held for a year or less. \"While the Governor\u2019s budget proposes several meaningful new initiatives, it doesn't come close to making the investments necessary to address our workforce challenges, tackle our broken childcare system, end the housing affordability crisis, or fix the MBTA and build a 21st century statewide transportation system,\" the coalition said in a statement.Healey\u2019s budget represents a starting point in a process that will stretch for months. The House, in mid-April, will rewrite her plan to reflect its own priorities and add in local earmarks for representatives\u2019 districts. The Senate will follow suit, debating and passing its own budget ahead of the Memorial Day holiday, and the two branches will iron out their differences in closed-door negotiations with the goal of agreeing on a final state budget by the Jul. 1 start of the new fiscal year.For the past several years, talks have dragged past that deadline, and the state has relied on temporary budgets to keep government running.

        "body": "Margaret R. Guzman, a former public defender, will be the first Hispanic judge to sit on the federal U.S. District Court for Massachusetts. The U.S. Senate voted 49-48 Thursday to confirm Guzman, a state court judge, to the seat. Vice President Kamala Harris broke the tie vote which split along party lines. Senator Mitt Romney, a Republican and former governor of Massachusetts, voted against the nomination. Guzman, who was nominated to the federal bench by President Biden last July, is a graduate of Clark University in Worcester, and the Boston University School of Law.She previously worked for the Committee for Public Counsel Services in Worcester from 1992 until 2005. Guzman went entered general law independent practice in 2005, working until her 2009 nomination to the Massachusetts Trial Court by then-Governor Deval Patrick. As an Associate Justice from 2009 to 2017, Guzman presided over criminal and civil matters in half of the state\u2019s District Courts. She has served as the first justice for the Ayer District Court since 2017.In floor remarks before the vote, Senator Ed Markey pointed to Guzman\u2019s varied legal experience.\u201cJudge Guzman will therefore bring to the federal bench not only the knowledge and experience of a state court judge who has presided over more than 1000 cases in her career that have gone to judgment, but the wisdom of a public defender and solo practitioner, joining together precisely the kind of professional legal diversity that the Biden administration has made a priority and that the federal judiciary badly needs,\u201d Markey said.Carl Tobias, Williams Chair in Law at the University of Richmond said Guzman\u2019s confirmation represents \u201ca perfect example\u201d of the Biden administration\u2019s effort to diversify the federal courts.\u201cThat is unusual and that\u2019s not a typical profile that you would\u2019ve seen historically,\u201d Tobias said when asked about Guzman\u2019s work history.Ultimately, Tobias added, experiential diversity \u2013 the types of legal practice a nominee has engaged in \u2013 add positively to a court\u2019s expertise.\u201cYou want a federal judiciary that reflect the people who come into court,\u201d he said. \u201cI think she, by virtue of her own experience, but also the people she\u2019s represented, will have a better sense than many judge would have of the types of people who will be in her federal court room.\u201d Other elected officials, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, praised Guzman\u2019s confirmation. \u201cJudge Guzman has an exceptional understanding of our entire justice system with roots in the Worcester legal community as a public defender and deep expertise as a Massachusetts trial court judge \u2013 and today, she is making history as the first Hispanic judge to serve on the District Court in Massachusetts,\u201d Warren said in a statement.Judge Guzman deferred requests for comment Wednesday to the White House.",

        "body": "When the light are off but sleep remains elusive, people are often tempted to look for answers where they always do: Online, and especially on YouTube.There, they can find content creators promising them easy ways to fall asleep fast, presented in attention-grabbing ways \u2014 but often with little to no scientific backing. Those videos often include misinformation and commercial biases, said Rebecca Robbins, a sleep researcher at Brigham and Women's Hospital and an author of a new study on sleep misinformation on YouTube. \u201cThese are videos that are developed by non-health professionals, often bloggers or maybe a health coach, but someone without specific sleep expertise,\u201d Robbins told GBH\u2019s Morning Edition co-hosts Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel. Sometimes the information has no scientific proof, but not directly harmful: That people should open and close their eyes a certain way, blink a certain number of times or find a pressure point on their foreheads. In one video Robbins reviewed, a creator talks about a \u201cmagic sleeping button\u201d and demonstrates her technique by pressing down on a point in the center of her cat\u2019s forehead. There\u2019s no evidence that those things work, Robbins said. \u201cThat is one claim that is certainly false. We don't have any evidence of such a sleep button,\u201d Robbins said. \u201cBut some of the more concerning claims had to do with beliefs that there are ways to get close to four hours of sleep, and some of the videos claim that their hacks would help you get there. And of course, that is false.\u201dRobbins and her colleagues reviewed the most-watched YouTube videos that came up when they searched for keywords like \u201cinsomnia\u201d and \u201csleep tips.\u201d They watched videos by popular creators, with an average of 8.2 million views per video, and compared them to videos made by doctors and sleep experts, which got an average of just 300,000 views per video. The more popular videos, often produced by people who create YouTube videos and other content professionally, often had misinformation, Robbins said. About two thirds of them also promoted a product or service. \u201cSome of these bloggers, they're really talented video creators. And so they use things like clickbait and kind of racy photos in some cases, and these claims that are controversial and lacking evidence base to kind of draw attention.\u201dThere\u2019s no one easy trick to help everyone fall asleep. But there are many evidence-based things to try. First: Don\u2019t skimp on sleep, Robbins said. \u201cThe optimal health and well-being for adults comes from sleep duration in the range of seven to nine hours, and we're all in a different place along that spectrum,\u201d she said. Try to go to bed around the same time, and wake up around the same time. Falling asleep is easier on a relatively consistent schedule, she said. \u201cIn a typical seven-day week, you want to vary by no more than one hour,\u201d she said. \u201cOur ability to fall asleep and wake up is in part governed by hormones that are associated with those processes. And those can't change on a dime.\"Try to think of falling asleep as a process, not the one magical moment of drifting off. \u201cIt would be wonderful to have such a sleep switch, as the YouTuber mentioned,\u201d Robbins said. \u201cThe truth is we kind of need to look at sleep as a process and setting ourselves up for success with relaxation techniques, unplugging from screens before bedtime to help us ease into sleep.\u201dOther things to try: Exercising during the day, though not right before bed and avoiding heavy meals right before bedtime. \u201cIf you're tossing and turning, maybe practicing some gentle meditation or gentle yoga poses could be a good way also to help you kind of overcome some of those insomnia like symptoms,\u201d she said. \u201cThe good news is small changes go a long way when it comes to our sleep.\u201dNone of the techniques are perfect, Robbins said. Life gets in the way, and insomnia will sometimes come despite best efforts.\u201cSleep isn't going to be perfect every night,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we seek perfection and then we get frustrated when we experience difficulties. But the truth is: sleep is fundamentally a consequence of our daily lives.\u201d",

        "body": "February is a time when we honor the achievements of Black people past and present, and celebrate all different types of love. But this February was particularly marked by tragedy. There was the earthquake that devastated Turkey and Syria, a number of deadly shootings and the one-year anniversary of the war in Ukraine. Locally, Boston has been mourning two horrific acts of violence against Black people: the murder of 13-year-old Tyler Lawrence of Norwood in Mattapan, and the police beating death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis. Through all the tragedy within Black communities and beyond, there is resilience \u2014 resilience that comes from love. To capture that, we reached out to a few people to share their love stories.LaTrelle and Tyrone Chase met in high school, but as with many couples, they debate the details of the first encounter.\u201cIt was ninth grade, what was it, lunch?\u201d Tyrone said.\u201cYeah, you were talking about my jacket,\u201d LaTrelle said, laughing. \u201cShe had a Members Only jacket,\u201d he said.\u201cIt was not a Members Only jacket,\u201d she said.The two have been married for almost 27 years, and are still just as playful with each other today.In their time together, Latrelle and Tyrone Chase have shared joy and pain, including coming to terms with not being able to have children. LaTrelle Chase had her first miscarriage less than a year after their wedding, and her second a little over a year later. The following year, she miscarried again. \u201cMiscarriage and child loss is an extremely prevalent thing in the Black community,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was extremely difficult. It was embarrassing. And it definitely tested our relationship.\u201d\u201cYou always want to hear the happy ending, and this is not necessarily a happy ending,\u201d Tyrone Chase said. \u201cBut we can live through it, and it not destroy us.\u201dIn fact, the Chases say it made their relationship stronger. It\u2019s that will to keep going that has always carried Black people through tough times, even when they shouldn\u2019t have had to.Rod Collins is the nephew of civil rights icon Malcolm X, who came to Boston as a teenager in the 1940s to live with his sister and Rod\u2019s mother, Ella Little-Collins, in what is now the Malcolm X-Ella Little-Collins house in Roxbury. His family\u2019s history led him to India in 1986. There, he met his wife, Annie, while she was working at a hotel. \u201cI [see] this stunning, beautiful young lady when I go to the counter and get my keys, and I caught her eyes \u2014 the eyes that went into your soul,\u201d Rod Collins said. \u201cHer pleasantry, her spirit, everything about her. I tried to dismiss it a little bit, but then she finally got to me.\u201d\u201cThe first questions that Rod asked me were \u2018Can I have my keys?\u2019 and \u2018Are you married?\u2019\u201d Annie Collins said. \u201cAnd I said \u2018Yes, you can have your keys, and no, I\u2019m not married.\u2019\u201dAs their relationship blossomed, Annie\u2019s family warned things would be difficult for her in the U.S.\u201cMy dad knew it wouldn\u2019t be easy,\u201d Annie Collins said. \u201cWe never traveled or anything, but my dad understood the challenges that I would have being married to a Black person in America.\u201dIndeed, long before hashtags and viral videos, the world knew Black people were treated differently here. But for more than 35 years, Annie has chosen to love Rod despite those challenges. She said they have endured instances of injustice, including violence inflicted on their children, Arjun and Dayorsha, by Boston police in the early 2000s. \u201cSupposedly, the cops said somebody called and said this tall Middle Eastern-looking girl has a gun in her bag,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so they came in and of course, and they went to Dayorsha. Arjun, of course, reacted. And this cop, he put a gun in Arjun's back. Because he was reacting to his sister being attacked. And so, you know, it's just things like that. It always reminds me of what my dad said.\u201dAnnie said they did not file a report about the incident. Rod said as some of the most loving and giving people on the Earth, Black people should be judicious about who they give their love to. It\u2019s a sentiment echoed by his uncle in this undated speech: \u201cWe are peaceful people, we are loving people,\u201d Malcolm X said. \u201cWe love everybody who loves us. But we don\u2019t love anybody who doesn\u2019t love us. We\u2019re nonviolent with people who are nonviolent with us. But we are not nonviolent with anyone who is violent with us.\u201dHistorically, Malcolm X's tactics have been juxtaposed against the righteous love and peaceful nonviolence characterized by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. But taking a closer look, you can see love along the entire spectrum of the struggle, even if it has to be unearthed. And when that love doesn't come from others, it's important to find it within oneself.\"Self-love, for me, is educating myself about being Black,\" said 15-year-old Ketura Joseph, a ninth grader at Brooke Charter High School in Boston.With that education, her understanding of Black history and resilience has changed, she said.\"I always saw slavery as such a terrible thing, and I guess that changed this year for me in high school since they put more emphasis on people being brave, overcoming challenges,\" Joseph said. \"And if you really know how to love yourself, then you can really be proud to be Black.\"So here's to love and here's to Blackness, both being celebrated and persevering all month and all year long.",

        "body": "Updated at 1:24 p.m.SeparatorBoston Police Commissioner Michael Cox responded Monday night to accusations of political discrimination from a pair of recently fired officers, saying the two individuals were dismissed for different reasons after internal investigations. Two former members of the Boston Police Department, Sgt. Shana Cottone and Officer Joe Abasciano, said they were terminated from employment Monday. Both have amassed media attention from actions related to their political views over the last two years. In a statement via Boston First Responders United, the anti-vaccine mandate group for public safety employees, Cottone and Abasciano charged that their firings were \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d and retaliation \u201cfor speaking out in support of personal choice and freedom of speech.\u201dCottone was one of the officers leading the charge against Mayor Michelle Wu\u2019s vaccine mandate as the city began emerging from strict quarantine measures last year. She repeatedly protested in front of the mayor\u2019s Roslindale home, which prompted the Boston City Council to scale back the lawful hours of targeted picketing.Abasciano took part in the anti-vaccine mandate protests and was also one of two officers investigated for tweets and alleged involvement in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol in 2021. In a statement to GBH News Monday night, Cox said the firings were decided in separate cases based on their conduct.\u201cWhile in the Department\u2019s employ, Abasciano authored a series of social media posts that called into question his ability to provide police services in an unbiased and objective manner,\u201d the commissioner said. \u201cAbasciano\u2019 s conduct impairs the operation of this Department and its employees by diminishing the Departments\u2019 reputation and trust within the community. Due to this Mr. Abasciano is no longer a Boston Police officer.\"The commissioner did not say which of Abasciano\u2019s specific social media posts violated the department\u2019s rules of conduct or canon of ethics, but an internal affairs document obtained by GBH News shows his confirmed Twitter account tweeting messages that could be interpreted as threatening toward then-U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and other officials.Tweet posted at 6:44 a.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021: \u201cMAGA Millions Patriots here in DC. Today is a day for choosing. Today there will only two parties in America. Traitors and Patriots!\u201d Tweet posted at 8:14 a.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021: \u201cHey @senatemajldr look out your window. Millions of Patriots are on your doorstep and we are watching. It is a time for choosing. Are yiu a traitor or are you a patriot.\u201d @senatemajldr is the former Twitter handle of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Tweet posted at 12:40 p.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021: \u201cEverything that happens going forward @ VP is now on your conscience.\u201d Tweet posted at 3:54 p.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021: \u201cI hope you never sleep well again @VP your Treasonous Act lead to the murder of an innocent girl and the death of America. You are not a Godley man. I guess @LLinWood was right about you all along.\u201d @LLinWood was an account that previously made direct statements about plans to harm the Vice President. Abasciano claimed the tweet was not posted in reference to those threats. Tweet posted at 5:22 p.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021: \u201cWhat I saw in today frankly made me weep for our once-great nation. The Political Elitist Class has successfully turned Americans against each other. Patriots v Law Enforcement trying to do their jobs in a no-win position. I fear this Treasonous election has killed the republic.\u201d The investigator who examined Abasciano\u2019s case \u2014 which initially involved a charge of neglect of duty/unreasonable judgment \u2014 ultimately recommended a finding of \u201cnot sustained.\u201dReached by phone Monday, Abasciano said his termination was \u201cclearly\u201d retaliatory and punitive.\u201cIt\u2019s my First Amendment right to express my feelings and sentiments,\u201d he said. \u201cThe mayor is pushing for an overarching, anti-First Amendment policy for all city employees where they\u2019re not allowed to speak out against the City Council, [or] her [the mayor's] city policy.\u201dAbasciano added that, at one point, his case was closed, then re-opened for further investigation before he was ultimately fired. GBH News has repeatedly asked the mayor about Abasciano\u2019s case during her monthly appearances on the midday Boston Public Radio program. In her latest appearance Tuesday afternoon, Wu backed the commissioner\u2019s decision to fire Cottone and Abasciano.\u201cI support Commissioner Cox's decision to move forward with termination for these officers. Each has a separate set of actions that was detailed [and] investigated,\u201d Wu said, adding that a third officer, Michael Geary, was also recently terminated.Geary, Wu said, responded to an FBI call for help identifying Jan. 6 rioters with a message that said \u201crats get bats.\u201d\u201cPolice officers perform some of the most important work in our society,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cThey swear an oath to uphold the laws of our country, our state and our city, as well as the rules of the Boston Police Department, that is how we implement public safety is by ensuring the public trust that the laws will be upheld and that rules will be followed fairly. That means at a very baseline, our officers have to follow the rules.\u201dRegarding Cottone, Cox said she had \u201cmultiple violations\u201d of several department rules and procedures.\u201cThere were six separate internal affairs investigations,\u201d Cox said, pointing to a neglect of duty charge, a respectful treatment charge, a statement of opinions charge and a conformance to laws charge.\u201cCottone\u2019s conduct in these cases reflects a pattern and inability to adhere to the rules and procedures of this Department. These violations along with Cottone\u2019s disciplinary history render her unsuitable to continue her employment with the Boston Police Department and thus her employment has been terminated.\"Said Cottone: \u201cThe type of protest I engaged in was peaceful protest. That\u2019s the type of protest that our country was founded on. Standing outside of the mayor\u2019s house chanting 'Shame on Wu' is not really the most sensational type of protest.\u201dBoth officers have obtained attorneys and pledged to appeal their firings. This story was updated to include Mayor Michelle Wu's comments on Boston Public Radio.",

        "body": "In the small town of Denmark, near the New Hampshire border, some residents are calling for more accountability from bottled water giant Poland Spring. The company extracts water from land it owns in Denmark and then sells it to consumers. The town isn't compensated for what is withdrawn. And climate change is fueling concerns about protecting the local water supply.Last November, on the north end of Long Pond, Jim Metivier stood on his backyard dock and explained how water levels on his property have gradually receded. At first, he said the dock needed two platforms to access the pond from the shore.\"And then, probably about seven years ago, I had \u2014 one, two, three, four five,\" he said pointing to dock several dock extensions. \"Plus, there's a floating one at the end that's all still in the mud.\"Metivier's family has had a home here for 30 years. As ponds go, this one is small, about four miles long and 19 feet deep. In the spring, he said the water is high enough to launch his canoe from the dock. But for the past two summers and into the fall, the dock has literally been stuck in the mud.\"I haven't been able to get my canoe out since July,\" Metivier said.While Poland Spring does not withdraw water from the pond, a state permit for \"large-scale pumping or extraction of groundwater, spring water and water from aquifers\" was first approved in Denmark in 2005. That year, and again in 2008, several pumping tests were conducted as surface and groundwater levels in the vicinity were monitored.The results were reviewed by a hydrogeologist at the Department of Environmental Protection. Department staff also visited the site. Ultimately, they determined that the proposed pumping operation would not \"have an undue unreasonable effect on waters of the State\" or violate any state water quality law.Records show there has been less precipitation since 2005, but those same pumping tests have been referenced each time Poland Spring's permit has been renewed.The company is allowed to withdraw up to 432,000 gallons of water per day and no more than 105.1 million gallons in any 365-day period. That's a fraction of the water that's available, according to estimates from a Portland engineering firm that helped with the application.In return for the extraction, Poland Spring pays about $34,000 in annual property taxes and has donated money to several local causes, including the Denmark Fire Department, a local culvert project and installation of lights on the town ballfield. Critics say it's hardly an equitable exchange.\"When the property was purchased, I think the conception was that having Poland Springs as a neighbor was going to be a good thing,\" said Michael Fitzgibbons, who owns a vacation home with his partner on Long Pond.Poland Spring pumps water from two bore holes on its land near the pond. One is less than half a mile from Fitzgibbons' house. The water is then piped to a loading dock and trucked to bottling plants about 30 miles away. Last summer, Fitzgibbons said his backyard was more suited to a golf course than it was for launching a boat.\"My water receded 15 feet,\" he said. \"We've seen several years of drought now. That's why it's absolutely critical that we pay attention to what we have. And if we're going to basically give that prized commodity away, we better do it knowingly and it should be controlled by the state.\"\"We're not causing it to be low. It's naturally low,\" said Mark Dubois, the natural resource manager for Poland Spring, whose parent company, Connecticut-based Blue Triton Brands, was formerly known as Nestle Waters North America.\"When it rains, the pond will fill up. When it doesn't rain, the pond does get low,\" Dubois said. \"But it's not involved with our operation.\"Asked whether the pond is spring fed, Dubois answered, \"Not to my knowledge.\"But a 1952 study by the U.S. Geological Survey describes Long Pond as a \"small, spring-fed trout pond.\" John Mullaney, a hydrologist with the USGS New England Water Science Center, said that's the same as being \"groundwater fed,\" which means it likely does have some connection to the aquifer.And, while he hasn't studied the pond, Mullaney said if that's the case, pumping operations could affect water levels, along with drought and other factors.\"Changes can be rather subtle from pumping,\" he said. \"When groundwater is extracted, there's ultimately going to be less water coming out somewhere. And that's the question is always where and to what degree is that allowable?\"Over the next year, Mullaney will be taking a closer look at Denmark's water supply as part of a national study on bottled water extraction in several parts of the country. The headwaters of the upper Saco River is one of the areas being reviewed. The study will include modeling for climate change factors such warmer temperatures and less snowfall.Last summer, during a widespread drought, Poland Spring proposed to double its water withdrawals from one of its bore holes in Hollis. The proposal received DEP approval. But local residents, including some whose wells had run dry, turned out in force at two public meetings to object. The company later pulled its application, telling the Maine Monitor, \"Consistent with our principle and longstanding practice of being a good neighbor, we have determined it is in the best interest of everyone not to proceed at this time.\"Meanwhile, in the town of Denmark, Dubois said Poland Spring tries to be responsive to drier conditions, cutting back pumping operations when necessary. Monthly water summaries, however, show that more water was extracted in July and especially August than in the month of April during spring runoff.As part of the company's permit, surface water, springs and more than two dozen wells, including domestic ones, are regularly monitored. The data are reviewed by outside experts, including the Maine DEP and by a geologist hired by the town of Denmark. They are also shared on the town's website.\"We can ensure that we have no adverse impact on area water supplies. But also, we can see that things are pretty stable here in Denmark,\" Dubois said.Some residents are skeptical. Given what's happening out West, they say there should be more regulation of the water resource. They also question the independence of the town geologist, whose costs are reimbursed by Poland Spring and whose predecessor was recently hired by an engineering firm that works closely with the company.\"It's hard for us not to feel sometimes like there is a conflict of interest,\" said Laurie LaMountain, who serves on the town planning board and on a committee that is currently reviewing the town's water extraction ordinance.During an October workshop on the aquifer, LaMountain asked the town's current geologist, Brian Bachmann of the St. Germain environmental consulting firm, about his allegiance to the town of Denmark.\"Our obligation is based on our code of ethics,\" Bachmann said. \"We're obligated to represent the best interest of our client.\"\"And the client being?\" LaMountain asked.\"In this instance it would be the town,\" Bachmann said.But over the past few months, Bachmann has been absent from meetings to discuss strengthening the town's water extraction ordinance, which is now more than a decade old. Meanwhile, Dubois and other representatives for Poland Spring are regular, active participants.Denmark Town Manager Betty LeGoff said in an email that only a small amount of money was budgeted for the committee's work. So, she said it was determined that Bachmann should not attend. She also declined to allow him to be interviewed for this story, calling it an \"unnecessary expense\" for a contractor for the town.Not far from Long Pond, Chris Doyle of Denmark has a small, energy efficient house and a shallow well that was dug two years ago. It's just outside what's known as the \"zone of influence\" \u2014 the area of groundwater affected by pumping. There's just one problem. Doyle said at certain times of the year it runs dry.\"This (past) spring it was full. And then we realized it wasn't coming back after about a week or so. So, we stopped using it completely,\" she said.Doyle can tell how much Poland Spring is pumping by looking at the town's website. She's convinced that her water level drops when extraction rates increase. But the company stands by its monitoring of other wells that shows groundwater levels are adequate. Bachmann said at his workshop that it would be helpful to have even more data to understand what's going on in the aquifer.\"Just more information around the pond to help you guys make your decisions here is really kind of the ultimate goal,\" he said.The town's ordinance includes action and alert levels. If water drops to a certain point in Poland Spring's monitoring wells, pumping can be reduced or halted. But LaMountain said that hasn't happened in more than a decade, not since the town select board agreed to relax the threshold at the company's request.That's why she and others are hopeful that the Water Ordinance Review Committee can strengthen protections in the coming months.\"We're living in a changing climate, LaMountain said. \"And it's just a lot of water to be taking from this aquifer.\"A final decision on the ordinance will be left to the town select board. Dubois said he hopes what emerges will be based on science. Denmark residents, meanwhile, say they're just looking for some additional control.SeparatorThis story was originally published on Maine Public.

        "body": "The seizure of Silicon Valley Bank is having large ripple effects across Massachusetts, in markets as diverse as tech, finance and even affordable housing. Silicon Valley Bank imploded on Friday when federal regulators announced their takeover of the institution. The second-largest bank failure in U.S. history was triggered by its disclosure last week that SVB had growing losses on government bonds because of rising interest rates. That\u2019s when many clients began withdrawing their funds, causing it all to capsize. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, said customers will have access to their funds on Monday. Silicon Valley Bank did not return requests for comment. \u201cIt\u2019s a seismic event in our financial system and our banking system,\u201d said Cornelius Hurley, a banking law professor at Boston University. On Sunday, New York state regulators also announced they were shuttering the New York-based Signature Bank, with the FDIC taking control of the company, too. Some startups can lean into the bailout from the federal government, but relief might be more complicated for the housing industry. The big reason for this is Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s $900 million acquisition of Boston Private Bank, a trust and banking provider that long had a major presence in the region. SVB\u2019s website says that is has loaned and invested more than $2 billion in affordable housing projects nationwide since 2002. Beyond immediate concerns of payroll, some worry that it will make funding more difficult for current projects in the region. \u201cIt was a very strong community lender involved in a lot of affordable housing deals,\u201d said Marc Draisen, head of the Metropolitan Area Planning Council. He estimates the number of nonprofit developers in the area that relied on SVB for loans to be in the \u201cdouble digits.\u201d He said that with real estate deals, developers generally have to deposit their money in the bank as well, not just take the loans. \u201cA lot of affordable housing lenders have deposits,\u201d Draisen said. \u201dIn some cases, it can also include construction loans \u2014 which, of course, could be one of the most serious parts of this situation, because those developers may have to go out and get another construction loan if the cash will no longer be forthcoming from Silicon Valley Bank.\u201d Developers could hit a barrier when they find much higher interest rates at those other banks, and lose funds.More immediately, there are concerns about how to pay contractors.Draisen said this is all a reminder of why diversifying financing is important. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder that we need lots of banks to be involved in financing affordable housing, not just a small handful,\u201d he said.In Boston, Mayor Michelle Wu\u2019s administration created a survey to gauge impact from area entrepreneurs and businesses. \u201cThis is a deeply distressing moment for many business leaders, entrepreneurs, nonprofits, and workers in our community, and they will not be left to fend for themselves,\u201d the mayor said in a statement. \u201cIn partnership with the Commonwealth, our immediate focus is helping our businesses make payroll and provide for their employees. We appreciate the local banks stepping up quickly to serve these companies and support their workers.\u201dWu said in a press gaggle that so far a \u201csmall number\u201d of affordable housing developments considered SVB for construction loans, with seven identified so far. The mayor said she doesn\u2019t believe those who got mortgage products from SVB will have any risk of their funding being jeopardized, but \u201cwe are working to get in touch with everyone individually and make sure we can be a support as well.\u201dThe FDIC said that customers who had up to $250,000 per account deposited with SVB would have access to their funds, but people with an excess of that have to call individually. Many developers borrow over $250,000. The impacts on existing affordable housing projects could be wide ranging. While the FDIC only commented on deposits, Silicon Valley Bank was involved in a multitude of obligations beyond that, to developers. \u201cThere's projects at different points in the process, right? So one would expect it would be different in each one of those points in the process. But the point is, it's much more than just deposits that the bank was involved in,\u201d said Kevin Murray, interim executive director of the Massachusetts Association of Community Development Corporations. He said the organization had a meeting this morning to discuss the impacts with local community development corporations. \u201cOne woman who came to the meeting today was very concerned because they just last week finished the first-time homebuyer course and SVB was one of the main participants on the banking side,\u201d Murray recalled. \u201cSo what happens to all those people who've been through this whole process? What does it mean to become a first-time homebuyer and suddenly the main partner in this process is gone?\u201dA number of nonprofits are being impacted by the SVB\u2019s collapse as well, according to Jim Klocke, CEO of the Massachusetts Nonprofit Network, for the same reason: being holdover clients of Boston Private Bank. Some of the uncertainty was rectified when the federal government announced they were going to make depositors at SVB whole, said Klocke. But the whole situation is putting donors on edge. \u201cFrankly, the news that the bank was in trouble, the news that the bank was being closed then in and of itself creates tremendous uncertainty among employees who wonder about their next paycheck, among vendors who wonder about their next payments, and among nonprofits who have been planning to receive donations from people who might now be more reluctant to make donations because their bank just went under,\u201d he said. For venture capital fund firms, it was about finding fast solutions to an unpredictable situation. Adrian Mendoza, general partner of Mendoza Ventures, a Boston-based venture capital fund, said he was up past midnight helping clients who have accounts with SVB.\u201cOver the weekend we saw both funds and businesses unable to run payroll at all,\u201d he said. \u201cWe reached out to our entrepreneurs. We had minimal exposure, anyone who had just a little bit \u2014 we reached out to our other banking partners and they quickly spun up, over the weekend, bank accounts.\u201dHurley, the Boston University professor, questions whether the federal government is raising the deposit insurance ceiling \u201cto the sky\u201d and said that hasn\u2019t been answered yet. He anticipates that there will be broader repercussions to taxpayers. \u201cWhen banks have to pay higher premiums to the FDIC, they\u2019re going to take that out on somebody. They\u2019re going to take it out on their customers, either in the form of higher fees or lower deposit rates or higher credit rates on loans. So there\u2019s a tremendous impact on the taxpayers,\u201d he said. Gov. Maura Healey sent a statement to reporters on Sunday, saying that her office is \u201cclosely monitoring\u201d the situation, and has been in contract with federal regulators about impact. \u201cOur administration is actively working to support individuals and businesses affected by SVB\u2019s closure and to find solutions to help them address immediate needs, including putting supports in place to ensure that small businesses and employees do not experience significant disruptions,\u201d Healey wrote. Wu\u2019s office said Boston\u2019s Economic Opportunity & Inclusion Cabinet will be hosting several informational sessions over the next two weeks to educate residents and businesses on what\u2019s happened, what they can do to support those impacted.

        "body": "Every week, GBH News assignment editor Matt Baskin joins GBH\u2019s All Things Considered to look at stories the newsroom is following. This week, reporters will be covering the impact of a seemingly late nor'easter, the local reverberations of bank collapses, and a federal court challenge to Boston's recently redrawn voting district maps. What follows is a lightly edited transcript of the conversation between Baskin and host Arun Rath.Arun Rath: So the start of spring is only a week away, with winter coming to an end \u2014 well, we already know that winter is not necessarily coming to an end with spring in Massachusetts. But we're supposedly getting the first big snow event tomorrow, blasting a big, long time. How are we handling this big, impending massive snowstorm that we're told is happening? Matt Baskin: Well, as I think, you know, I'm a little bit allergic to making a big, big deal out of winter weather. This is New England; we can cope. And how many times have we had a nor'easter in the forecast that turns out to be a dud? That said, as you note, it's late in the season to be getting what seems like it could be our first serious snow of the year, at least in Eastern Mass. Supposedly, what this is going to look like is a lot of rain overnight with snow starting mid- to late-morning west of the city and in the early afternoon closer to the coast. We seem to be looking at about 8 inches around Greater Boston, up to a foot-and-a-half for points north and west. And again, in terms of timing, you're right, it's not at all unprecedented for us to get big snowstorms in March or even April. Back in 1997, we actually had a huge blizzard on April Fool's Day. I was in elementary school and I remember getting a surprise snow day.As far as what our coverage is going to look like, I don't think it's a good use of our reporters' time to go roaming through grocery stores to see how much milk and bread is still on the shelves. What we do will be about impact: what does this mean for schools; what does this mean for roads; and, of course, what does this mean for the T? You know, it's funny, it was eight years ago \u2014 2015 \u2014 when the state's new governor, Charlie Baker, was just settling into office when Massachusetts got slammed with back-to-back-to-back snowstorms that crippled the T. Eight years later, Maura Healey is the new governor who's been on the job just a couple of months, the T is in absolute shambles, and here comes the snow. So this could be an interesting stress test for a transit system that's been stumbling and then some.Rath: And speaking of stress tests, the banking world is dealing with a big one right now. We saw the collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Silicon Valley Bank in particular is known for funding startups, which might have been part of its problem. But that means that's reverberating locally, right?Baskin: It sure is. There are all sorts of startups and tech companies in Massachusetts that did their banking through SVB, and this has made for several very stressful days for them. They've been worried about everything from the basic responsibility of paying their workers on time to the very future of their businesses. It's important to say that this goes beyond just corporate players, too. Our journalists have heard that there are folks in and around Boston who had mortgages through SVB, we understand that SVB was a lender for some affordable housing projects that are in progress [and] some nonprofits may have apparently been impacted. Our colleague Sarah Betancourt has been reporting on this today. You'll probably be hearing her in your newscast coming up. And we'll have a story from her online at GBHNews.org, looking at how the tentacles of this screwup are extending far beyond Silicon Valley and affecting people here in Massachusetts. Rath: Finally, Matt, it's been a little while since we've heard about Boston's plan to remap its voting districts. Things got pretty heated in the City Council as it was being debated. And this is headed to court now?Baskin: That's right. Let me start with some background. In November, the City Council voted on and Mayor [Michelle] Wu signed a plan to redraw voting lines in the city. One of the goals was to give voters of color a better shot at exercising their power and improving the representation. But while this was under debate, City Councilor Frank Baker complained that the new districts would dilute the voting power of white Catholics in parts of Southie and Dorchester, his district, District 3. And he actually went so far as to suggest that this was some sort of inside job motivated by sectarianism, because the key city councilor behind the new map, Liz Breadon, is a Protestant originally from Northern Ireland. Baker was roundly and immediately condemned. He apologized. The new map passed 9-4 and mayor who signed it. So that was all four months ago. Now, folks who oppose the new map who lost out in the City Council are hoping they can win in a new venue, namely federal court. The plaintiffs, led by Robert O'Shea, who's the chair of the Democratic Committee in Ward 6 in Southie, argued that the map approved by the City Council and Mayor Wu is in violation of everything from Boston City Charter up to and including the United States Constitution. Their complaint raises concerns about splitting up votes in some big public housing projects between districts, and it claims that, as drawn, the map would disempower white voters. A couple city councilors are prepared to testify against the map process behind it. Not Frank Baker, but his colleagues Michael Flaherty and Ed Flynn. Flaherty is an at-large councilor representing the whole city. Flynn, son of former Mayor Ray Flynn, represents District 2, which includes parts of Southie and stands to shed some voters under the map in question, they'd be shifted into District 3. And Congressman Stephen Lynch is also on deck to testify. His congressional district includes parts of Boston we're talking about. And he, too, opposes this map. There's a hearing in federal court scheduled for tomorrow and we'll be covering it.Rath: Super interesting. I'm glad we're going to be on top of this map. Thank you.Baskin: You got it.",

        "body": "A handful of incumbent politicians are seeking to testify in the federal court case challenging the legality of Boston\u2019s voter district maps, including U.S. Rep. Stephen Lynch, who has served in Congress since 2001.Rep. Lynch represents Massachusett\u2019s 8th District, which includes part of Boston. Court documents filed last week show Lynch as scheduled to offer in-person testimony when arguments to bar the City of Boston from enacting its redistricting maps are heard Tuesday. A second hearing date in the case is scheduled for later this month. Others intending to testify this month include Boston City Council President Ed Flynn, At-Large Councilor Michael Flaherty, State Senator Nick Collins and former City Councilor and recently retired City Clerk Maureen Feeney.The lawsuit lays bare a rift among Boston Democrats who have drifted into two camps in recent years \u2014 in one lies an increasingly progressive crop of new politicians, in the other, the centrists of the old guard.The rift, which plays out frequently among the historically diverse Boston City Council, has tended to fall along racial lines, with councilors of color typically aligning in the progressive bloc, and white councilors, particularly those with ties to the neighborhoods that represent traditional centers of white power and influence, filing into the centrist bloc.Race and power emerged as a flashpoint during the redistricting process as the council attempted to address an explosion of growth in the South Boston Seaport neighborhood and a simultaneous loss of Black residents across the city over the last decade.Between September 2021 and November 2022, councilors involved in the map-making process attempted to remedy the issues by shaving off a portion of the overgrown South Boston district and adding it to a neighboring Dorchester district, triggering a shift in the bottom portion of the latter\u2019s boundary lines.Many white politicians from those two districts resisted the shift.In one community meeting, former Clerk Feeney, who represented the Dorchester district implored council members not to shift the area\u2019s boundaries. \u201cDon\u2019t take power from one neighborhood to give it to another neighborhood,\u201d she said.In an affidavit, At-Large Councilor Erin Murphy claimed that the approved map \u201cis based on race in violation of the Voting Rights Act\u201d and was designed \u201cto diminish the voting power of white voters in City Council District 3 whose rights are sacred under the VRA and the 14th Amendment.\u201dCouncil President Flynn, who currently represents the South Boston district, also called for a halt to the map\u2019s approval a day before it was scheduled to go to the floor for a vote in November.The council map-making process ended on a sour note the following day when Dorchester Councilor Frank Baker accused his Irish-born Protestant colleague, Liz Breadon of Allston-Brighton, of deliberately attempting to disempower Irish Catholics in the city with the map.The current redistricting legal case was initially brought by a coalition of predominantly white, South Boston-based political power players, including former State Rep. and former Hingham Selectman Paul Gannon, an attorney in the now-federal legal challenge.Gannon and Robert O\u2019Shea of South Boston\u2019s Democratic Ward Committee unsuccessfully attempted to block the council from approving the map with a request for a temporary restraining order in state court. In it, they alleged council members violated open meeting law on three separate occasions by meeting with a quorum, or simple majority, of redistricting committee members without giving advance notice. According to state law, if a quorum of a public body wants to discuss public business within that body\u2019s jurisdiction, they must do so during a properly posted meeting.Superior Court Judge Anthony M. Campo denied the immediate bid to block the vote.Later, the focus of the case shifted when the South Boston coalition amended their court complaint by adding several constituents of color to their cadre and alleging violations of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the 14th Amendment.Lawyers for the City of Boston eventually moved the case to federal court.Lynch was not immediately available for comment regarding his role in the lawsuit, but the congressman has previously written in opposition to the redistricting map. In a November letter to the state court judge, he claimed the new map \u201carbitrarily and recklessly\u201d divided the communities in a pair of South Boston housing projects that fall within his Congressional district.\u201cThese public housing communities are classic communities of interest in the legal sense as they predominately consist of non-English speaking, low-income families of color who are kindred in socioeconomic status, education, employment and their common identity as recently arrived immigrants,\u201d Lynch wrote. Furthermore, he argued that the new map could \u201cweaken the voting strength\u201d of these like-minded voters in Boston\u2019s future elections.Judge Patti B. Saris, a Clinton-era nominee, is now presiding over the case.A coalition of advocacy groups devoted to serving marginalized populations, including the Boston Branch of the NAACP, Massachusetts Voter Table and the Chinese Progressive Association, are planning to show up to Tuesday\u2019s hearing as a show of support for Boston\u2019s latest redrawn map. The groups filed a shared legal brief in support of the city\u2019s map. The federal case adds another layer of tension to Boston\u2019s struggle with race and voting power within the storied and changing city.",

        "body": "An intense storm is going to affect Southern New England beginning overnight and continuing through Tuesday night. This storm will bring strong coastal wind, which will penetrate to a lesser extent inland, and heavy torrential rain with an eventual change to heavy snow. The timing of that change from rain to snow will drastically affect how much snow accumulates.The winds will arrive Monday evening and strengthen overnight. By Tuesday morning, the wind will be gusting along the coastline. At times during Tuesday, it could be as high as 50 to 60 miles an hour right along the water's edge. These strong winds may produce some power outages. Those winds will subside toward Wednesday morning has that part of the storm dissipates.Precipitation will come down very hard Tuesday morning and afternoon. For most of us it'll be in the form of rain to start, but changing over to snow from Northern Worcester County and then headed toward Boston for the early afternoon. The exact time of the changeover from rain to snow will be critical to how much snow you receive. There will be bands of heavy rain and snow rotating around the system during the afternoon. If the changeover occurs as these bands come through, you could expect one to two inches of snow in an hour. However if the change is delayed in your area, that precipitation will simply fall as heavy rain.This is why the gradient between a little snow and a lot of snow is so tight. This is the most difficult part of the storm: A difference in one or two degrees can mean a couple of inches of snow or over half a foot. The computer guidance we all use to help us forecast is good, but it has a hard time with such volatile and marginal situations.I think the heaviest bands of snow will be over between 6 and 8 p.m., but there can be lingering snow showers, some of which could be briefly heavy right through the early morning hours. Travel is not recommended Tuesday afternoon once the change occurs. You will not want to be caught on the roads as conditions will rapidly change, and visibility in some areas could be near zero for a while. It wouldn't surprise me if we even heard the rumble of thunder.Tides are astronomically low right now, so I'm not terribly concerned about coastal flooding. The wind and wave action could produce some beach erosion but other than the strong winds at the coast, we're not going to see flooding like we can in some of these nor'easters.Heavy, wet snow alone can create power outages, as can strong wind. Some areas will see both of these combined. This means there will be power outages in increasing frequency during Tuesday and lasting into early Wednesday before the numbers start coming down.Clearing and mild air conditions will take place for Thursday with melting snow and a return to normal conditions.",

        "body": "As commuters on the MBTA headed into a fourth day of more widespread slow zones, interim General Manager Jeff Gonneville asked for patience. \u201cWe are telling customers to give themselves about an extra 20 minutes,\u201d Gonneville told GBH Morning Edition co-hosts Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel Monday morning. \u201cNow, the trip times aren't necessarily increased by that full 20 minutes. But then as the day is progressing here, and we know as we're managing through the system \u2014 in particular train traffic \u2014 that really we want our customers to give themselves that little bit of extra time.\u201dMBTA officials had announced trains systemwide would not exceed 10 to 25 mph on Thursday night. The decision came after track testing and a visit from the Department of Public Utilities showed inconsistencies that may pose a safety risk. Usually, top speeds vary across the system, but top out at 40 mph. By mid-morning Friday, many of those slow zones were lifted. But some remained, and Gonneville said he did not have a definitive answer for riders asking how long they would be in place. \u201cWe are taking a very conservative approach as we are working through this issue,\" he said. \"We are prioritizing the safety of our customers and the safety of our employees.\u201dThe MBTA\u2019s own engineers, as well as third-party inspectors, are verifying defects in tracks DPU engineers found through ultrasonic testing, he said. The defects include slight twists in the rails, or too-tight spacing between tracks. Once the engineers have inspected a section of track, they can determine whether it needs additional repairs before they allow trains to proceed at full-speed over it. \u201cWe have multiple crews and multiple teams out across the system right now, working that through,\u201d Gonneville said. \u201cNow, it is too soon for us to predict globally when all of these restrictions will be lifted. And there very well will be corrective actions or corrective maintenance we're going to have to do in some areas as we begin to work this thing through.\u201dGonneville said he was committed to keeping riders up-to-date on developments. Thursday\u2019s announcement of system-wide slow zones did not come until 10 p.m., meaning some commuters did not see the news until they were already affected by delays. Siegel said he spoke to a T employee who said MBTA staff, too, did not get meaningful internal communication about it until late Friday morning. \u201cThis was a rapidly progressing issue that evolved Thursday afternoon,\u201d Gonneville said. \u201cImmediately after that decision was made, the T went and began implementing this slow order across the entire system. And as you can imagine, in a system that is as large and as vast as the MBTA, to implement that dramatic of a slow order, that dramatic of a change in system, takes a tremendous amount of internal coordination and internal amount of work through.\u201dGonneville encouraged riders to also use Commuter Rail stops in their regular stations. He mentioned JFK/UMass, Quincy Center, Braintree and Porter Square on the Red Line; and Back Bay, Ruggles, Forest Hills, Malden Center, and Oak Grove on the Orange Line.The system\u2019s age and high staff turnover have caused real challenges for the MBTA, he said.\u201cThis is a moment and a time where I think the full organization needs to step back in and continue to evaluate where we are and where we're going to be going as an agency,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that generational moment is going to be how the T continues to evolve and continues to really address the condition of our infrastructure and working through those processes as we are continuing to offer service on a daily basis.\u201d",

        "body": "By now my friends know that I am unavailable on Sunday at 11 a.m. I am not going to church, even though that is a typical start time for Christian church services. (As it happens, I\u2019ve been attending Bedside Baptist for a while now, but I digress.) Instead, at 11 a.m. on Sunday I\u2019m firing up my laptop and signing into Google Meet for my weekly family conversation. We started this conversation three years ago when state officials issued orders to shut down all essential businesses to stop the spread of the coronavirus. In each of our respective hometowns, my sister, twin niece and nephew and I found ourselves inside looking out. Former Gov. Charlie Baker announced the COVID shutdown in Massachusetts on March 10, 2020. Shutdowns happened 10 days later in New York where my nephew lives, and a week after that, in Minnesota where my niece lives. My sister isolated herself at home unwilling to wait for Tennessee\u2019s official stay-at-home order which didn\u2019t come until April 2.Those early days of uncertainty left us in emotional limbo. We didn\u2019t know when next we would see each other. And while the four of us in my immediate family were accustomed to living apart because of our jobs, the COVID shutdowns had a disquieting effect. We had always kept in close contact with frequent phone calls, texts and emails, but suddenly none of that seemed enough. We needed a more satisfying way to stay in touch. So, like millions of other Americans, we turned to Zoom and other video online calling services. My niece, a full stack web developer, handled the tech, setting up a one-hour Sunday call. But an hour quickly became too short, so we set aside two hours. I can\u2019t tell you how many times friends have exclaimed, \u201cTwo hours! What are you all talking about for two hours?\u201d Nothing and everything. We sign on as we are in the moment: my niece generally curled up on her couch under a blanket; my sister off camera yelling that she\u2019ll be with us when she\u2019s done fixing her tea; my nephew, the professional dancer, often bleary eyed from a recent rehearsal or performance; and me plopped on my couch or snuggled down in my big chair. Our conversations are free flowing \u2014 they ramble, overlap and punctuate whatever is on our minds \u2014 from mundane work stories to hilarious incidents, to somber observations about the state of the world, to Black Twitter\u2019s latest witty posts. Two hours fly by until we reluctantly say goodbye in an outpouring of cascading \u201cLove you\u201d and \u201cSee you next Sunday.\u201d Occasionally, each of us has had to call in from another location, or cut the time short, or miss the call altogether. But the conversation has never stopped.Because of the Sunday calls, my family and I really know each other now. We treasure family vacations and other occasions when we are in each other\u2019s company. How lucky that we found a silver lining from a global pandemic which left so many feeling lonely and disconnected. We mark the third anniversary of COVID shutdowns this month grateful for our health and our stronger family bond. Next Sunday morning can\u2019t come soon enough.",

        "body": "Jobs cuts and consolidation have local news \u2014 especially newspapers \u2014 in crisis across the country and here in Massachusetts. It's a problem for communities that lose news coverage.But there\u2019s a side of the story that is less-covered: The people who see the news gap and are doing everything they can for their communities to fill it.One of them is Nicci Kadilak, founder of the Burlington Buzz, an online publication that covers local government and current events in Burlington. Kadilak came up with the idea about a year ago, during local elections.\u201cWhat I noticed was a couple things,\u201d she said. \u201cOne: the turnout was terrible. But also, a lot of people don\u2019t have any idea what goes on in local government.\u201dShe saw an opportunity to learn more about what happens in local government and share her learnings with her community.\u201cI started it by writing Facebook posts every day, and sharing them with local resident Facebook groups,\u201d Kadilak said. \u201cAnd people liked them so much that I decided to turn it into an everyday thing.\u201dKadilak writes the Burlington Buzz on top of her day job in education, caring for her kids at home and self-publishing a novel. In a community that\u2019s seen its paper consolidated into regional coverage by Gannett, the nation\u2019s largest newspaper chain by circulation, she says it\u2019s necessary.\u201cIt\u2019s important for people to know who their neighbors are, to know who\u2019s representing them at the local level and at the state level, to know what kind of voice they have,\u201d Kadilak said. \u201cIt\u2019s also important for people to get together and realize they do actually have what it takes to be involved, and why it\u2019s important to them.\u201dSince launching the Buzz, Kadilak has seen her subscriber base grow significantly, and she says she made some money off of it, and will occasionally get recognized around town. Being a journalist is new to Kadilak, but there are other people who\u2019ve been in it for decades also venturing into the local news frontier \u2014 like Susan Petroni.When I meet Petroni, who launched the Framingham Source, at a coffee shop in Framingham she was busy breaking news on her gold Macbook, a familiar routine. \u201cI\u2019ve been a journalist since I was 16. Now, we\u2019re going on four decades,\u201d Petroni said. Her first layoff came when she was 22, at her first job as a journalist. \u201cWhen I got laid off for the fifth time, when I turned just about 50, I decided to launch my own news site,\u201d she said. \u201cI had been in the business for years and I just decided that corporate journalism wasn\u2019t really working for me.\u201dSo in 2016, she launched the Framingham Source.\u201cFramingham Source is basically a one-woman newsroom,\u201d she said. \u201cI do have interns during some semesters. But I basically cover everything in the community, from the schools to the businesses to community events to high school sports to college sports to city council meetings. I\u2019m basically out 24/7, 365 days a year.\u201dPetroni has been successful in her online venture \u2014 though she notes that work is nonstop. Residents are grateful to have a local news source in their community, she said. Over on the North Shore, Marblehead, a town of about 20,000 people, became the home of three new journalism upstarts.One of them, the Marblehead Beacon, was founded by three residents with no former journalism experience including a high school senior, Jared Letterman. \u201cThe Beacon is sort of a culmination of a lot of different things I\u2019m interested in,\u201d said Jared Letterman, the Beacon\u2019s founding editor and web designer. \u201cThere\u2019s the business side of things, which is actually what I\u2019m going to be studying in college. There\u2019s the writing piece. And there\u2019s the technology piece, that\u2019s another thing I\u2019ve always been interested in.\u201d Letterman said he hopes the news organization can serve as a beacon of hope in the dark local journalism landscape. \u201cAs far as the future of journalism, I\u2019d say as much as possible, I\u2019d like to see it run by people like us: People who are members of a town and really have a vested interest in the well-being of that town, because it removes any true profit motive from the equation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes it so that we\u2019re truly dedicated to the town, and making sure that people of the town, who we\u2019re friends with and who are our colleagues, are getting the information they deserve.\u201dNortheastern journalism professor Dan Kennedy says these new, hyperlocal organizations represent a shift in the right direction for journalism \u2014 but an unequal one.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of this in the affluent suburbs around Boston,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing less of it in some of the medium-sized cities around Boston that aren\u2019t quite as affluent.\u201dThat can be a problem for communities of color that have lost \u2014 or historically lacked \u2014 coverage, Kennedy said. But it\u2019s a void that some outlets are working to fill. Ron Bell, is a broadcaster at Boston Black News, which started as a nonprofit internet and satellite radio station in 2010 and has since expanded to include an FM station, covering current events for the Black community.\u201cMany of our community members do not know who their elected officials are. So we interview them, they get to know who they are, so they can make educated decisions at the polling locations,\u201d Bell said. \u201cI think a lot of people do not trust their local news. And people trust us.\u201dAnother independently-owned local outlet that has defied the odds: The Bay State Banner, a Black-owned local newspaper which recently saw a passing of the torch to new owners, but local ones, not a big conglomerate like Gannet \u2014 a move that Kennedy says is also cause for optimism.\u201cI\u2019m very hopeful about the future for local journalism,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cThat said, local news outlets are closing at a much faster rate than new ones are opening.\u201d",

        "body": "President Biden\u2019s decision to issue an executive order canceling some student debt was one of the defining policy moves of his presidency \u2014 and it was championed by U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Ayanna Pressley, who argued repeatedly that Biden\u2019s approach was constitutional and would have a massive social benefit. Now, though, the U.S. Supreme Court seems likely to toss out Biden\u2019s debt-relief plan. If that happens, will Warren, Pressley and other progressives pay a political price? And what will the impact be, immediately and in the years to come, on the groups that would have gained most from debt relief? Adam Reilly tackles those topics with UMass Boston political scientist Travis Johnston, who thinks a Supreme Court rejection would turn debt relief into a Democratic rallying cry, and Massachusetts Nurses Association President Katie Murphy, who says the overturning of Biden\u2019s plan could change the nursing landscape in Massachusetts for the worse. The two also discuss the recent finding, by Johnston and his UMass Boston colleague Erin O\u2019Brien, that individuals carrying student debt are less likely to participate actively in the political process. Tell us: What would the scuttling of Biden\u2019s plan mean for you? And if you have student debt, what if any effect has it had on your engagement with the political process?

        "body": "Legal advocates have called on Massachusetts authorities to launch an investigation into alleged civil rights violations against immigrants detained at the Plymouth County Correctional Facility. A civil rights complaint filed with Attorney General Andrea Campbell\u2019s office Thursday details obstacles created by the prison to block communication between detainees and legal advocates, often resulting in severe consequences for immigrants seeking legal recourse.The prison is in violation of state and federal laws by imposing severe restrictions on phone calls, video-calling access, mail access, in-person visits and access to information in languages other than English, according to the complaint. \u201cThe ability to get documents from your family and connect with an attorney on the outside can mean the difference between deportation and staying here,\u201d said Bridget Pranzatelli, a clinical student with the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program, one of the advocacy organizations that brought the complaint. \u201cIt can mean the difference between life and death.\u201d The prison prohibits all incoming calls and blocks attorneys from scheduling calls with their clients or leaving voicemails, according to the complaint. No space is provided for confidential calls, all mail is opened, and 30-minute videoconference calls cost detainees $69.99. \u201cWithout the ability to communicate with their attorneys and others to assist with their immigration cases, people in ICE custody at Plymouth are more likely to be deported to countries where they face persecution or death,\u201d the complaint said. \u201cThis is a clear and significant risk to their liberty and lives.\u201d Through a contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, immigrants are held at the facility while they await legal proceedings with \u201clife-altering consequences,\u201d advocates wrote in the complaint, filed by immigration advocacy organizations including Boston Immigration Justice Accompaniment Network, Prisoners\u2019 Legal Services of Massachusetts, Massachusetts Reform Institute, MIRA Coalition, and New Haven Legal Assistance Association. Citing violations of procedural protections afforded to detainees via Massachusetts state laws, advocates called on the civil rights division of Campbell\u2019s office to launch an investigation. The Attorney General\u2019s office has received the complaint and started a review, according to a spokesperson for Campbell. The prison\u2019s contract with ICE expires pending renewal in September, according to the complaint. If the alleged civil rights violations aren\u2019t amended, advocates encouraged the Attorney General to terminate the facility\u2019s ICE contract and release the 37 detained immigrants currently being held at the facility. A spokesperson for the Plymouth County Sheriff's Office, which oversees the prison, declined to answer questions about the specific allegations detailed in the complaint. \u201cIf the attorney general opens an investigation, we will cooperate fully and demonstrate that the Department fully respects the rights of the people committed to its care and custody,\u201d Plymouth County public information deputy director Karen Barry said in a statement. Mario Noe Paredes, an attorney with Prisoners\u2019 Legal Services of Massachusetts, says he received a call in 2021 from a detainee at the prison, asking for his help. The detainee, who Paredes declined to name, alleged that he had been pepper sprayed and beaten by officers who slammed his face on the floor of his solitary confinement cell. When Paredes came to document the man\u2019s wounds, he said prison officials told him photography was not permitted. Paredes was initially denied an in-person visitation he said, but was allowed to speak with his client through glass in a phone booth. The phone system wasn\u2019t working, Paredes said, forcing him to communicate as best he could by yelling through the glass. \u201cI had to yell to this individual from across the glass, trying to communicate as best I could,\u201d Paredes said. \u201cWhen I tried to pass information about his rights to him, I was also disallowed from handing him any documentation that outlined what his rights were.\u201d Paredes says he lost contact with the man who initially sought his help. Losing touch with clients is a common conclusion in many cases involving detained immigrants, Paredes says, in a process where access is rare and limited. \u201cA lot of the abuses go unreported, because when people start speaking up against what they are facing, they are retaliated against, sometimes by being placed in segregation, sometimes by being transferred out of state,\u201d Paredes said, adding that many immigrants face language barriers and are not adequately informed of their rights. \u201cIf you add communication issues, it becomes pretty much impossible for some folks to make contact with the outside world and find the support and resources that they need.\u201d Legal advocacy organizations have filed multiple complaints against the Plymouth County Correctional Facility in previous years, including one last year with the Department of Homeland Security that includes testimony from detained individuals struggling to communicate with their lawyers or family members. \u201cPhone is expensive \u2026 I spend $150 a week just on phone,\u201d a detained individual said in the 2022 complaint. \u201cHere they try to make it as hard as possible for you so you get deported.\u201dPrevious complaints allege civil rights violations including a lack of adequate medical care, unsanitary prison conditions and deficient COVID-19 protocols. Issues that impact every aspect of life in detention are \u201cintentionally withheld\u201d from public knowledge, said Pranzatelli.\u201cThe nature of these civil rights violations is that they block people on the outside from seeing what's going on inside,\u201d she said, adding that the yearslong investigation into protocols at the prison was a process of \u201cpeeling back one curtain at a time.\u201d Unlike detainees in criminal custody, who have the right to government-appointed counsel, immigration detention is a civil proceeding, meaning detainees must pay for their own lawyers or find free counsel. Only 37% of all immigrants and 14% of detained immigrants have legal representation, according to a 2016 American Immigration Council study. \u201cOne thing that seems to be constantly lost in all of this is that this is not criminal, these are not people who are even being accused of a criminal violation, just a civil violation, and yet they're being punished and being denied any opportunity for due process,\u201d MIRA Coalition political director Sarang Sekhavat said. \u201cThese kinds of abuses that we see, it's not just Plymouth. It's everywhere.\u201d",

        "body": "The first year of a fare-free bus pilot program in Boston has led to significant savings for many low-income MBTA riders, according to a mid-program report conducted by the city.City officials launched the expanded two-year pilot for the 23, 28 and 29 routes in March of 2022 after initially launching free fares on the 28 in 2021. Over the course of the pilot, 42 percent of riders have saved money, with 26 percent saving $20 or more, according to the city.\u201cFare-free buses are better buses\u201d, Chief of Streets Jascha Franklin-Hodge said. \u201cIt really does add up, especially for lower income households.\"The 23, 28 and 29 routes primarily serve residents of Roxbury, Dorchester and Mattapan. According to the report, most riders are considered \u201ctransit critical,\u201d meaning they are residents who are low-income, people of color, seniors, people with disabilities or who live in households with few or no vehicles. The report found that much of the money saved by riders has been used to purchase food, save towards long-term goals and build emergency funds. \u201cThese routes serve a part of the Boston population that really depends on transit to meet their daily needs,\u201d Franklin-Hodge said. \u201cIf there\u2019s any group of folks that you want to make sure a program like this serves, it\u2019s the people who need it most.\"While 26 percent of riders have seen what city officials have deemed significant savings, that leaves nearly three-quarters who have not. Franklin-Hodge attributes that to the fact that the majority of the MBTA still costs money, and the majority of riders on the 23, 28 and 29 routes need to take other buses and trains. If more lines were free, savings would be even more significant, he said, adding that shows the necessity of making transit more accessible.The progress report also highlights the way fare-free transit has led to positive lifestyle changes for riders. \u201cI go to visit my sister more and my daughter more because it\u2019s on a straight route,\u201d one rider who participated in a focus group said. \u201cThe 28 picks me up and drops me off down the street at my sister\u2019s house.\u201dA recent GBH news report analyzing ridership data before and after the launch of the pilot programs found that ridership has increased significantly since the launch of free fares, and that the fare-free lines have seen bumps in speed and ridership that buck the trend of the MBTA as a whole. The new city assessment confirms a significant bump in ridership since the pilots launched and highlights the speed benefits of going fare free.\u201cIt reduces the stress of the bus riding experience,\u201d Franklin-Hodge said. \u201cWe have video. You can see, at some of the big stations \u2026 the speed at which you can get a full busload of passengers and get everybody on their way is night and day.\u201dThe fare free pilot is a two-year program set to remain in place through February 2024. The city of Boston is funding the program with $8 million in federal funds distributed through the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) to reimburse the MBTA.It\u2019s unclear what the future of fare-free transit holds in Boston, but Franklin-Hodge said he and other city officials remain hopeful that they will be able to expand programs in the future \u2014 and he said the data from the pilot program will be helpful in proving the efficacy of free public transportation.\u201cWhere can we make further investments to give the best bang for the buck for people who rely on the MBTA?\u201d Franklin-Hodge said. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to push that conversation forward with leaders at the state level and here locally in the city of Boston.\u201d",

        "body": "Ahead of his first-ever jury service, GBH\u2019s Morning Edition co-host Jeremy Siegel asked legal analyst and Northeastern law professor Daniel Medwed about the history and the current-day practice of jury trials. This transcript has been lightly edited. Jeremy Siegel: So, Daniel, in two days, I am going to be part of a jury, potentially part of a jury. I have to report for jury duty, which is something I've actually never had to do in my whole life. Daniel Medwed: Is this congratulations or condolences? Siegel: Yeah, I think more condolences in my case. I'm not actually super excited to potentially be doing jury duty. Medwed: To fulfill your civic duty, Jeremy. Siegel: Well, that's true. I guess I will be fulfilling my civic duty as an American citizen. So tell me a little bit about how that became a thing. Why is it a thing that I have to do jury duties? What's the background and the history of how this became a thing in America? Medwed: Sure. Like so many aspects of our legal system, we inherited it from Ye Olde England, and the first juries in England date back to the Middle Ages. They were called juries of recognition, and they were used in land disputes. Members of the community would come forward to recognize, from memory, who had received title to particular parcels of land from William the Conqueror. That's sort of the origin. And then by the 1400s, it evolved, and it looked a little bit like it looks today, where juries serve as finders of fact. They collect evidence, they evaluate the evidence, they weigh the credibility of witnesses, and ultimately render a verdict. So the right to a jury trial now in the United States is enshrined in our Constitution. For criminal cases, it's in the Sixth Amendment and for civil cases, where a certain amount of money is at stake, it's in the Seventh Amendment. Siegel: So I'm hearing that I have England and William the Conqueror to thank for my jury duty. Medwed: Exactly. It's a straight throughline from William the Conqueror to Jeremy Siegel. Siegel: So I know that juries aren't the case for every criminal situation. Someone can waive their right to a jury and try their luck before a judge too, right? Why would that be the case? Medwed: On the one hand, the rule of the road essentially is: If you're in a criminal case in particular, and the facts are really gory, really gruesome, a defendant might opt for a judge \u2014 it's called a bench trial \u2014 instead of a jury, based on the idea that the judge has sort of seen it all and won't be swayed by the gruesome, gory details of the case; can be more objective and dispassionate; and dispense justice in a way that might be more measured than a jury, that could be inflamed by these facts. On the other hand, that calculus differs depending on the orientation of the judge. If the judge is really punitive, really tough on crime, it might be a very different equation. And you might want to go with a jury even in a case with bad facts, because all you have to do is get one juror on your side to vote to acquit. Then you can hang the jury and get a mistrial. Siegel: Okay. So that was actually going to be the next thing that I asked about here: in order to be convicted of something, or to be acquitted, you need everybody in the jury to be on the same page?Medwed: Yes. This idea of jury unanimity in criminal cases is an interesting one. And actually the Supreme Court only resolved it definitively relatively recently, in a 2020 case called Ramos. So here's the background: In Ye Olde England, common law unanimity was the norm. You had to have unanimous juries in criminal cases. And there's an instance of one of these from like 1367. And this idea of unanimity crossed the pond, and it's a part of federal law and virtually every state law. However \u2014 and this is what sort of interesting \u2014 there is nothing in the Constitution explicitly that talked about unanimous juries in criminal cases. So Louisiana and Oregon were outliers for a long time, and they allowed people to be convicted based on votes that are 10-to-2 or 11-to-1 in favor of conviction. They both backtracked. Those states have backtracked from that in part because the Supreme Court, in that 2020 case I mentioned, finally said, hey, you know what, the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial under our federal Constitution implicitly carries a requirement that the jury verdict be unanimous. And therefore, we should have unanimous juries in the states as well. That hasn't stopped Florida and Governor Ron DeSantis from making waves about going back to non-unanimous juries. But I think as a matter of constitutional law, it seems like unanimous juries are here to stay in the criminal case context, at least. Siegel: So, Daniel, as you were talking about people coming to a consensus, everybody agreeing on something in order for there to be an acquittal or a conviction, it made me think about how difficult that could be for a bunch of ordinary citizens performing their civic duty, and all of the debate that happens behind closed doors between jurors. I guess I'm curious about why someone who gets caught up in the criminal justice system for one reason or another and ends up in a jury trial \u2014 why should we trust the system, at the end of the day?Medwed: I'm not so sure we do. So here's the theory is this, and then we'll talk about the practice. The theory is that you bring 12 fair and impartial citizens who represent a cross-section of the community harmed by the crime, usually within the county, the jurisdiction. If you bring them all together, they'll bring their disparate experiences to the fore, and through a full and frank conversation in the deliberation room, without outside influence, without outside supervision, they'll arrive at a just outcome. That's sort of the theory. You get 12 different people from our very diverse country, bring them all together in a room to talk about facts, and essentially a good result will occur. But the practice is much uglier than that, right? Because there are a lot of tools in the tool chest of prosecutors in particular to shape the jury in a particular way. There's a very sordid history in the United States of prosecutors using what are called peremptory challenges \u2014 you can challenge jurors for no articulable reason in criminal cases \u2014 that they were challenged based on racial bias. For instance, in a case involving a Black defendant, prosecutors would often try to craft all-white juries. There have been Supreme Court cases that have said you can't do this, but there are a lot of pernicious activities that could be done. Also, another reality of this, of course, is that 12 people in a room won't necessarily all have their voices heard and respected equally. There might be one person who dominates the conversation. It's sort of unclear what the dynamics of the deliberation room might be. So I'm actually pretty skeptical about whether juries work or not. Siegel: So real quick, Daniel, before I let you go, let's say someone, after having this conversation wasn't too excited about their jury duty coming up in a couple days. And in theory, let's say you wanted to get off of a jury. How would you go about doing that? Medwed: I can't imagine anyone would want to do that. Certainly nobody that I know and talk with at least weekly would ever want to do that. I think, Jeremy, essentially you can be excused what's called for cause, if there is some cause. If you have a conflict of interest, you have a financial stake in the case, you know one of the parties \u2014 that's sort of easy. You're going to get bounced for that. If you have a clear time commitment that makes it impossible for you to serve, a judge might actually allow you to leave as well. If you express misgivings about the case, for instance, you say, 'I could never convict somebody. I don't believe in criminal justice. I don't believe in prison.' That might also be a basis for getting a bounced. Unfortunately, Jeremy, being the co-host of Morning Edition isn't necessarily an excuse because you have Paris who can help out. You are indispensable to us, but, you know, possibly you could have one day off or one week off to do your civic duty.",

        "body": "Updated at 5:48 p.m.SeparatorPITTSFIELD, Mass. (AP) \u2014 A winter storm dumped heavy, wet snow in parts of the Northeast on Tuesday, causing tens of thousands of power outages, widespread school closings, dangerous driving conditions and a plane to slide off a taxiway.The storm's path included parts of New England, upstate New York, northeastern Pennsylvania and northern New Jersey. Snow totals by the time it winds up Wednesday were expected to range from a few inches to a few feet, depending on the area.About two feet of snow fell in parts of northern New York and the Catskill Mountains, and Gov. Kathy Hochul said some areas could get an additional foot of snow by Wednesday morning. In New Hampshire, state police asked drivers to stay off the roads Tuesday afternoon due to whiteout conditions. State Police said they had dealt with more than 120 crashes.In Derry, New Hampshire, firefighters and police officers used chain saws, shovels and their bare hands to rescue a girl who was trapped under a fallen tree. Authorities said the girl had been playing outside near a parent who was clearing snow when the tree fell on her. The girl was taken to a hospital with minor injuries.All northbound lanes of Interstate 95 on the Piscataqua River Bridge between Maine and New Hampshire were shut down after two tractor trailer trucks became stuck on the bridge due to icy conditions.In the Berkshires in western Massachusetts, heavy, wet snow made driving treacherous, weighing down tree limbs and causing several spinouts. The storm dumped at least a foot of wintry mix in some areas.Further east in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, where as much as 18 inches of snow was reported to have fallen, Jean Guerrer said the conditions were too dangerous for him to drive to work as a Boston-based taxi driver.Peter Davis, a semiretired commercial roofer, relished in the snowstorm, breaking out his new snow blower. But an hour into the snow removal, a piece of asphalt thrown onto the sidewalk by a snow plow got stuck in his new snow blower and broke a shear pin, forcing him to go repair the equipment.A Delta Air Lines plane veered off a paved surface as it taxied for takeoff from a Syracuse, New York, airport Tuesday morning. Flight 1718, which was bound for New York City\u2019s LaGuardia Airport, slid into a grassy area north of the runway, forcing passengers off the plane and onto buses back to the terminal, according to airport officials. No one was injured and the airport remained open.\u201cDuring a departure taxi-out this morning, the nose gear of a Delta aircraft exited the paved surface of a taxiway,\u201d Delta said in a statement. \u201cThis was not an airplane skidding off a runway.\u201dDelta said the plane carried 58 customers and a flight crew of five.More than 400 flights traveling to, from or within the U.S. were canceled Tuesday, with Boston and New York City area airports seeing the highest number of scrubbed flights, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware.The National Weather Service said that in New York, 2 inches (5 centimeters) of snow per hour or more was falling in higher elevations in the eastern Catskills through the mid-Hudson Valley, central Taconics and Berkshires. Wet, heavy snow snapped tree branches and downed power lines across New York\u2019s capital region with power outages hitting homes and businesses in the Albany area.Dustin Reidy, a county legislator who lives in Albany, said he stocked up on groceries and prepared an emergency bin of candles, flashlights, and extra batteries ahead of the storm.\u201cI don\u2019t think the storm is as bad in my neck of the woods, but I give a lot of credit to the snow plows,\u201d said Reidy, who was working from home. He said snow plows crews were outside since early morning to ensure roads were clear.The snowfall totals will be among the highest of the season, said meteorologist Andrew Orrison of the weather service office in College Park, Maryland.\u201cIt has been below average for snowfall across the Northeast this year, and so this nor'easter will be very impactful,\" he said.While higher elevations get snow, authorities warned residents in coastal areas to watch for possible flooding because of heavy rains. The National Weather Service in New York said wind gusts could reach 50 mph across Long Island and lower Connecticut.Rain was turning into snow across parts of New England with winds picking up and power outages reported across the region. In New Hampshire, it was Election Day for town officeholders, but more than 70 communities postponed voting because of the storm.In Kingston, New Hampshire, police offered voters rides to the polls. In Weare, power was knocked out at the polling place, forcing officials to set up battery-powered lights until a generator could be brought in. Interstate 93, the state\u2019s main north-south route, was shut down in Londonderry in both directions around 12:30 p.m. after electrical wires came down across the highway.In Connecticut, state government offices and courts were closed Tuesday. State offices were also closed in New York.The weather service said expected snow totals from the storm, which is forecast to wind up Wednesday, range from more than 2 feet in higher elevations in New York, New Hampshire and western Massachusetts, to 4 to 6 inches in Boston.SeparatorMcCormack reported from Concord, New Hampshire.

        "body": "Massachusetts hospitals paid a staggering $1.52 billion last year to hire temporary hospital workers, mostly \u201ctravel nurses,\u201d amid a labor shortage that contributed to record financial losses for many institutions. The exponential growth of labor costs is included in a new report issued by the Massachusetts Health and Hospital Association on Monday. The report shows in fiscal year 2019, prior to the pandemic, hospitals spent $204 million on temporary staff. That number skyrocketed in FY2022 to $1.52 billion \u2014 a 610% increase. \u201cIt is staggering,\u201d said Daniel McHale, vice president of healthcare finance at MHA. \u201cAnd ... it\u2019s not unique to Massachusetts.\u201d McHale, who helped prepare the report, cited a Massachusetts Center for Health Information and Analysis report that found four in five hospitals lost money during the last fiscal year. \u201cThe net result is financial losses for hospitals,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, we\u2019ve had the worst kind of financial performance in many years, even during the pandemic years.\u201d Another MHA report, issued in October, estimated that there are 19,000 vacancies at hospitals across the state. Nurses have gone on strike across the country to protest low staff-to-patient ratios and poor working conditions, from the monthslong strike at St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital in Worcester to New York City, where 7,000 nurses walked off the job in January. Throughout the pandemic, many hospitals hired registered nurses and other hospital staff through \u201ctraveler\u201d agencies to fill gaps \u2014 temporary gigs that often paid much higher hourly salaries than what staff nurses and clinicians earned. It\u2019s a dynamic that can create resentment among staff nurses, on top of the burden to hospital budgets, as GBH News previously reported. At UMass Memorial Health in Worcester, CFO, vice president and treasurer Sergio Melgar said his health care system went into FY 2022 with 600 open jobs, and filling those vacancies with temporary workers was expensive. In some cases, he said, traveling workers were paid triple times the cost of pre-COVID rates.Though the added expense was a significant financial stress, he said that, with an increase in patient volume and lack of staff, their health care system had no choice. \u201cIt can cost us up to $20 million a month to get these personnel to come in because we have the patients, and we are the provider for central Massachusetts,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, we actively made that decision that we are going to do it in the short term, see how it evolves.\u201d Melgar said costs have since come down, but in fiscal year 2022, UMass Memorial spent more than $150 million in temporary labor costs. At Sturdy Memorial Hospital in Attleboro, Chief Strategy Officer Justine Zilliken said the workforce shortage coupled with the bruising reality of the COVID-19 pandemic forced her hospital to lean on temporary labor. \u201cContract labor isn\u2019t only nursing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing incredible shortages in therapists and other ancillary service members, as well.\u201d Zilliken said, in fiscal year 2022, Sturdy Memorial had contract labor expenses climb from less than $2 million annually pre-pandemic to $14 million. \u201cAs you can imagine, that\u2019s a staggering impact on any care system, let alone your independent community serving health system,\u201d she said.Many hospitals offered extensive signing bonuses and retention packages to keep employees. A recent survey from the Massachusetts Medical Society found that one in four Massachusetts doctors plan to leave medicine in the next two years, causing more concerns about the future stability of the state\u2019s health care workforce. \u201cEveryone has really been pummeled by the workforce shortage, people opting out of health care careers and leaving their careers,\u201d Zilliken said. \u201cEveryone is struggling. Everyone is feeling the financial impact and the morale impact of the contract labor necessities.\u201d Zilliken and Melgar said increased labor costs are not an expense that gets passed on to patients, but rather it's paid by the hospital system that delivers the care it\u2019s committed to giving. So far, hospitals have had to absorb the financial losses. It\u2019s a policy area that the MHA report highlights as needing change to overcome exponential health care costs. Steve Walsh, MHA\u2019s president and CEO, said Massachusetts\u2019 cost-growth benchmark \u2014 set up in the state to cap health care costs \u2014 is no longer an adequate way to assess the current health system. Walsh said the traveler agencies and temporary worker trend demands a policy re-focus. \u201cThe cost pressures thrust upon hospitals and health systems within the past several years \u2014 particularly around temporary staffing \u2014 have simply become too pervasive to ignore.\u201d",

        "body": "Standing with a crowd of around 300 people outside the Massachusetts State House, the Rev. Lydia Shiu of Reservoir Church in Cambridge evoked an enduring metaphor \u2014 that of David taking on the giant Goliath in the Bible \u2014 as she spoke of the commonwealth's housing challenges.Shiu helped lead a Greater Boston Interfaith Organization rally Thursday, where the coalition of religious groups and unions called on state leaders to make housing more affordable and accessible. She said the \u201cGBIO sling\u201d had secured past policy wins in health care and criminal justice reform. \u201cThis is not just a housing crisis. This is a human crisis,\u201d Shiu said. \u201cAnd although the housing crisis purports itself to be a complex and complicated problem \u2014 and yes, folks, it is a hairy one \u2014 but in the face of Goliath, you cannot mess with the faith and hope of David.\u201d With its members clad in blue T-shirts, playing trombones, and holding signs with slogans like \u201cPraying with Our Feet,\u201d GBIO launched a new housing justice campaign. The campaign pushes for greater state investment in public housing, zoning reforms to encourage multifamily housing in suburbs, and housing support for formerly incarcerated people. GBIO also backs legislation that would let communities impose a new fee on certain real estate transactions, with proceeds going toward affordable housing. Under the bills, filed by Cambridge Rep. Mike Connolly and Northampton Sen. Jo Comerford, cities and towns that opt in could impose a fee of between 0.5% and 2% of the purchase price on some property sales.Municipalities could choose whether the seller or buyer pays the fee, or split it between the two. The fee would kick in only above a certain price threshold: either $1 million, or above the county's median sale price for single-family homes.Communities including Boston, Somervile, Arlington and Nantucket have sought Beacon Hill's permission to establish transfer taxes in the past, but the concept has faced opposition for years from real estate industry officials, who argue the additional fee would raise costs for buyers. Phil Hillman, a strategy leader at GBIO and member of St. Paul A.M.E. Church, said the interfaith organization supports transfer tax legislation because it knows new revenue sources will be necessary before communities can create more affordable housing.\"I have seen the impact of this housing crisis on my Dorchester community. This is a type of crisis that has touched family members, friends, coworkers [and] congregations,\" he said. \"For decades, our housing production has not kept up with our job growth. This has resulted in skyrocketing rents, huge increases in housing prices. If you are low-income \u2014 lower middle income \u2014 the dream of homeownership has become a nightmare.\"After rallying outside the State House, GBIO members planned to meet with lawmakers and staff, asking them to support the bills and funding requests that make up the organization\u2019s housing justice campaign. The organization wants lawmakers to double the amount of money Gov. Maura Healey proposed for public housing in her budget proposal. Healey's budget funds the public housing authorities' account at $92 million for next year, the same amount that was in this year's budget.At Thursday's rally, Arlene Hill described what it meant for her to move into public housing after spending time at a homeless shelter.\u201cThe ability to lock that door and be in my apartment, with no one telling me I had to do this or that, saved my life,\u201d she said. GBIO said it will move forward with several action items, and that its members plan to attend committee hearings as lawmakers vet the bills on their agenda.",

        "body": "The owner of a chain of Massachusetts pizza restaurants was arrested Thursday for allegedly forcing a worker to labor long hours for little pay while being threatened with deportation and facing severe verbal and physical abuse.Stavros Papantoniadis \u2014 who owns local restaurants called Stash\u2019s Pizza in Dorchester and Roslindale \u2014 was charged later the same day with forced labor in U.S. federal court and detained pending a detention hearing scheduled for next week, according to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office. Charging documents detail harrowing accounts of alleged abuse. One victim claims he worked for Papantoniadis for nearly 14 years, 12 hours a day, seven days a week, without ever taking a vacation. He says he was kicked, slapped, choked and assaulted so severely he had to have his teeth removed and wear dentures. He says he believed he couldn\u2019t leave because he was undocumented and worried his employer would report him to immigration authorities.U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins said in a press release that it is a federal crime to force someone to work through the use of \u201cforce, threats of force, or coercion.\u201d She urged anyone with information about abuse to reach out to her office. \u201cThe allegations in this case are horrific. Nobody has the right to violently kick, slap, punch or choke anyone, and certainly not an employer to an employee,\u2019\u2019 Rollins said. \u201cThis case illustrates the manipulative, violent and abusive tactics some employers utilize for their own greed and financial gain.\u201dThis is the first case of forced labor filed by the U.S. attorney\u2019s office since Rollins took up the job last year. Since then, she has created a human trafficking unit focusing on sex and labor violations. The problem of forced labor, often hidden in plain sight, has been the topic of an ongoing investigation by the GBH News Center for Investigative Reporting. GBH News reporters have spoken with restaurant and construction workers and domestic cleaners, among others, who have detailed working long hours for little or no pay, fearful of deportation, abuse and even homelessness. \u201cForced labor is a form of human trafficking.

        "body": "A progressive college in Western Massachusetts made a pitch to Florida students who are fed up with Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis' policies: come north.\"We can offer you a sanctuary,\" Hampshire College President Ed Wingenbach said.The offer is meant to attract students of New College on the shores of Sarasota Bay. Florida's governor has repeatedly complained about \u201cwoke culture\u201d on New College's campus. He replaced six members of the state college's 13 board of trustees with conservatives who said they intended to remake the school in the likeness of Hillsdale College, a Christian college in Michigan with a politically conservative bent. DeSantis has also enacted new state rules that ban instruction on gender identity and sexual orientation and limit what schools can teach about racism. Hampshire College, where students do not receive letter grades and do not announce majors, said it will admit all students \"in good standing\" from New College and match the school's tuition: $6,916 for in-state plus fees, and $29,944 for out-of-state students. New College officials and DeSantis' office did not respond to requests for comment. Like Hampshire College, New College allows students to design their own curriculum. The college said it's committed to free speech, inclusion and social justice, describing itself as \u201ca community of free thinkers.\u201d Hampshire's Wingenbach called it a \"sibling\" school.Wingenbach, a former political science professor, said DeSantis and new board members at the Florida college are now trying to overhaul the curriculum, which spurred him to action.\"Those of us who care about the ability of higher education to support democratic citizenship have to start doing something to push back, because this isn't going to stop,\" he said. The move would also help Hampshire, based in Amherst, Massachusetts. It has fewer than 500 students enrolled this semester, and has suffered from the same financial and demographic challenges facing many small private colleges. The college enlisted help from documentary filmmaker and alum Ken Burns to raise money to stay afloat.Lynn Pasquerella, president of the American Association of Colleges and Universities, said Hampshire's offer is the first of its kind. And she added that she hopes other colleges follow its lead.\"There's real concern on the part of educators across the country about the very existence of American higher education,\u201d Pasquerella said. \"It's not enough to decry these attacks on academic freedom and shared governance. Leaders at colleges and universities need to act individually and collectively and Hampshire is leading the way and really living their mission.\"Hampshire said four New College students have already accepted its admission offer since it was announced on its website last week, and at least 20 others have asked for more information.",

        "body": "The latest iteration of The State of Race, a collaboration between GBH, The World, The Boston Globe and the Boston NAACP, will tackle the question: Are women of color on the rise? GBH\u2019s Morning Edition co-host Paris Alston be moderating the panel of women leaders making waves and tackling challenges in the realms of health care, academia, business policy and government. One of the panelists, Eneida Rom\u00e1n, the CEO of Amplify Latinx, joined Paris to talk ahead of the event. This transcript has been lightly edited. The State of Race: Are Women of Color on the Rise? will be held Thursday at 6 p.m. Free virtual tickets are available. Paris Alston: Thank you so much for joining us. And I want to talk about the event and everything that we're going to discuss. But first, I know that you are new in your role at Amplify Latinx. So tell me how things have been going and what your priorities are. Eneida Rom\u00e1n: Thank you so much, Paris. I'm delighted to be here, and I'm delighted to be part of the conversation tonight. As you said, I am new to my role at Amplify as CEO, but I'm not new to Amplify. I'm actually one of the co-founders. It's really delightful for me to see how we've grown and how we've expanded our reach. And so our goal is to actually close those opportunity gaps for Latinos and for women and other people of color through legislation that makes sense, through policy solutions that address these opportunity gaps. Alston: I'm glad you mentioned that, because I know that earlier this week you were at the State House, along with a number of other advocates and policymakers who were pushing for salary transparency bills that would require companies with 15 or more employees in Massachusetts to post their salary ranges and share the salaries of their employees. Tell me a little bit about how that will help level the playing field and what are the disparities that exist currently. Rom\u00e1n: That's an excellent question because there is a disparity, despite the fact that we had a wage equity bill passed in the past. This is a little bit different. And I just want to clarify that we can pass these bills without putting an employer at a competitive disadvantage and without burdensome reporting requirements. Because what we're asking is for employers of 100 employees or more to actually share with the state information that they already share with the federal government. The other bill is focused on posting the salary ranges for job openings. And there's at least a dozen other states who are doing this already. So in Massachusetts, we always pride ourselves on being innovative and being ahead of the curve, and being progressive when it comes to equity and inclusion. So this would be another way of ensuring that we are at the top of the game. Alston: You know, it's interesting, Eneida, because I think back to some of my early days and those conversations about salary negotiations were very foreign to me in many ways. I'm curious about your perspective about how that holds women of color back, and why it is important for people to be able to be transparent about these things. Rom\u00e1n: Absolutely. You're right, because I think that money tends to be a taboo subject for so many of us, and also negotiating on our behalf. I think as women, we're always taught that we want to take care of others, but we kind of put ourselves in the backseat. And I think that also translates into how we negotiate on behalf of others, but not so much on our behalf. And so it's very interesting how we can distinguish between fairness and deserving something, right? As women, we tend to focus on, \"Well, that's fair.\" It's not so much that \"I deserve it.\" And I think there's a gender difference there where when a man is talking about his salary, he describes it as him being worthy of it. And so I think it's important that we normalize talking about our worth and about making sure that it's not selfish. It's something that benefits society in general. It benefits all of us because it it improves the GDP of the nation. It improves the economic prosperity of our families and the security of our homes. I think focusing on, normalizing the subject, and not seeing it as the taboo, because that, in fact, is something that really has affected our ability to negotiate on our behalf, on our own progress. Alston: It's interesting that we're going to be tackling this question tonight, as I mentioned: Are women of color on the rise? Because we see them in a number of leadership positions, including the one that you're in. We see them in state and federal government. We see them in higher education and in the business sector, etc., etc. But where do the disparities remain? Rom\u00e1n: First of all, the pay equity gap has not improved in 20 years, Right? So that's a reality. That's for women in general. Now, when you look at the pay equity gap for women generally, white women make $0.70 for every dollar their white [male] counterparts make. Now, if we start looking at that, at the numbers, the gap from April until the end of the year, we see that women of color fall even further behind. And so, of course, my focus is on Latinas. And in the work that I do, we see that Latinas literally make half of what their white counterparts make. So they essentially end up working double the time for the same amount of pay. This is due to a number of factors. There's many more Latinas and women of color in entry level positions. So of course the salaries are lower, and so the pathway to the top sometimes has certain obstacles. I think by creating this awareness and by finding policy solutions that help remove the barriers, we clear that path and we remove those roadblocks for women and women of color.",

        "body": "The Federal Aviation Administration held a safety summit in Washington Wednesday following a series of safety-related incidents at airports across the country. At the summit, the recent dramatic increase in air travel and the need for better technology were cited as reasons for the rising number of close calls. But Logan Airport \u2014 where one of those recent incidents occurred \u2014 is one of 43 airports across the country that have been outfitted by the FAA with the latest technology to deter potential collisions.On Feb. 27, a LearJet began taking off on a runway at Logan Airport that crossed the landing path of an arriving JetBlue flight. The JetBlue plane suddenly aborted its landing to avoid collision. The circumstances that led to this close hall are still under investigation by the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board.David Ishihara, director of aviation services at Logan, attended the FAA safety summit. On Thursday, he explained to Massport\u2019s board that Logan was an early adopter of two safety systems to help prevent collisions. One is a ground-based radar that allows pilots to see both vehicles and other airplanes on the ground. It also will alert the pilot and control tower if an airplane on final approach is not headed for the runway on which it is cleared to land. The other safety system is a network of runway status lights installed along taxiways and runways throughout the airport. They flash red and warn pilots of potential conflicts between planes taking off and landing. Ishihara said that light system will be expanded this summer. Massport Director of Aviation Ed Freni reminded the board that all the radar systems that Ishihara referenced are maintained and installed by the FAA and not within Massport\u2019s control.",

        "body": "Thursday marks the three-year anniversary since the first Moderna mRNA COVID vaccine was injected into a human for its phase one trial. The vaccine was the culmination of work from scientists around the world, including top immunologists and public health experts here in the U.S. and in Massachusetts. One of those scientists that played a major role in developing the vaccine is Dr. Kizzmekia Corbett, assistant professor of immunology and infectious diseases at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. She joined GBH's Morning Edition co-host Paris Alston to talk about the anniversary and her work on the vaccine. This transcript has been lightly edited. Paris Alston: I'm so glad that you're joining us this morning. Thank you. Happy anniversary to you, I suppose I should say. Thinking back to that day three years ago when that first dose was injected, what was that like for you as someone who had helped develop that vaccine, to see it going into someone's arm? Dr. Kizzmekia Corbett: It was an absolutely surreal moment, and I do think happy anniversary is appropriate. I actually do celebrate this as if it is an anniversary for me. I don't think that when we started developing the vaccine in the beginning of January that we envisioned that there would even be a pandemic, and certainly that we envisioned that we would have such dire weight on our shoulders around the middle of March. And so it was just so surreal to see that vaccine going into someone's arm. Alston: And now, millions of people across the world have those vaccines, and things feel more manageable, at least, as a result. And clearly, a lot has changed since that moment, since that first dose, and we have better understandings. As everyday people, we sort of understand mRNA a little bit more now, and we know that there are other health care developments that have happened as a result of this COVID vaccine. But how have things changed for you as an immunologist? Do you look at things differently now? Corbett: I certainly look at things differently. I really now take a very worldly approach to all the work that I do. Back then, when I was studying coronaviruses, I was doing it from a very basic science approach. And now when my lab at Harvard asks questions about coronaviruses and other viruses, I really look at how this will affect public health, how our work will really inform the betterment of health and wellness for, really, everyone. That moment proved to me that we are not isolated, and that anything that is a product out of my science should be informing the health of everyone, really.Alston: And to that point, you are very well known for your use of social media to inform the public about health and health care issues, and things that you're working on. How do you balance doing that on a platform like, say, Twitter, with also making sure that what you're saying doesn't get misconstrued, misinterpreted and that sort of thing? Corbett: Delicately. Or even or even barely, I should say. You know, I think that the one thing about Twitter, as can be said about text messages or anything that is not spoken verbally with tone, is that anyone can read it how they feel. And so what I do is I just really try to, when I am relaying information about science or the vaccines, to really just try to stick to the facts and leave my opinion out of it and things of that nature. And I think that tends to help. I think when people come to me, whether it be, is it time to get a new booster? Should I be vaccinating my children? Or all of these questions, I think when they come to my Twitter page, they're really looking for a very verbatim fact. And so I try to give them that. Alston: And I also just want to point out, I know that that equity and racial equity in terms of how we have dealt with the coronavirus, as well as the vaccine rollout, has been something that you've discussed as well. And to that point, do you think that the general public, including the people who you were trying to relay that specific information to, has a better understanding now of how viruses work and how immunology works and how infectious diseases spread? Corbett: I do I think that overall, everyone has lived through school, so to speak, a virology crash course, over the last three years or so where each of us was really almost thrust into this moment where we had no choice but to learn about viruses and immunology and all of those things in order to make the best decisions for ourselves. And it was difficult. It was a difficult time to be in the pandemic and to be learning things in such real time. But I will say that I think that everyone came out of it better. I find that people will even, as I talk to people about their seasonal flu vaccines, for example, people are a little bit more even informed about how those work, because now everyone is really interested in understanding vaccine technology and essentially what is going into their body. Alston: And thanks to the vaccine, we are sort of in this era where we're re-emerging, right? I mean, both Massachusetts and the federal government are on the cusp of ending their public health emergencies this May. And as we do that, some are also still cautioning that the pandemic is not over. People are still catching COVID and other infectious diseases or viral diseases. So how should we be approaching the pandemic at this juncture? Corbett: You know, I think that what is being said around ending the emergency declaration is that we are not in the same time that we were in three years ago. And I think that we can all appreciate that we're living differently. COVID disease, generally in healthy adult people, is milder now. I think that what we have to do is, maybe even if it's not an emergency declaration, still approach COVID-19 and other viral diseases with caution always. And my hope is that the ending of the emergency declaration does not relay the message that we must end caution. And I'm hoping that to the public health, that the federal government and Massachusetts government, that we really relay that with very fine point. Otherwise people will take it like it's over. And it most certainly is not. And it will most certainly never be over. We are going to be living with COVID for the rest of our lives and we always must approach it, and other viral diseases, with caution.",

        "body": "Elizabeth Smith, a stay-at-home mom of six in southern Vermont, recently re-enrolled in school when the Community College of Vermont made an offer she couldn't refuse: $3,500 a semester deposited in her bank account, no strings attached.\u201cI think I was in a little bit of disbelief,\u201d Smith recalled recently.The money doesn\u2019t go too far after she accounts for textbooks, groceries and childcare \u2014 it's not enough to cover even the part-time childcare she needs for her own two-year-old \u2014 but it helps. The Community College of Vermont and other two-year schools from Maine to Florida are now shelling out money, sometimes in tandem with employers, to enroll students in training programs that prepare them for office jobs, as auto mechanics and in childcare. Community colleges in Massachusetts began partnering with Bank of America, Wayfair, Boston Scientific and other corporations in 2021 to pay students $15-an-hour for on-the-job customer service and administrative assistant certificate training. And in Maine, the community college system offers $500 weekly stipends and housing to students who enroll in training programs in welding and automotive repair. In Florida, Disney is paying some of its hourly employees to take courses, earn a degree, a high school diploma or learn a vocational skill at Orlando-based Valencia College.Low U.S. unemployment and a declining college enrollment landcape have fueled the trend, although it has some higher ed analysts questioning whether paying students after they complete a degree might be a better strategy.\u201cColleges are desperate,\u201d said Brandon Busteed, chief partnership officer at Kaplan, a corporation that provides higher education training and services. \u201cOur population in the U.S. is not growing and we just don't have enough young people in the pipeline to backfill that.\u201dBetween now and 2030, 75 million baby boomers are set to retire from their jobs. Over the same period, the population of traditional college-aged students will drop by 15%, leaving employers scrambling to fill the gap in trained workers. Hospitals like Southern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington, Vermont and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, as well as companies like Wayfair and Bath Iron Works in Maine, are helping foot the bill to create new worker pipelines. And Vermont offers a prime example of the problem: according to a recent analysis, the state needs more than 2,000 additional childcare workers in order to meet demand. That's a 78% increase in the total number of early childhood educators over current levels.Only 18 students have taken advantage of the Vermont program so far. But James Trimarchi, director of planning for Southwestern Vermont Health Care, said he expects that number to grow as word gets out.The hospital wanted to expand its nursing staff during the pandemic, and to do that, it had to hire more early childhood educators at the center.\u201cIf you're going to attract nurses, nurses often have families and they'll go to a place where their families can be safe while they're at work,\u201d he said.Instead, too many students are currently stuck slowly moving through community colleges, taking one or two courses a semester, often while working. If \"we could pay those students to focus on their academics, they could get their degree, move into the labor force more quickly,\" he said.The hospital, which treats patients from Vermont, New York and Massachusetts, gave a chunk of its federal COVID-19 relief funds to the Community College of Vermont to pay students. Some analysts, like Kaplan's Busteed, have criticized the program as flawed for not awarding the money to students more wisely, like when they graduate. \u201cThe better incentive is to pay for completing or to pay when they're hired in a job, where you're ultimately tracking the outcome,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there's no expectation that I don't complete, why wouldn't I just ghost that enrollment?\u201dThe Community College of Vermont said it is paying only students who live in Vermont, have worked in their chosen field and have maximized their financial aid to prevent ghosting. But the reality is that only about 30% of community college students attain a credential within four years, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Often the reason students don't obtain a degree is related to the cost of college or a fear of accumulating too much debt.Nancy Noel, director of Learning Tree, the early education center at the hospital in Bennington, said childcare isn't a high-paying career that allows students to pay off college loans quickly.\u201cIf we can help pay them along the way and they can get done earlier with less loans, hopefully they're going to enter the workforce at a full-time rate versus a substitute rate, which is really what we need to have,\u201d Noel said.While tens of millions of Americans are hoping for relief through President Joe Biden\u2019s $400 billion college loan debt forgiveness plan pending before the Supreme Court, some said that money would be better spent expanding programs like the one in Vermont if they help students not just attend, but graduate.Shalin Jyotishi, senior program manager at the Burning Glass Institute, said Biden's debt forgiveness plan doesn't fix the college affordability problem in a long-term way.\u201cWe're going to add a Band-Aid that will quickly peel off as more and more learners get loans and do not get jobs that sustain a local, living wage,\u201d Jyotishi said.Jyotishi thinks colleges should provide more incentives, like cash, for students to graduate on time. He cited a collaboration betweeen Mesa Community College in Arizona and Boeing that reimburses students after they complete their $250 manufacturing training. In Massachusetts, once participants in the on-the-job training program are hired into positions, they are paid the company's full-time rate with benefits, which is typically about $20 per hour.For now, the $3,500 financial enticement in Vermont appears to be working.Amy Bishop, a preschool teacher who never thought she'd be able to afford a college degree, signed on. A degree will give her a helpful pay bump.\u201cI\u2019ve just been doing this for so long, I just figured that I might as well have a degree in my life,\u201d she said.And if she keeps up, she will find another $3,500 in her bank account next semester.",

        "body": "Since 1973, the Charlton-based Nature's Classroom Inc. has operated nationwide educational programs for elementary and middle schoolers, featuring a variety of overnight and daylong field trips at its outdoor facilities. Among the hundreds of programs available for teachers to choose from, one in particular has been the subject of intense scrutiny: The Underground Railroad Simulation. Over the years, many former students have come forward to share traumatic experiences endured during the program, which featured simulations of slave ships, slave auctions and bounty hunts with adults performing in character as slave masters. While the program was ended at the Charlton location in 2014, concerned parents have spoken out about the Underground Railroad Simulation being offered at other Nature's Classroom locations across the country. Irene Rotondo, a reporter with MassLive who's been covering the story, spoke with GBH's All Things Considered host Arun Rath. What follows is a lightly edited transcript. Arun Rath: So, before we get into talking about the Underground Railroad Simulation, tell us a bit more about Nature's Classroom. Who exactly are they and what do they do? Irene Rotondo: Nature's Classroom is an organization that started in 1973. It began as a nonprofit host site for other programs, such as the YMCA or similar organizations. It developed into a for-profit environmental educational site, and they do currently serve third through eighth grade. The thing about Nature's Classroom is, when the founder started it, they gave their blessing to use its curriculum \u2014 its hundreds of programs \u2014 in any state that wishes to have environmental education. So with that, there's no telling how many teachers' classrooms there are across the country \u2014 or how many programs \u2014 use Nature's Classroom curriculum and go by a different name. It's very difficult to tell. Rath: It has what seems like laudable aims, and what I guess would be a laudable aim with the Underground Railroad Simulation is that to give young people an idea of what slavery was like. But even just laying this out: you have a situation where these actors, or instructors, will play the role of slave masters, and the kids will play the role of slaves. It sounds like not a great idea, but tell us about what that actually played out for these kids, who describe this as traumatic. Rotondo: Before I get into that, I do want to just stress: Nature's Classroom is not a historical education site. Its original intent and intent to this day, as I was told by its director, is environmental education. The Underground Railroad program is one of its few historical programs. The people I spoke with who experienced it told me it was really haunting, horrifying and scary and just frightening for them to experience as young children. I spoke with two women, one was 25 years old and one was 22. They both experienced it around the same time, 2009 or 2010-ish. So they told me that during the program they were first led into a large cabin at night. It was part of an evening activity they had been told they'd be participating in. The children were all led into a large cabin that was only lit by candles and lanterns, they had said, to simulate them being inside a \"slave ship.\" Once inside the \"slave ship,\" the children were told they were being taken to America. The children were laying on the floor, and as the children laid on the floor, they heard chains being slammed on the ground. Chains were being swung around the room, and the adults were yelling at the children, as transatlantic slave traders would. Through my reporting, I also saw a lot of TikToks about this and a lot of videos online. There's a lot of different accounts of what happened. It varied according to the Nature's Classroom institute the child went to. Not all the programs had the same intensity, but for the ones that did have the severe intensity, it really stuck with them. Other people recall a racial slur being used during this time, directed at the children by the instructors. After the children had \"arrived in America\" on the \"slave ship,\" they were led outside to be auctioned into smaller groups, basically to be broken up, to be led through the forest on the Underground Railroad expedition, which was the whole point of the activity, was to walk through the forest at night, guided by the counselors, and to learn about the history. What the former students told me happened is they were screamed at. Some remember dogs barking and dogs present on the premise. I was told in my interviews with the Nature's Classroom associate director that dogs weren't allowed on the premise at this time, there was no way they were dogs. But I will say, during my visit, there were dog tracks that I had seen on the premise. So people, the children, remember the dogs barking as they're being led through the woods. They remember other counselors pretending to be bounty hunters and slave owners popping out of the shadows, yelling at them. After that, they told me the activity ends in another cabin and they'd essentially arrived in Canada. They'd escaped the plantation, they'd escaped on the Underground Railroad, and they were now safe in Canada. But they had to then hide in different parts of that building from bounty hunters.That's pretty much where the activity ended. The whole goal of it, again, was just to teach the children about the Underground Railroad. The intensity that it was brought really, really stuck with a lot of people. And it changed a lot of their perspectives, too, especially for the Black children who had to experience this. I believe the perspectives were different. Race was another important part of this. Rath: Now, that was something that was flooring in reading your report was that a good number of these kids who were being treated as slaves in the psychodrama were people of color, Black kids themselves.Rotondo: Yeah, that was something that was really painful for for me to report on when I did hear the story, because it's hard to imagine having one Black child in the room full of white children and having to go through the experience and being told these things and being told to act as a slave, as a Black child. That was tough. Rath: What's the status of the Underground Railroad Simulation now? It's no longer being done in Massachusetts, right? Rotondo: I can say it is not being done at the Charlton location in Massachusetts. However, for the rest of the country, I cannot say the same. I know in 2018 there were more allegations that were brought up. And then, through my own reporting, I found listed on a Catholic organization \u2014 the Trinity Center's Sound to Sea Environmental Program, offered in North Carolina. They offer an education programs to children and to schools, to groups, listed on its site, that they used a lot of as classroom curricula. And it also says that the Underground Railroad program is being offered for the 2022-2023 year of service. So I know for sure it's being there. They didn't respond when I reached out to comment. I have also seen it listed on an FFA site in Ohio that also uses Nature's Classroom programing. I have seen it listed on an Alabama Nature's Classroom website. I have at least found for sure at least one, if not three to four, still presently \u2014 and that's just the ones that I know of. Rath: Wow. There is no clean ending to this story.Rotondo: No, unfortunately, no.",

        "body": "The past few days have been a whirlwind for Holy Cross women\u2019s basketball. They beat their rivals down the turnpike, Boston University, 66-61 on Sunday to bring the Patriot League conference title to Worcester. That earned the Crusaders a bid in the NCAA Tournament, where on Friday they\u2019ll face off against Maryland, the No. 2 seed in their region of the bracket. And they are the only Division I program in Massachusetts to make it to the tournament this year.Junior forward Janelle Allen said it all doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s true yet. \u201cSo, I feel like once we start, you know, getting on the bus and loading up our stuff, it\u2019s gonna hit us like, \u2018Wow, we\u2019re actually here,\u2019\u201d Allen said before practice on Wednesday. Over the course of just a few days, the Crusaders have had to balance the elation of earning the program\u2019s 13th-ever invite to the Big Dance with the daunting task of being a Cinderella facing off against one of the best teams in the country. But for head coach Maureen Magarity\u2019s squad, there\u2019s joy in just getting this far. And a quiet confidence that they can maybe bust a few brackets. Magarity is no stranger to what this moment means for a player: In 2000, she was a first-year student at Boston College when the Eagles advanced to the second round of the NCAA Tournament. And in 2004, she was a senior on the Marist squad that made the program\u2019s first-ever trip to the NCAA Tournament. They lost in the first-round to Oklahoma, but the memory still shines bright for Magarity. \u201cAnd to be able to go to the Big Dance with your best friends is still one of my most cherished moments of my entire life, besides the birth of my children to be honest, you know?\u201d she said with a chuckle. \u201cAnd we were the first team in school history to bring Marist to the NCAAs and there was five of us seniors. So, I just kind of explained to the players about how great it is to do it with people that you love and your best friends.\u201dIt's a sentiment that her players already understand. Addisyn Cross is the only senior for Holy Cross this season. Her freshman year, the Crusaders\u2019 season was cut short when the Patriot League canceled its tournament amid the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, that journey is getting a storybook ending. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have asked for a better way to finish out my senior year,\u201d Cross said. \u201cI\u2019m gonna look back on these memories for forever. I mean, last Sunday was probably the best day of my life. So, this is just an incredible experience, and I\u2019m so glad I get to experience it with my team.\u201dOn Friday, the March Madness dream will become a reality when Holy Cross faces off against Maryland on the Terrapins\u2019 home court. It will be just the third time the two programs have met, with the first being Holy Cross\u2019 only win in prior NCAA Tournaments, all the way back in 1991. This time, they\u2019ll meet a program led by head coach Brenda Frese that won a national title in 2006 and that\u2019s picked up multiple wins against Top 10 teams this season. If there\u2019s any chance for Holy Cross to notch its second NCAA Tournament win in program history, players like Bronagh Power-Cassidy \u2014 who scored 21 points against BU in the conference title game and was named the championship MVP \u2014 will have to play some of their best basketball. To that end, the junior guard is looking to funnel the emotions of an exciting week into the game. \u201cOne of the things we continuously told ourselves across the entire Patriot League tournament was just be present in that moment and focus on each possession, each play. Every minute we\u2019re out there, we\u2019re fighting,\u201d Power-Cassidy said. \u201cSo I think just riding this high and we\u2019re on this roll right now, so I think if we just continue that and use the emotions from the past couple of weeks to just kind of push us on and continue to focus on each moment and to keep fighting, I think that\u2019s just the best way we\u2019re gonna head into this.\u201dMagarity knows that Maryland will be a huge challenge for the Crusaders. At practice Wednesday, she pointed out the Terrapins\u2019 size, athleticism and pressure on the ball. But she also acknowledged her team\u2019s strengths, like the Crusaders\u2019 stingy defense, which has given up just 54.8 points per game this season. And while most people probably have Maryland locked in to win, the magic of March Madness is that anything can happen.\u201cWe know it\u2019s gonna be a tough test and we have all the respect in the world for Maryland, but why not?\u201d Magarity said. \u201cLet\u2019s just see what happens and have fun with it and I\u2019m really excited to see how the team performs.\u201d",

        "body": "More tenants are taking their concerns over disputes with landlords to the state than ever before, according to a new consumer report from the state attorney general\u2019s office.The attorney general\u2019s office received more landlord-tenant related complaints than previously recorded, a recent 2022 Consumer Advocacy report published by Attorney General Andrea Campbell\u2019s office cited. \u201cThis report reaffirms what we already know \u2014 that we are in a housing crisis in Massachusetts,\u201d said Campbell in a statement to GBH News, adding that her office is there to help. \u201cMy office is committed to creating economic security for residents across Massachusetts by standing up for tenants who are being treated unfairly by landlords, enforcing our housing laws and ensuring that all our residents have access to safe, sanitary and affordable housing.\u201d For the first time, housing complaints surpassed those against used car dealers. The office received 918 consumer complaints about rental housing in 2022, and 171 requests for help through their eviction help request form. Many of those complaints involved unsafe or unsanitary conditions in rental units. Each were reviewed by the Attorney General\u2019s Consumer Advocacy and Response Division, with eviction cases \u201cprioritized\u201d in 2022. They respond by connecting renters with legal services and rental assistance programs, where applicable. The office doesn\u2019t typically get \u201cdollar recoveries\u201d for most landlord-tenant cases, except for some returned security deposits and late fees. For those specific cases, the Consumer Advocacy and Response Division recovered more than $108,000 for 63 people in 2022. \u201cThe consumers we work with on eviction and conditions complaints are often in serious financial distress and success on these complaints is often measured by connecting them with resources,\u201d the office said in a statement. In one case, a tenant filed a complaint with the AG\u2019s office over a severe pest problem their landlord had been notified about several times. When the landlord didn\u2019t fix the issue, they broke their lease and moved out, but the landlord didn\u2019t return their $2,400 security deposit. The AG\u2019s Local Consumer Program contacted the landlord and got the tenant their full deposit back. \u201cIf your landlord is violating the statute as it pertains to security deposit or whether or not they're like holding on to that money, they don't put it into a separate interest accruing account \u2014 if you don't get it back within 30 days \u2014 you're actually entitled to treble damages,\" said Mark Martinez, housing staff attorney at Massachusetts Law Reform Institute. He wasn\u2019t surprised to see the growing number of complaints about living conditions.\u201cI think as people are being expected to pay more and more for housing, without the quality of that housing increasing as well, I think people are less and less willing to accept the fact that they're living in unsafe or unsanitary apartments,\u201d Martinez said. The report also outlined upcoming changes to the state sanitary code, including a rule that landlords must inspect for pests before new tenants move in and document that, and that landlords must make a good-faith effort to correct dangerous and unsafe living conditions within 24 hours.Martinez said restitution for poor conditions or repairs, are the types of issues that involve long housing court processes, and are not typically part of the role of an attorney general\u2019s office. That\u2019s where legal aid organizations like his own fill a need. \u201cAs that [complaints] increases, I don't think the answer is necessarily the AG continuing to take on a bigger role in housing rather than supporting policies outside of the AG's office that would respond to these issues as well,\u201d said Martinez. Overall in 2022, the AG\u2019s office fielded over 23,000 consumer complaints, which included consumers reaching out about student loan providers, over 900 related to used car sales, and over 630 had issues involving solar power \u2014 like delays in connecting rooftop panels, and underperforming solar systems.",

        "body": "Over the past few years, more than 250 Starbucks cafes across the country have unionized through grassroots efforts. That's despite significant pushback from the company's corporate leadership, which has faced lawsuits for alleged union-busting practices and accusations that it's fired workers for attempting to organize their stores. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is scheduled to testify in a U.S. Senate hearing about the company's labor practices later this month. In Massachusetts, 14 Starbucks locations have voted to unionize, and many have faced similar tension with the company's leadership. Last week, a Starbucks in Boston's Cleveland Circle was abruptly shuttered until late summer for what the company says are plumbing issues. Employees of the store argue that the move demonstrates the company's disregard for their job security, and they're speaking out against what they see as an effort to crush their union. Willow Montana, a shift manager at the Cleveland Circle Starbucks who has led the cafe's unionization efforts, spoke with GBH All Things Considered host Arun Rath. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.Arun Rath: So first off, I have to imagine that the Cleveland Circle Starbucks is a fairly busy location. Willow Montana: Yeah, it definitely is. A lot of our business comes from nearby students as well as just people who live in the community and who've have been there for decades and who've known us for just as long. Rath: So, the closing is impactful. Tell us what happened and what Starbucks leadership told you about their reasons for closing the store. Montana: So, our store is in a unique situation where we were set to have renovations done starting August of last year, 2022, and they pushed the date on those renovations many times. During that period of them pushing the date, we had begun having a problem with our pipes where the excessive flushing of the toilets will cause them to back up with dirty water into the floor drains and onto the floor, which forces us to close for several days at a time while the health inspector comes to approve it and to make sure it's OK after it gets cleaned. This is a problem that we've had before \u2014 and Starbucks has been aware of it, but hasn't really done anything to permanently fix the problem. Last Tuesday, we were having a problem where the drains had started backing up, and so they closed us temporarily for just a couple of days to get the store cleaned up. Two days later, our district manager called us to tell us that they're actually going to keep it shut down for the renovations that have been pushed back so many times so that they can fix the pipes permanently and then start the renovations. They had told us those renovations would take three months when they did eventually happen. Because of the problem with the pipes, they're now saying it's going to be more like a five-month closure period, which is very unfortunate because that's a long time. Rath: What does that mean then for employees? Do you get transferred to work at another store or you just don't work while the store is closed? Montana: Back in August of last year, because we have a union, we were able to go into what's called \"effects bargaining\" with the company. We were able to negotiate a contract for what will happen to us during the time period of the renovations. Because that bargaining took place so long ago, a lot of the language that's in there \u2014 for example, what partner wants to go to which store for however many hours a week, whatever it is \u2014 needs to be altered, because there's been significant turnover between August of last year and this March. So there's just certain things that need to be adjusted in that contract before it can really be put into place. We're currently in the process of going back and forth with our union attorney and the Starbucks attorneys about making that contract work for all of us. I actually, right before this interview, got out of a meeting about some of the changes that Starbucks has proposed that we are now pushing back on. It's just a constant push from each direction about \"We want this\" and \"They don't want that.\" We're in that process of negotiating again right now. But in the meantime, it was kind of complicated, because at first what the district manager called to offer all of the partners is the ability to pick up shifts through what they call \"shift marketplace.\" It's something that exists in the scheduling app that they use where if a partner doesn't want to work a shift, they can relinquish it and then somebody else can pick it up. That was the option that they gave us, which does not work in any way whatsoever because there simply won't be enough given-away shifts for a 20-person staff who works mostly full-time. The other option is that they said that our manager would be in touch with us to give us shifts at other locations all around the district in the area. And this worked for a few days. What they then did as a slightly more permanent option, but it's not really permanent, is for this current week that started on March 6, they let us all choose a location which was again, kind of limited. They only gave us a couple stores to choose from, and then they applied our schedule for what had been scheduled at our store, Cleveland Circle, for this week to the location of our choosing. It's an OK option, but our district manager has been very clear that that is only for this week until the negotiations are sorted out, which will likely take more than just this week, if I'm being honest, given what I've read from Starbucks. Hopefully the same \"deal\" will be applied every single week until we figure out the contract. But for right now, we're in this state of constant flux and it feels like we're a little bit in limbo, where nobody really knows where they work, if they work anywhere. It's been tough. It's really strange. We keep joking that we are \"store homeless\" because we don't really have a home store anymore. Rath: So, the backdrop for all of this \u2014 or the front, because it is front and center \u2014 is this relationship with burgeoning unionization and tension with Starbucks management. You mentioned that there are legitimate reasons for the closure, such as renovations, but the sense is that maybe the closure is being used as a negotiation tactic. Is that your sense? How much of this is having to do with a union versus how much is having to do with what needs to happen at the store? Montana: Oh, that's an excellent question. I think all of it has to do with the fact that we have a union and this is in a lot of ways a form of retaliation against us, the way that they're handling it. You know, it's interesting because I had just gotten off call where we were talking about the original contract we had bargained for in July or August of last year. It felt almost too easy, the things that they gave us, almost like they knew that contract was never going to be put in play. Now we're renegotiating for a lot of the things that are in it, and they're giving us a much harder time. It feels intentional. For example, they don't really want to give anyone their first choice of store to work at, which is incredibly difficult because we have all chosen these stores for a reason, whether it be proximity to them or how easily we're able to get there by public transit. It seems like they have unilaterally chosen stores for us instead, which was not the original agreement. The original agreement was we came to them with choices and they said whether or not those choices could work and at the time they did work. So it seems like what they're trying to do is force people to quit because the quality of this job has drastically gone down from what it was when we were all working together in the same store. It's like they want to make our jobs and our lives harder intentionally during this five month period to break up the strong union that we have at our store. And we are a strong store. I want to say that we are one of the strongest in the Boston area, and I think that they know that. I think much is to be seen and said about what we finally land on in contract negotiations, as well as how long it takes. But we're not going to roll over easy without a fight. That's why we have the unions, why we have the ability to go into contract negotiations \u2014 to get an agreement that works for us. So that's what we intend to do. Starbucks did not respond to a request for comment.",

        "body": "Updated at 11:57 a.m. March 10SeparatorThe MBTA announced Thursday night it was immediately slowing trains across the entire system because of safety concerns. As of Friday morning, most of those restrictions are no longer in place.Speed limits remain in effect on Green Lines and the Mattapan Trolley, with trains not exceeding 10-25 miles an hour, depending on the location. Normally speeds vary by line but top out at 40 mph.Agency officials explained that the decision was made following recent track testing and a site visit by the Department of Public Utilities. The agency uses an ultrasonic system to detect track defects that may not be visible to the naked eye \u2014 from spacing between the rails being too tight to a slight twist in the rails \u2014 and testing from that system showed inconsistencies they needed to follow up on.\"This decision that we made yesterday to slow the trains down globally was done out of an abundance of caution for their safety. And that is something right now that we have to remain completely committed to,\" interim MBTA General Manager Jeff Gonneville said at a press conference Friday.Gonneville said he expects inspections to take a couple days. He could not predict when the remaining restrictions would be lifted, because that depends on whether inspectors identify areas of track that need repair.\"Frankly, this is all part of ensuring that the T is safe,\" he said. \"Safe for our customers, safe for our employees.\"The MBTA has been running trains with speed restrictions over some parts of the system because of track work and safety concerns over months, notably on sections of the Orange Line after they reopened following a 30-day shutdown in August and September. The agency announced other disruptions Friday morning: Shuttle buses replaced the Mattapan trolley along the entirety of its route, from Mattapan Square to Ashmont, until just after 8 a.m. Friday; and a power outage meant Blue Line trains were replaced with shuttle buses between Maverick and Suffolk Downs. On Thursday, the MBTA\u2019s chief safety officer, Ronald Ester Jr., told the MBTA\u2019s board that the Department of Public Utilities, which oversees the MBTA, found a few pressing issues. \u201cThe DPU identified several issues that resulted in some immediate action letters being issued to the MBTA,\u201d Ester said. \u201cThey were: Priority 1one track conditions, third rail insulators, electrical access boxes on the right of way, headlight operation within the tunnels, PPE compliance and safety briefings.\u201d Commuters Friday mornings responded to the slowdowns with a mixture of frustration and resignation.\u201cI would love to see the T function better because I think it\u2019s important to have a system like this.

It\u2019s too soon to tell what the weather will be like on any particular day or week down the line this spring, but meteorologists can forecast some larger trends. \u201cThat said, if you look at the long range 90-day forecast, which covers March, April and May, it overall looks warmer than average,\u201d Epstein said. \u201cNo surprise, the climate is warming up.\u201dLast summer\u2019s drought does not look like it will be returning to the region, at least not in the spring, he said. \u201cI'm pretty confident that we're not going to have the low amount of rain that we saw last year in spring and into the summer because the pattern has changed,\u201d Epstein said. \u201cWe're out of the La Ni\u00f1a, now we're headed to an El Ni\u00f1o, actually. So I do think it's going to be wetter.\u201dThat doesn\u2019t mean non-stop rain is certain, he said \u2014 just that drought is less likely. Make sure your plants have enough light, Epstein said. \u201cYou really want to have absolute bare minimum of four hours,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could get away if it was like 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., but you want as much sunshine as possible.\u201dAlso key: high-quality soil, he said. \u201cThe soil is the life of all these vegetables,\u201d Epstein said. \u201cIf you're doing a container garden, you want to get container gardening soil for vegetables. It's organic. It doesn't have a lot of chemicals in it. If you're in the ground, I would say you want to add compost, which doesn't have to be expensive. You want to be sure that it's well-drained. And again, lots of sunshine.\u201dSome crop recommendations: Radishes are easy and satisfying, Epstein said. Lettuces, Asian greens like bok choi, and kale are also relatively easy, he said. \u201cPut a pot of tomatoes out,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if you don't have an in-ground garden, just a container with tomatoes. It can be a bucket, one of those big buckets that you get at one of the big box stores \u2014 as long as there's drainage.\u201dEpstein said raspberries grown next to a deck should be fine, but advised against planting crops inside a container made of pressure-treated wood. \u201cI wouldn't necessarily worry about that, that the deck is that close,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn't create a raised bed out of pressure treated wood because there is some thought that some of the chemicals may leach in. But I wouldn't worry about that with the raspberries.\u201d\u201cOne of the things that is great about the city is that there is a lot of outdoor space,\u201d Epstein said. \u201cI think just going down to the Boston Common and just walking around Boston seeing all those spring flowers is certainly easy to do.\u201dEpstein\u2019s other favorites include: the Massachusetts Horticultural Society\u2019s Garden at Elm Bank , which opens April 1; Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, which has some beautiful flowering trees; the Arnold Arboretum in Jamaica Plain, and the New England Botanic Garden at Tower Hill in Boylston.",

        "body": "With Women's History Month underway, GBH\u2019s Morning Edition is highlighting how women are excelling in fields that are traditionally dominated by men, like science, technology, engineering and math. There are still significant barriers to entry in those fields, including an exposure gap. One person looking to break those barriers is Marcia Bartusiak, an author, journalist and professor of the practice emeritus at MIT, who's been covering the fields of astronomy and physics for four decades. She joined Morning Edition co-hosts Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel for a discussion. This transcript has been lightly edited. Jeremy Siegel: It's a pleasure to have you. So you're kind of a legend in the field. You were among the first to report on discoveries like dark matter and meteorites from Mars. You have a long and storied career reporting on science and writing about science. Tell us a bit about your trajectory, like how you ended up in the space in the first place. Marcia Bartusiak: I have a very unusual background. I started out actually in journalism. I myself was inspired while I was in high school by the first female reporter at a local TV station in the Norfolk, Virginia Beach area. And I was determined \u2014 \"Oh, I like that, I'll go into that.\" So I went to school, got a degree in journalism, went back to Norfolk and became her rival reporter at another station. But the NASA Langley Research Center was nearby. And when I did stories there, I was in love with covering science. And I said, \"If I could do this 24/7, I would be in heaven.\" So I actually went back to school to pump up my science background and ended up with a master's degree in physics, and then went on to combine those two fields to write on the field of science. Paris Alston: It's fascinating because science is sometimes something very complicated to communicate. Even like Jeremy and I, we do science stories here. We do our absolute best. I think sometimes we knock it out and then sometimes it knocks us out. How are you able to transfer and merge those two worlds to make something that's been digestible for everyday people? Bartusiak: Well, I like to quote The New York Times reporter George Johnson: \"to take the strange and make it familiar.\" And that's my passion: to get people excited about something. They think, \"Oh, my gosh, I couldn't possibly understand that.\" But that's the role of a science writer, is to take those, what seemed to be difficult ideas and, through metaphors and analogies, show how it affects your everyday life, or explain them with examples that they would be familiar with from their everyday life. And women can bring a perspective on this. I was thinking of one story I did \u2014 I was talking to some theoretical physicists about: What is the nature of space-time? And on the tiniest of levels, they had a theory that it was made up of these little loops of energy. And a male reporter who reported on this as well described it as a medieval soldier's chainmail. I preferred thinking of it as weaving a blanket of space-time. So a woman can bring a different perspective, different analogies. That's what we can add to these different viewpoints. Alston: Next time we talk about space, we've got to remember blankets. Siegel: Yeah, we'll bring our blankets. So as we're thinking about some of the lingering gender disparities in science fields, I've told Paris a number of times that I was a failed science major in college \u2014 started out as a chemistry major, and ended up switching to something different. But looking back at my time in college, which wasn't too long ago: especially in math and engineering classes, it was mostly men. And so even though we've made a lot of progress, there are still significant, lingering barriers for young women and girls entering STEM fields. As a science writer who is making these things more accessible to people who they might not be accessible to, how can we do a better job of talking about and writing about science? Bartusiak: Great strides have been made in the biological sciences. Women are now pretty much in parity with the men in terms of numbers. It's the physical sciences: engineering, mathematics. And for me, because it helped me to be inspired by a role model, I think the same can be true in science. More women science teachers to serve as mentors; of course, more women scientists; but also I think communicators like me and others can play a role. I think it's important for young girls, young women, to see a woman's byline in the newspaper or on the cover of a book, to hear a woman's voice on the radio. To see a woman's face on TV. And I have to give a shout out to those women scientists who are using social media, the great means of communications for the current generation on TikTok, on YouTube, to do these wonderful little short programs explaining various aspects of science. I think that can be very important. So it's also breaking down those stereotypes, that somehow if you're going to major in a hard science that, \"Oh, I'm not going to get that boyfriend.\" But I think seeing these role models around them more and more, and seeing more women in science communication. And women are now the major science communicators! That wasn't the case when I entered the field in the 1980s. Men were the dominant science communicators. Now it's women. And I think that may be, not of a large part, but playing a role in attracting more young girls and young women. Alston: So in the 30 seconds we have left here, Marcia, I mean, what are some of the challenges that women face once they get into those fields? And how can the fields adjust to be more welcoming to them? Bartusiak: I think they have to know that sometimes women will have different reactions than a man in terms of how they're absorbing the material. And I think that all of the science instructors, male or female, have to understand that. Some women may not be as aggressive. I think I was fortunate in that I went back to school after having worked in the real world, so that I wasn't afraid of confronting a professor or asking a question in class. And I think those skill sets need to be addressed, perhaps even at a high-school level, that women know they can have a voice.",

That could mean more frequent and damaging heat waves, drought, wildfires and tropical storms, as well as worsening health conditions and shrinking access to food, water and housing.Boston is not immune to these issues, especially due to the city's proximity to the ocean. The Rev. Mariama White-Hammond, Boston's chief of environment energy and open space, and Patrick Kinney, professor of environmental health at Boston University School of Public Health, said on Greater Boston there's great urgency to deal with climate change. They said environmental impacts such as extreme heat waves in the summer have major effects on children, the elderly and those with chronic health conditions.\"During our lifetimes it's going to get worse, but it's going to be especially challenging for our children and their children, so what we do now will really have a huge impact on their lives,\" Kinney said.White-Hammond said Boston is very vulnerable to climate change. She said she and her team have mapped flood pathways to work on closing those, and use city land to rise seawalls.\"We need a full economy transformation and we needed it yesterday, but we've got to drive to it today with urgency,\" White-Hammond said, noting an economy driven by fossil fuels.On an individual level, Kinney recommended using electric home heating, driving an electric vehicle or taking public transportation. He said Boston should continue its work to convert public transportation to run on electricity.White-Hammond said there are programs in Boston that can help residents convert their homes to 100% green energy, which in some circumstances can even be a cheaper option. Those programs can be found online or by calling 311. Watch: UN climate scientists warn of irreversible damage if we don't act fast. Here's what you can do",

        "body": "Advocates for a stronger rent control policy dominated the Boston City Council\u2019s second public hearing on the issue Thursday, ratcheting up pressure to alter the controversial plan put forward last month by Mayor Michelle Wu.Wu has repeatedly defended her proposal as balanced. It would cap annual rent increases at a maximum of 10% in high inflation years, and the rate of inflation plus 6% in most other years. Her rent control plan would also exempt recently constructed buildings for 15 years, as well as landlords who own six units or fewer and live on-site with their tenants. Thursday\u2019s commenters insisted the mayor's proposal be tightened to counter a rising tide of unaffordability by shortening the building exemption period and lowering the annual rent increase cap to a maximum of 5%.\u201cWe\u2019re asking for just rents,\u201d East Boston resident Maribel Castro said through an interpreter. Castro said she is currently trying to cope with a rent increase brought on by a new landlord seeking $3,000 a month for a two-bedroom apartment.\u201cAnd that\u2019s not fair. \u2026 We\u2019re asking Michelle Wu, the mayor, to do something about it [and] also all of you,\u201d she said to the sitting councilors.James Cordero, a public school teacher and Dorchester resident, asked the council to \u201crefine\u201d the rent control policy to ensure more renters are protected. \u201cThat means this 10% cap really should be reduced to a 5% cap including inflation \u2026 and we really need to make sure that this policy applies to as many properties as possible, including those properties that are new construction,\u201d Cordero said. Natalie Bell, a Dorchester homeowner, testified that her ability to purchase a home was \u201conly made possible\u201d through her partner\u2019s access to generational wealth. \u201cOur housing cost \u2026 is about one half of the market rate I see for comparable rental units,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy is 6% plus inflation even being called 'rent control' at all? It sounds kind of like profit allowance,\" Bell said. \"I want to close by asking if you can imagine legislating that the wage of every renter in the city would also go up 6% plus inflation, because if we can\u2019t picture that happening, then we should grapple with what is happening, which is that we\u2019re privileging an investor class at the expense of everyone else.\u201d Until now, the criticism of Wu's rent control plan came principally from organized interests such as the Greater Boston Real Estate Board, which launched a $400,000 public campaign against the policy, and MassLandlords, which recently filed a lawsuit seeking documents related to how Wu chose the members of her rent control advisory committee.The hearing came after repeated rallies across the state in support of a lower cap on annual rent increases. In January, advocates gathered in front of the State House, insisting that a 5% maximum would keep rental rates stable and be more in line with stagnant wages. Last week, at the City Council\u2019s first hearing on Wu\u2019s proposed policy, councilors began signaling ways they might attempt to change the plan. At Thursday's public hearing, several councilors applauded Wu\u2019s effort to initiate public discussion on a wedge issue and indicated a desire to amend her proposal.\u201cThis is a historic moment, yes,\u201d said Councilor Kendra Lara, who has publicly stated she wants the rental cap lowered. \u201cAnd I want to commend Mayor Wu for being able to take the step to take the step to even put this on the floor in front of us \u2014 but what good is a historic moment if we\u2019re going to squander it?\u201d \u201cOne question I\u2019m just wondering about [is] how we ended up at CPI plus 6%,\u201d said Councilor Liz Breadon.Breadon added: \u201cI really applaud Mayor Wu \u2026 but, I feel that we need to really scrutinize the numbers a bit more to see if we can improve the situation.\u201dCouncilor Ricardo Arroyo cited census data that shows Boston has already lost thousands of Black residents in the past couple decades. \u201cI have no doubt that that has to do with the cost of living. ... So I think this is an incredibly important step to do this for rent stabilization,\u201d he said, \u201cand I recognize that for people who have already been displaced, this comes too late.\u201dCouncilor Brian Worrell echoed concerns expressed by small landlords including a need for increased rental assistance and the need for housing production \u201con top of\u201d a rent control policy.Councilor Kenzie Bok echoed Wu's assertion that the proposal on the table balances the interests of renters and housing creators.Councilors are scheduled to hold a technical session to begin proposing adjustments to the policy next week.",

        "body": "Gov. Maura Healey used her speech to the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce Thursday to pitch the various components of her tax relief package and $55.5 billion budget as a down payment on the state\u2019s future, saying she sees a \u201cbig need\u201d to improve the quality of life for Massachusetts families. Healey told the crowd of nearly 800 people gathered at the Westin Copley Place that the conversation around quality of life starts with affordability. She said her budget and tax plan propose ways to lower costs, improve schools, train workers and grow the state\u2019s economy, and that those measures are central to keeping Massachusetts competitive with other states. \u201cWe need to make Massachusetts more affordable if we want to attract and retain talent, and we need to connect workers with job opportunities and create that pipeline, and we need to do it yesterday,\u201d Healey said. As one pathway into the workforce, Healey highlighted a $20 million plan in her budget to make community college free for adults age 25 and up. Healey\u2019s budget would boost state spending 4% over this year. Along with it, she filed a $742 million package of tax reforms that features breaks for renters, seniors, and people caring for children under 13 and other dependentsTwo pieces of Healey\u2019s tax package \u2014 a lower tax rate for short-term capital gains and a higher threshold for the estate tax, so it would kick in for estates valued at $3 million instead of the current $1 million \u2014 earned praise from business groups like the Chamber, but sparked criticism from progressive circles.\"By spending hundreds of millions of dollars on permanent tax giveaways to the wealthy, the governor\u2019s budget proposal limits the state's ability to make even greater investments in public higher education today, and threatens the state\u2019s ability to fully fund public education from pre-K through college in future years,\" Vatsady Sivongxay, executive director of the Massachusetts Education Justice Alliance, said in her statement. In an interview later Thursday on GBH\u2019s Boston Public Radio, Healey defended her moves on the estate and short-term capital gains taxes as ways to bring Massachusetts\u2019 tax policy more in line with other states. \u201cOnly 12 states even have an estate tax, and at a million dollars, \u2026 we have the lowest cap in the country, along with the state of Oregon, so you know, I understand this is a subject of debate,\u201d Healey said. \u201cBut honestly, I am focused on affordability and I am focused on competitiveness and making sure that residents and families are able to grow and thrive here in the state. She said Massachusetts is an outlier as well on its capital gains tax, as one of only three states that tax short-term capital gains at a higher rate than gains on assets held for longer than a year. Healey covered several other topics during her radio appearance. In other budget matters, Healey said she\u2019s proposing the highest-ever level of funding for the Massachusetts Cultural Council, at $25 million, as well as the largest amount of funding for K-12 education. She voiced support for banning ghost guns, untraceable weapons that are assembled through parts often bought online or made with 3-D printers. \u201cWe need to do everything we can to get rid of them,\u201d Healey said, describing the emergence of ghost guns as a serious issue across the country. Responding to a question from a Barnstable High School student visiting the Boston Public Library on a field trip, Healey said her administration will work to bring younger people\u2019s voices to the table and that she \u201cmight even have a youth council of my own\u201d at some point. She said she\u2019ll back President Joe Biden if he seeks another term in the White House as expected.",

His story is detailed in the book \"Rough Sleepers,\" by journalist Tracy Kidder, who followed O'Connell for five years. O'Connell, speaking on Greater Boston, said he stumbled into his role by accident, and the job took off. Soon after starting his work at Pine Street Inn decades ago, he implemented a community outreach van to connect with the homeless population and provide food, support and medical advice.\"It was the best thing that happened to me and I still think of that as my spiritual home in all of this,\" O'Connell said. He still regularly goes out in the van.O'Connell said he's learned several lessons along the way while working with people experiencing homelessness. He stopped requiring appointments for his patients and went out to them instead. He also launched a respite program for people who need a safe place to recover after being discharged from the hospital.He had some words of advice for residents of Boston who encounter people on the street.\"When you see someone on the streets and they're asking for something... the most important thing is to not look away from them, just look them in the eye,\" O'Connell said.

        "body": "Households in Massachusetts that use federal SNAP benefits to help pay for food will see the amount they receive drop by an average of $150 after today. That's because a federal COVID-era enhancement of the program is coming to an end.\"It will impact the entire caseload, which is 640,000 households and over a million residents,\" said Brittany Mangini, associate commissioner for food security and nutrition programs at the state Department of Transitional Assistance.\"I think, unfortunately, it's going to really undermine a lot of the efforts that we have to mitigate food insecurity across the Commonwealth,\" Mangini said. \"But one thing that we've done, is try to be as proactive as possible with getting information out to folks so that we can address the impact that it's going to have on their overall household budget.\"The state set up a website detailing resources to help people reduce the impact of the loss in food assistance, Mangini said.Advocates for food security in Massachusetts say the sunsetting of the federal SNAP expansion is coming at a difficult moment, with food prices and other expenses especially high.\"We are worried because we're doing everything we can,\" said Catherine Lynn of the Greater Boston Food Bank. \"At a time when we're already seeing elevated need and demand on our system, and at a time when food, gas, energy, housing, medical... [and] childcare costs are through the roof, the cost of living is so expensive... every single income stream is going to be so important.\" Lynn said she expects the sudden drop in benefits to increase reliance on assistance from the Greater Boston Food Bank, which distributes food to 600 food pantries, meal programs, shelters and markets around the state.\"We know that this support has directly helped people put food on the table and to alleviate that worry about feeding themselves and feeding their kids,\" said Erin McAleer of Project Bread. \"The folks that are calling Project Bread are worried. We talked just earlier this week to a senior citizen from Fitchburg who says she'll now be receiving only 23 dollars a month.\"Governor Maura Healey's supplemental budget approved Wednesday by the state House of Representatives included $130 million to enhance SNAP benefits for the next three months. Lynn said that would be enough to cover 40 percent of the reduction during that period.\"What I proposed doing through that Senate budget was providing people a little bit more of a glide path so it wouldn't be so abrupt,\" Healey said Thursday on GBH's Greater Boston. \"So that people wouldn't go from, you know, overnight losing what's estimated to be an average of $150 a month.\"The state Senate is expected to consider the supplemental budget next week.\"Massachusetts has a real opportunity here to be a leader,\" Lynn said. \"I have high confidence that the legislature is going to pass this supplemental budget, and I think it will make a difference and a huge impact in terms of ... [reducing] that shock that people are going to feel. And so it won't be feeling like someone's pulling a rug underneath them.\" But the supplemental budget, Lynn pointed out, does not include any increased funding to cover increased reliance on food banks like hers. \"So we are talking to our legislators,\" she said. \"In a state of emergency, ensuring that the emergency food system is sustained with the right level of funding is going to be critical.\" This story includes reporting by Mary Blake.",

        "body": "Local disability organizations hosted a rally in Boston Wednesday to call for better wages and working conditions for personal care attendants, or PCAs, who support people with disabilities and help them live independently. Advocates say the state program faces a \u201ccrisis\u201d of staffing shortages. More than 100 PCAs and the people who rely on them made their way from the 32BJ SEIU union hall to The Embrace statue on the Boston Common, and then marched into the State House to deliver a letter with demands to Gov. Maura Healey\u2019s office. They are asking the governor to increase the hourly PCA wage to $25, improve benefits and retirement security, and provide better job training for career advancement.The MassHealth PCA program provides support to people with disabilities who live at home to help them stay out of nursing homes. PCAs, who are hired and managed by the disabled consumer, help with daily tasks like getting out of bed, showering, dressing and preparing food. There are more than 58,000 PCAs in the state \u2014 mostly women of color \u2014 but the workforce is not large enough to support everyone who needs them.PCAs currently make $17.80 an hour, which will go up to $18 on April 1. Advocates say further increasing pay will attract more people to the job by competing with rising wages in other industries.Because of the staffing shortage, some people can\u2019t find personal care attendants and are forced to rely on family and friends. Ellie Vargas said that without PCAs, her mother has had to fill in to care for her, even though she isn\u2019t a trained healthcare worker.\u201cMy mother is 65 years old. She can't do this anymore, you know? So it's not only having issues with housing, but I'm having PCA issues for the last three-plus years,\u201d she said.\u201cIt's just been horror story after horror story,\u201d she said. Vargas added that her physical health has suffered because she is often left without help. \u201cThese people [PCAs] work way too hard to get a little measly check, that they can't invest in their own insurance.\u201dQuincy resident Dan Harris said that he wouldn\u2019t be able to live on his own without personal care attendants. \u201cI\u2019m a person with a disability who relies on personal care attendants to be able to live the most independent life that I can,\u201d he said outside Healey\u2019s office. \u201cAnd I feel like I\u2019m fighting for my life, because personal care attendants are my lifeline to the community.\u201d State Sen. Lydia Edwards was also at the rally, which was sponsored by healthcare union 1199SEIU, the Boston Center for Independent Living and numerous other elderly support and disability organizations.Edwards\u2019 mother was a personal care attendant, and she says that she saw firsthand how vital their work is, yet they are often struggling themselves with low wages.\u201cIndependently living, with dignity and respect, supported by jobs that pay a living wage, is the only future I\u2019m going to accept,\u201d Edwards said in front of The Embrace statue. Deborah Stephens, a PCA who lives in Chicopee, says she regularly works 50 hours a week, the maximum she is allowed, to help cover other PCAs when they\u2019re unable to work. Better benefits, like more sick time, would help, she said.\u201cIf I get sick, they [the consumers] don't have anyone to take care of them. I don't have sick wages. I only have PTO,\u201d she said while marching through the Common. \u201cI'm 61 years old. I'm approaching retirement age myself, but I want to be able to have something to retire with.\u201dIsaias Ruiz, a PCA who says he finds his work rewarding, said that the state should pay healthcare workers more, and also help them pay for expensive certifications. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have to work three or four jobs to make ends meet,\u201d he said at the labor union hall. \u201cAnd we should be able to save and invest for retirement.\u201dBefore taking office, Healey pledged to support the PCA program and improve conditions. Marchers hope she keeps that promise, and improves the home care system as the state\u2019s population ages.\u201cThis will affect all of us because sooner or later \u2014 I will get old. You'll get old. What happens then? We\u2019re just going to fail the elderly,\u201d Vargas said.Have your sayGBH News is teaming up for statewide coverage of Gov. Healey's first months in office with New England Public Media in Western Massachusetts and CAI on the Cape, coast and islands.

        "body": "In terms of governing, it was Maura Healey\u2019s biggest week yet. The still new(ish) governor unveiled a sprawling tax plan worth nearly $750 million \u2014 bigger than the one former Gov. Charlie Baker tried to pass last year. And a couple days later, Healey released her first-ever state budget proposal, which totals $55.5 billion. So what did Healey get right, and where did she drop the ball? While Healey is a Democrat who\u2019s been lionized by progressives over the years, the reaction to her tax plan and budget doesn\u2019t break down neatly according to ideological lines. Adam Reilly is joined by Charlie Chieppo of the right-leaning Pioner Institute, who sees much to like in Healey\u2019s proposals, and Phineas Baxandall of the left-leaning Mass. Budget and Policy Center, who\u2019s more skeptical. Lisa Kashinsky, the author of Politico\u2019s Massachusetts Playbook, also weighs in on the reception Healey\u2019s proposals have received and the political path that awaits them on Beacon Hill.Watch: Maura Healey\u2019s budget draws split reactions on education, tax reliefTell us: what do you make of Healey\u2019s tax plan and budget?

        "body": "With the endless slew of bad news infiltrating headlines every day, it\u2019s easy to slip into what some call a \u201cdoomer\u201d mindset, filled with helplessness, aimlessness and apathy. So the All Things Considered team wants to highlight some of the great work our local leaders are doing to fight that dreary outlook, all while giving back to their communities. To kick off the \u201cJoy Beat,\u201d Tavares Brewington, founder of the nonprofit Street2Ivy, sat down with All Things Considered host Arun Rath to discuss his work empowering underserved communities through entrepreneurship and helping to fill gaps created by longstanding wealth disparities. Brewington was recently honored as one of the Forbes Next 1000, which celebrates small business owners across the country. What follows is a lightly edited transcript.Arun Rath: I gave a vague, bland description in the intro, but give us a bit more detailed explanation about what Street2Ivy\u2019s mission is and how it came into being.Tavares Brewington: At Street2Ivy, our mission is really to bring the joy and the power of innovation and entrepreneurship to young people from underserved communities who may not have access to those tools. Street2Ivy came into being after I graduated after a long career as an attorney. I went back to business school at Cornell University and participated in their Innovation Program and really fell in love with it. I wanted to bring that knowledge back to the community, so that\u2019s what Street2Ivy is and where it came from. Rath: I\u2019ve been blessed to be pretty privileged growing up and have that kind of privilege for my kids. But I know the kind of opportunities you\u2019re talking about, things like entrepreneurship and these kinds of ways in, they all take time and money. How do you pull that together for people who don\u2019t have access to time and money easily? Brewington: You\u2019re absolutely right, but what we really focus on is the information and knowledge and the process of innovation and design thinking and the power that\u2019s in that. What we really focus on in our program is really helping young people learn the information. We also want them to build confidence that they can work with the information, and we try and connect them with business leaders in the city. The core of the program is really about creating leaders in the community. We teach young people how to think about a problem, how to isolate it, state it specifically and then develop a solution, a draft solution or a mock-up of a solution, and go back to the community that they seek to serve and get the customer feedback to perfect it. Ultimately, we work with them on the financial modeling piece and marketing and how you raise capital. But at the core, it\u2019s really about how you become a problem solver. How do you isolate a problem? You identify a solution and work with those who are in your community and are dealing with that problem to come up with a solution that works. So that\u2019s what we really want to get across through our programming. Rath: My next question was about how Street2Ivy has grown. It sounds like what you\u2019re talking about is seeing a problem and finding out a way to try to fix it. Talk about that growth because you\u2019ve started with an online academy, right? And there\u2019s a magazine and these youth programs. Tell us about the journey.Brewington: So the first program we were able to run, we actually partnered with the Boston branch of the NAACP, and we ran it as a part of Gov. Baker\u2019s Summer Nights program. We have a group of 20 kids who participate in a six-week program, and it was a success. We even had the governor come in and sit through some of the modules that we had. The kids really enjoy that. Every program culminates into a \"Shark Tank\"-like presentation. After that initial program focused on traditional entrepreneurship, we actually developed a real estate development program that works with developers in the city to teach young people about that space as well. So we\u2019ve grown. We\u2019ve been lucky enough to run a number of these programs over the last four to five years, and it\u2019s been exciting. More and more young people are seeing the benefit of creativity, how to harness their creativity and the value of having a framework by which they can take their idea from just an idea to something that\u2019s tangible and can have an impact. Rath: I want to talk about your work in Seaport because something that I didn\u2019t even stop to think about really \u2014 honestly, embarrassingly \u2014 and I was reading about what would be a historic first for Massachusetts: a historically Black college or university. It\u2019s kind of mad, if you think about it, that there isn\u2019t that already in Boston. Tell us your thoughts about that and how you think we might get there. Brewington: We\u2019re part of a team that submitted a response to a request for a proposal from the Massachusetts Convention Center Authority to develop a tract of land in the Seaport. Part of the proposal is to offer a development of an art gallery that would focus on Black and brown artists. But it\u2019s more than a gallery; it\u2019s really a space for artists and creatives to come and learn their craft and the business. In addition to that, we\u2019ve proposed a design center where we will work with you people to really have a place to innovate. Part of that is partnering with Pensole Lewis College of Business and Design, which is a historically Black college based in Detroit. It\u2019s run by Dr. D\u2019Wayne Edwards, who was the manager of Michael Jordan\u2019s Air Jordan brand for decades. He specializes in sneaker design, which is becoming a huge thing amongst young people. There are a lot of sneaker artists; it\u2019s an $86 billion industry, and Massachusetts has a special place in that industry because we have most of the major brands here in Massachusetts. What we\u2019re proposing is to work with Pensole Lewis to run courses around sneaker design and business to help more young people enter that market and enter into an industry that\u2019s so big in this state.Rath: Something I know about from my teenage son now is that there are fortunes to be made in sneakers these days. Brewington: Yeah, it\u2019s really exciting. I mean, it\u2019s something that all kids love. I think it brings people from all backgrounds together, and it would just be a historic opportunity to really provide that opportunity for young people in the city, really to get involved in the industry that\u2019s worldwide \u2014 people love sneakers, and they love the design aspect all over the world. I think having that in Boston, next to the convention center, we can see it being an attraction that brings people from all over the place here to Massachusetts on the diversity and inclusion side. Really, it gives young people who may not have an opportunity, chance or resource where they can learn to generate wealth for themselves, and also highlights the rich culture that exists, the diverse culture that actually exists in Boston.Rath: Why Seaport?Brewington: The Seaport is an up-and-coming area. I\u2019ve been in Boston for a while and have seen it grow, but we want to make sure that everyone has access and feels welcome there. To the extent we can, we want to make sure that there are resources for everyone and attractions for everyone. It\u2019s just a wonderful place to be, but we wanted to make it a wonderful place to be for the greatest number of people and have it really reflect that rich, diverse culture that is Boston.",

Case in point: Gov. Maura Healey\u2019s decision to create a cabinet-level climate chief position, who would be responsible for crafting a cohesive climate change response. But what if that isn\u2019t enough?

That\u2019s when a series of collisions, derailments and fires prompted a rare federal investigation into the operation of the agency's subway system.In a statement announcing the audit, DiZoglio said it will focus on \u201csafety risk management and overall areas of improvement,\u201d and she plans to share the findings with Gov.

But Brian Kane, the executive director of the MBTA Advisory Board, questioned the need for a state audit at this time.\u201cWhat the T doesn't need right now is more people coming in and telling them what they're not doing,\" Kane told GBH News. \"What they need is people coming in and helping them to do the things they need to do.\u201dKane said officials already know the T is not performing well.\"The reasons for that are very well documented: it's personnel and it's money,\" he said. \"In a lot of cases, it's not a surprise.\u201dIn her announcement, DiZoglio said the interest of taxpayers underscored the need for an audit. \u201cSafety issue after issue has arisen and the taxpayers continue to be on the hook,\" she said. \"Taxpayers deserve to know how their dollars are being spent.\u201d That appears to be at odds with a Feb. 15 letter sent to state Transportation Secretary Gina Fiandaca, in which DiZoglio's office described the probe as a \u201cperformance audit\u201d and not a financial one. There is a line that provides more detail about the specific scope of the audit, but most it has been redacted.

        "body": "Half of Massachusetts doctors surveyed have already or intend to soon cut back their clinical hours, and one in four plan to leave medicine altogether in the coming years, according to new data released Thursday by a leading industry group.Fueling concerns about staffing shortages that have plagued the health care industry and many other facets of the economy, the Massachusetts Medical Society said its survey of more than 500 members found a majority \"experienced symptoms that reach the threshold for burnout.\"Nearly 27% of respondents said they have already reduced their clinical work, and another 24% said they are \"definitely\" or \"likely\" to do so by June, according to the report. And the survey found high chances of further hits to the physician workforce: 14.2% said they \"definitely\" will leave the field in the next two years, alongside 12.8% who said their forthcoming departure is \"likely.\"Signs of strain were stronger among certain demographic groups. About 63% of female doctors who participated in the survey showed symptoms of burnout, compared to 47% of male physicians.The most common workplace stressors doctors cited were increased documentation requirements, a lack of available support staff, time devoted to prior authorization needs, non-medical administrators overreaching into medical decision-making and resource allocation, and turnover of staff.MMS President Ted Calianos said the survey results \"are not wholly surprising nor inconsistent with what is happening across the country, but they are distressing.\"\"The scourge of physician burnout and compromised well-being among physicians and members of the health care team remains a threat to public health and patient care,\" Calianos said. \"The unprecedented stress placed upon health care workers and the health care system during the COVID-19 pandemic expectedly exacerbated an already troubling situation.\"Health care employers have been struggling with staffing issues for months. Last year, the Mass. Health and Hospital Association estimated Massachusetts hospitals were about 19,000 full-time workers short.",

        "body": "Last year, Massachusetts legislators approved a pilot program to let 10 cities and towns ban fossil fuels in new buildings. Now, lawmakers and advocates are urging the state to streamline how municipalities participate and let them start doing it \u2014 soon. \u201cIt's important that state government permit the towns that want to do this to go forward as quickly as possible,\u201d state Sen. Mike Barrett told GBH News. \u201cThe Legislature wrote this language because a handful of towns had already moved way out in front. The communities had gone through the laborious process of drafting local bylaws and ordinances.\u201d The state\u2019s Department of Energy Resources released draft regulations and a model rule at the end of December, soliciting public comment up through last week. The law mandates that, for participating communities, both new construction and major renovations would have to be fossil fuel\u2013free operations, with some exceptions for settings like research labs and hospitals. Under DOER\u2019s proposed regulations, municipalities that have already asked the state for permission to ban fossil fuels in new construction, via a home-rule petition sent to Beacon Hill, would need to wait until early 2024 at the earliest to implement their bans. It \u201cproposes to delay the entire process much longer than the Legislature ever imagined,\u201d Barrett said. Many are impatient to get the ball rolling after then-Gov. Charlie Baker signed the legislation last summer, which will go into effect July 1. In addition to moving up the timeline, some lawmakers worry about red tape baked into the DOER\u2019s drafts that could create a stop-start process as each municipality vies for state approval, one by one. Advocacy groups also raised broader concerns that restricting the pilot program to just 10 communities could create problems of its own: holding the state back in meeting its energy goals, and deepening inequity because many of the first cities and towns to apply for this program are wealthy municipalities. \u201cThe Department of Energy of Resources appreciates all comments and will take them into consideration as it works to finalize regulations for the Municipal Fossil Fuel Free Building Demonstration Program and implement them as quickly as practicable,\u201d wrote Danielle Burney in an email, a spokesperson for the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, which oversees the DOER. The law requires that the first 10 cities and towns to send home-rule petitions to the State House should get priority to participate. But at least some of those first 10 communities will likely not be able to take part because of legislative guardrails on the program. Worried about stymying new construction in municipalities where affordable housing is already in short supply, the law requires all participants to either meet an affordable housing threshold or certain zoning code requirements. Arlington, for one, is first in line for the project \u2014 but it falls below the state\u2019s affordable housing threshold. Talia Fox, the town\u2019s sustainability manager, is confident Arlington will ultimately qualify for the project and that it plans to modify its zoning bylaws. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve designed the timeline of that process so that we are eligible to participate in the fossil fuel\u2013free demonstration project,\u201d she told GBH News. Those who ultimately do not qualify will be able to withdraw from the program to make way for other cities and towns to take their place. State Rep. Mike Connolly represents both Cambridge and Somerville on Beacon Hill. While Cambridge is one of the first 10 communities and has a spot in the program, Somerville was the 11th to submit its petition to the Legislature. City and state officials who represent the city are pushing the DOER to include it in their program, and speed up the evaluation of \u201dsubstitute\u201d communities who do not fall in the prioritized group. \u201cI want to strongly urge DOER to consider both prioritized communities and substitute applications on a rolling basis,\u201d Connolly wrote. \u201cOur legislative intent was to establish a demonstration program that could effectively be used to collect data and prove the viability of the fossil fuel free building concept, and the value of the program will be enhanced if we can get to a place where a full set of ten participating municipalities are all able to get going with the program as quickly as possible.\u201dSoon after Somerville filed its petition, Boston did the same, asking the state for permission to ban new fossil fuel hookups. A 2021 city report found that 69% of Boston\u2019s emissions come from buildings. Electric companies like National Grid also pointed to the need for clarity on what demands each new all-electric development will put on the electric grid. The company suggested, in a written comment, that customers \u201cshould be required to consult with their local electric distribution company to ensure that the local electric system infrastructure is equipped to accommodate alternatives to fossil fuel on a case-by-case basis.\u201d Other advocates say the state needs to allow more municipalities to go fossil fuel free, a change that would have to come from the Legislature. Lisa Cunningham is the co-founder of ZeroCarbonMA and has pushed for Brookline to ban fossil fuel hookups for years. She pointed out that many of the \u201csubstitute\u201d communities hoping for approval \u2014 such as Boston and Somerville \u2014 represent a huge part Massachusetts\u2019 population and have much larger poor and minority populations. Northampton, meanwhile, is the only community in Western Massachusetts that is looking to take part. \u201cIt really seems counterproductive to limit the number of communities in this pilot program, arbitrarily limit them to 10 communities,\u201d Cunningham said. \u201cIt's not fair, from an equity point of view, really \u2014 it's not fair from an environmental justice point of view \u2014 to allow all these relatively wealthy communities to have first-come, first-serve at this program and then to exclude these other communities.\u201d Logan Malik, the interim executive director of the Massachusetts Climate Action Network, agreed. \u201cWe know that the future is electric. We know that we will need to electrify our buildings, and communities across the commonwealth deserve the right, the opportunity, to decide for themselves,\u201d he added. Much of Massachusetts\u2019 fossil fuel hookup debate has centered on Brookline for the past several years. The town passed local rules that would ban fossil fuels in new construction \u2014 twice \u2014 but they were halted by then-Attorney General Maura Healey, who said there needed to be action at the state level for such a change to legally go forward in Massachusetts. Brookline is one of the 10 communities that will be eligible to participate in the pilot program.Barrett argues that urgency is essential, beyond the impacts of just the first 10 cities and towns, because the hope is that data gathered from the pioneering communities will help create a roadmap forward for how to meet the state\u2019s ambitious climate goals. \u201cThe additional delays anticipated by the draft regulation mean that we will remain in the dark about how to move forward on our climate strategy for additional months,\u201d the senator said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping the state hears us and hastens the process along.\u201d",

        "body": "Funding has dried up for clinical services at the Roundhouse Hotel near Massachusetts Avenue and Melnea Cass Boulevard, commonly referred to as Mass. and Cass. People experiencing homelessness and substance use disorder have received medical care and housing at the hotel since a sweep of a nearby homeless encampment in December 2021. A Boston Medical Center clinic at the formerly abandoned hotel will shut down by the end of March, according to a spokesperson for the medical center. The clinic currently provides area residents with access to clinical staff, methadone clinics, emergency triage and resources to cope with withdrawal and intoxication \u2014 all efforts to reduce strain on nearby emergency rooms.The city will continue to provide transitional housing at the Roundhouse Hotel until the end of June, and is currently \u201clooking for other sites to decentralize\u201d while \u201cevaluating what options are available to us\u201d in the interim, according to a spokesman for Mayor Michelle Wu.\u201cAny reduction in services is going to negatively impact the population of people experiencing homelessness and people who use drugs,\u201d said Azzy Mae, a harm reduction activist and member of the New England Users Union, a local advocacy group for people who use drugs. \u201cWith the warmer months approaching, it\u2019s important that the services are near where folks are congregating. It\u2019s definitely not the time to be reducing services.\u201d The closure comes after months of stalled negotiations between Boston Medical Center and neighborhood groups on a memorandum of agreement about a long-term plan and final end date for services at the Roundhouse. \u201cIt\u2019s not that the services aren\u2019t necessary, just not there,\u201d said Sue Sullivan, executive director of the Newmarket Business Association, who suggested the creation of an \u201cenclave\u201d of housing and clinical support in another part of Roxbury, Dorchester or South Boston. \u201cI see loitering, vandalism and aggressive panhandling. For those reasons, all the neighboring businesses will be very glad to see them leave.\u201dThe Roundhouse is one of several low-threshold housing sites established for unhoused people at Mass. and Cass, including Willow at Woods Mullen, Southampton Dorm 1 and the Envision Hotel. The city budgeted $21,269,552 in federal funding to support these sites through the end of this year, and 180 residents are currently living across six sites, according to data provided by the city. Other services will continue in the area, including city- and federal grant\u2013funded programs and clinical services at the Engagement Center on Atkinson Street, harm reduction efforts through the AHOPE program, and city collaborations with nonprofits including the Whittier Street Health Center and Victory Programs, according to the Boston Public Health Commission. \u201cWe are grateful to our partners at BMC for their collaboration in supporting the city\u2019s public health response to the substance use and homelessness crises at Mass. and Cass,\u201d a Boston Public Health Commission spokesperson said in a statement, adding that the commission will continue \u201cto direct individuals to their day spaces so they can access the wraparound services they need.\u201dPeople experiencing homelessness have been \u201cforced into a concentration at Mass. and Cass,\u201d May said, an already disenfranchised area of the city that has grappled for years with a lack of resources and support. \u201cIf we want to decentralize, if we want folks to be enmeshed in society in a way that they can be accepted, then we need to have programs all over the place,\u201d they said. \u201cBut in the meantime, we need to meet people where they\u2019re at \u2014 and not just in a philosophical sense. We need proximity.\u201d",

        "body": "By now you\u2019ve heard that Mayor Michelle Wu vetoed the proposal to restore an elected school committee and reverse Boston\u2019s position as an outlier with the only mayor-appointed school committee in the commonwealth. What you may not know: She recently signed a separate piece of legislation that would make Boston an outlier in a new, different way by giving voting power to the school committee\u2019s student representatives. The Boston School Committee currently has one non-voting student representative. The measure now headed to the statehouse would add spots for two voting student representatives and an alternate. The Boston Student Advisory Council would elect the positions.It\u2019s an under-the-radar aspect of the school committee scuffle, but one that those at the intersection of youth and civic engagement say could have far-reaching implications if it clears the now daunting Beacon Hill process. Currently, Boston School Committee student reps \u2014 those that represent the interests of stakeholders with the greatest interest in Boston Public Schools \u2014 lack a say in the policies and decisions that directly impact BPS\u2019 49,000 or so students.Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, director at the Tufts-based, nonpartisan Center for Information Research & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE), says that\u2019s an issue.\u201cStudent voice is essential. ... Young people have the most immediate, current and deepest knowledge about what's happening in their own classroom and in their curriculum. And nobody else can comment about what the actual student experiences are,\u201d she told GBH News. \u201cIt's the kind of expertise the school board needs to be able to make decisions together with young people that actually reflect student views, experience and opinions.\u201d Advocates like Kawashima-Ginsberg see student suffrage as a preferred way to promote civic engagement and do it while the youth are still in school, able to engage with their peers as well as adults.But Glenn Koocher, executive director of the Massachusetts Association of School Committees, said Boston could be \u201copening up a can of worms\u201d by allowing students to have a vote because of their stakeholder status. \u201cThen the union president is going to want to vote, then the special education PAC is going to want to vote, and everybody is going to have a legitimate claim to demanding a voice at the table,\u201d Koocher told GBH News. \u201cSo at some point you've got to default to the traditional rules of democracy and say if you're elected, you get a seat at the table and a vote.\u201d In addition to the slippery stakeholder slope, Koocher said there\u2019s \u201ca legitimate question regarding how students become fully and responsibly aware of their obligations to think critically and fairly.\u201d To be clear, the Massachusetts Association of School Committees generally abstains from taking sides on school committee governance questions in honor of local control.\u201cWe support the right of the community to make its own decision about how to elect its local elected officials,\u201d Koocher said. \u201cSo whatever Boston determines is for Boston and not for us\u201d to determine.The Boston School Committee, through a BPS communications official, declined to comment. The matter now moves to the Legislature, which, as it often does, will determine what Boston can and cannot do.SeparatorThis story first ran in GBH News\u2019 politics newsletter.

        "body": "Boston began its rent control discussion in earnest Wednesday as the City Council\u2019s government operations committee held its first hearing on the proposal from Mayor Michelle Wu that would cap annual rent increases at 10% and establish legal protections for evictions. Looming over the day\u2019s proceedings was the specter of the reluctant state Legislature, which has not shown an appetite for considering rent control since the policy was banned statewide through a voter referendum in 1994.\u201cI don't want to see us ... divided and have a big free-for-all when, you know, if there\u2019s not a likelihood of success. We should probably try to ascertain that sooner rather than later,\u201d At-Large Councilor Michael Flaherty said. Flaherty, who shepherded a just-cause eviction measure through the council in 2017, recalled that the city\u2019s last major attempt to enact rental market rules was thwarted at the state level. \u201cThe council gets them through, the mayor signs them and then they hit the brick wall heading up the hill,\u201d Flaherty said of housing initiaitves.City housing chief Sheila Dillon defended the proposal, saying it would provide consistency to developers and protect tenants from unreasonable evictions and rent hikes. \u201cPeople who are suggesting that growth will stop are misleading. What the home-rule petition does stop, however, is behavior that harms our residents,\u201d she said in her opening statements.But councilors began gently suggesting amendments to Wu\u2019s plan.Multiple councilors took issue with the aspect of the proposal that would exempt buildings from rent control 15 years from their opening, arguing it could be shorter and not apply retroactively. Dillon indicated she would reexamine that point with the city\u2019s legal team. Councilors also raised other opportunities for changing Wu's proposal. At-Large Councilor Ruthzee Louijeune said she would push for a right-to-counsel policy to be rolled into the proposal so that renters facing evictions would be guaranteed legal representation.\u201cI think it\u2019s incredibly important that we try to balance out powers\u2019 asymmetry that exists in housing court when it comes to landlords, who are often well-resourced with attorneys and with representation, versus tenants who are not,\u201d Louijeune said.Council President Ed Flynn also suggested property tax relief for landlords who rent below market rate. \u201cIn South Boston I see a lot of landlords, or housing providers, renting out an apartment to someone in need at times ... and they\u2019re charging a rent that\u2019s below market rate,\u201d Flynn said. \u201cI proposed a formula or something that would help that landlord keep that practice going.\u201dDillon said it was \u201ca good idea,\u201d and one she would run by the rest of the administration.At least one councilor, Kendra Lara, indicated she would oppose Wu\u2019s plan unless the rent-increase cap was lowered. Right now, Wu\u2019s plan allows for annual increases at the rate of inflation, determined by Boston\u2019s regional U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics consumer price index, plus 6%. In years with high inflation, the total annual increase would be capped at 10%.\u201cFrom what I know, from 2007 to 2020, the citywide average [for rent increases] was CPI plus 2%,\u201d Lara said, insisting Wu\u2019s proposed cap is too high. \u201cI don\u2019t see a good reason for it besides the fact that we think the state Legislature would be friendlier to CPI plus 6%.\u201dRent control has long been controversial. A GBH News survey of public comments during Wu\u2019s policy formulation period showed that even those willing to comment on the issue were essentially split. Last month, when Wu floated certain aspects of her proposal to the public, signs of the coming debate emerged. This week, officials with the Greater Boston Real Estate Board launched a nearly half-million-dollar campaign to oppose the policy. The next council hearing on the matter is scheduled for next Thursday, when the body will hear more comments from the public on the issue.",

        "body": "Officials from the Western Massachusetts towns of Charlemont and Hawley sent Gov. Maura Healey a letter pushing for an extra $60 million in funding for rural districts and schools with declining enrollment. \u201cNow is the time to act. The state has considerable existing resources, as well as expected revenues from the \u2018Fair Share Amendment.\u2019 Our small towns do not,\u201d Hawlemont School Committee Chair Kenneth Bertsch wrote, referring to a new state tax on high-earners. \u201cWe have economized and provided strong, local support for our schools, but we need more help.\u201dThe request would increase spending for rural schools from $4 million currently to $60 million. Healey is expected to unveil her first annual budget proposal as governor next week.The Mohawk Trail Regional School District covers 250 square miles, and lost 40% of its enrollment between 2000 and 2018. Mohawk Trail School Committee Chair Martha Thurber said the state's funding formula, which is based on the number of students enrolled in a district, does not reflect the fixed costs to heat, electrify and maintain its school buidings despite having fewer students. \u201cWe have cut, scraped and consolidated. We've closed schools, but we are still in deep financial distress,\u201d Thurber said. \"We are saying it's time to actually do something and fund this appropriately.\u201dA similar problem has plagued the Boston Public Schools, the state's most populous school district. As enrollment has declined in recent years, the city of Boston has had to allocate tens of millions annually to help the district cover the shortfall and keep schools with empty seats in operation.Bertsch said he wants to see state legislators work to ensure that rural districts get the help they need from state coffers.\u201cThe reason we sent this letter right now is that the governor is finalizing her budget,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the time for them to voice their opinion.\u201d",

        "body": "Makenzi Buckely answered the phone at Riverside Community Care location in Norwood, and took a call from a worried mom, requesting a mental health evaluation for her child.\u201cAnd you would like that to happen today?\u201d Buckley asked. \u201cOK. So, looking at my schedule, we could probably come out for 12:30, 1 o\u2019clock.\u201dThis kind of mobile response is one of the services offered here and at 24 other community behavioral health centers or CBHCs that opened across Massachusetts in January. It\u2019s a new statewide experiment in addressing mental health and addiction issues by funding a comprehensive range of services for patients. For now, though, insurance coverage issues prevent roughly three-quarters of patients from accessing much of the care these new centers provide.In addition to mobile response services like the team Buckley dispatched to do an evaluation, another service CBHCs provide is essentially a walk-in urgent care center for mental health and substance use disorders. They also offer overnight beds for patients who need that level of support and observation. \"What we've basically done is construct a whole new model of care,\" said Riverside President Vicker DiGravio. The way the state set up this new system allows for care from a whole team, he said.\u201cTeams with expertise in substance use disorders, co-occurring disorders, mental health issues, teams that specialize in serving children and adolescents,\u201d DiGravio said. \u201cAnd the team involves a clinician and includes a care coordinator. It includes a peer specialist or a family partner.\" The state also required CBHCs to have phlebotomy labs on site to test for drugs, make sure medication levels are OK, and other analysis.A directory of community behavioral health centers in Massachusetts is online here.The launch of this system was one of the last big initiatives celebrated by former Gov. Charlie Baker \u2014 perhaps the crowning achievement of his administration's so-called Roadmap for Behavioral Health Reform. \u201cThis is incredibly innovative and it has the potential to be transformative for a variety of reasons,\u201d said Lydia Conley, president and CEO of the Association for Behavioral Healthcare, which represents mental health and addiction treatment centers in Massachusetts, including almost all of the new CBHCs.\u201cIt funds behavioral health on a level that it should be,\u201d Conley said. \u201cIt is a specialty. It has never been adequately resourced. This model adequately resources it.\u201dThe difference, Conley said, isn\u2019t just that the state is paying more to support mental health and addiction treatment. There\u2019s a whole different model for paying for those services.Usually, insurance companies bill for every individual service a patient gets. But for those who are covered for care at a CBHC, there\u2019s just one rate for their combined services.\u201dSo if we provide one service, we bill the bundle and we get that rate,\u201d DiGravio explained. \u201cIf we provide three or four services in one day, we bill the bundle once and we still get the same rate.\u201dThat means patients can get a broader range of services that they didn\u2019t used to have access to, DiGravio said.\u201cHopefully, we\u2019ll do a better job meeting the needs of the individuals we serve and helping them to avoid accessing higher, more expensive levels of care including emergency departments and inpatient hospitalizations,\u201d he said.While care at these centers is covered for about 1.5 million people under MassHealth, the state\u2019s Medicaid program, roughly three-quarters of insured people in Massachusetts have private insurance or Medicare, neither of which cover these services.A few insurance companies have signed up to cover CHBC care. But most haven't, and they aren't required to. \"It doesn't feel comfortable on the service delivery side to have sort of a two-tiered model or be offering care in two different ways when we feel very passionately that that full complement of services is what people need,\" said Kimberly Fisher, vice president of behavioral health services at Riverside.CBHCs won\u2019t turn away anyone in crisis, and a state law requires private insurers to cover immediate care in those kinds of emergencies. Also, private insurers can be billed individually for some of the services at CBHCs. But patients can\u2019t get coverage for recovery coaches, peer specialists, and other services like the in-house lab. The Massachusetts Association of Health Plans says some may be planning to contract with CBHCs, and others may still be evaluating the idea, since the program is in its early stages.DiGravio said he hopes more insurance companies will sign up once they can prove this model has better outcome and is more cost effective. And, he said, employers can play a role. \"If employers want their employees to have access to these services, they need to let the health plans they contract with know that this needs to be part of the benefit package,\" DiGravio said.Also, state legislation has been filed that would compel insurance companies to cover care at CBHCs.\u201cI'm really hopeful that this legislation and my bill will make these treatment service providers available to everybody in our community, whether you have MassHealth or Blue Cross Blue Shield, you name it,\u201d said state Sen. John Cronin, who introduced the bill.That legislation isn\u2019t going to pass overnight, though. Cronin said he\u2019s hoping in the next year or two to get an analysis of the bill from the Center for Health Information Analysis, which should be able to make it more clear which insurance companies the state could require to cover this kind of care.",

        "body": "You likely noticed the clouds have been increasing today, and this trend will continue through sunset leading to precipitation this evening. I expect a mixed bag to arrive between 5 and 8 p.m., moving from west to east. Somewhere around 6 or 7 p.m., precipitation should be heading into the greater Boston area.The type of precipitation you\u2019ll see will depend on where you are. This is a very marginal situation in terms of precipitation type. It's not out of the question that we could see all four major precipitation types within 30 miles. The reason for the kitchen sink version of weather is a warm tongue of air pushing in at high levels of the atmosphere this evening. This will help create the lift necessary for snow, sleet, freezing rain and rain but will also make forecasting the exact type difficult.The trend overnight will be for the precipitation to transition to rain in all but the most northern areas. Before this happens we could see anywhere from a coating to a couple of inches of slop. If you're traveling, because temperatures will be within a few degrees of freezing, road conditions can change quickly. But I don't expect major issues.Tomorrow there will be a sharp contrast in temperature across southern New England. The map below shows readings in the lower 20s west of Route 128, but still in the lower 30s south of Boston. This type of setup can evolve into icy conditions fairly quickly as temperatures drop rapidly. Do not underestimate how quickly roads can become icy with even just a small amount of glaze.The risk for icing continues Thursday night with some additional light precipitation. You should be careful stepping out Friday morning as walkways could be icy. Again, this is not a major situation by any means. But untreated surfaces can become very hazardous with the thinnest of coatings. On Friday readings should get above freezing in greater Boston as sunshine returns.It becomes quite cold for Saturday morning with readings in the single digits west of the city. It will only reach the 20s Saturday afternoon. There could be a few snow showers on Sunday and it will not be as cold. There may be another messy weather system before we conclude February. Winter may not have been bad so far, but it isn\u2019t over yet.",

        "body": "Gov. Maura Healey\u2019s first several weeks in office have been a time of foundation-building: putting together her team, reintroducing herself to top lawmakers, and publicly setting the goals that will define her tenure as she leads Massachusetts. She has sketched out a first-term agenda that keys on pressing issues facing the state, like the hefty price tags for housing and child care and the threats of climate change. As a candidate and now in office, \u201caffordability\u201d has been a common refrain for Healey. With her blueprints drawn up, the questions now become how she\u2019ll deliver, and how her priorities match up with those of her constituents.Healey wants to tackle housing costs that make it too expensive for renters and homeowners alike to live in Massachusetts. She plans to name a housing secretary, turn unused state land into new housing, expand deductions for renters and help first-time homebuyers.She also aims to make sure education is accessible, and see that young people have the mental health care, food security and other resources they need to thrive. Her education agenda aligns with her goal of easing pervasive, economy-wide workforce shortages. To help workers learn the skills employers are looking for, she wants to make community college free for adults over 25 without degrees. Healey also promised the plan to fund the free community college program in the state budget she'll file next month, which will also include money for 1,000 extra workers focused on MBTA operations. The safety of the T \u2014 and its basic ability to function like it's supposed to \u2014 is another area the governor's zeroed in on, along with securing federal funding to help fix dilapidated roads and bridges across the state. As governor, Healey established climate as a focal point early on, adding a climate chief to her Cabinet on her first full day office. She wants to bet big on climate technology, research, innovating and manufacturing, and create jobs in the process. However, the overall cost of living is the key issue for Healey and other elected leaders, according to MassINC Polling Group President Steve Koczela. He said more people think Massachusetts is headed in the right direction than not, but he sees some consistent concerns show up in his organization\u2019s surveys. \u201cCost of living is right up there,\u201d Koczela said. \u201cIt\u2019s expressed in different ways. It's the cost of health care, it's inflation, it's the cost of living in general. All of those kind of tie back to the same thing.\"This aligns with voter sentiment in a UMass Amherst poll in Massachusetts at the tail end of the 2022 campaign, in which people said they wanted the next governor to address inflation as well as the supply and affordability of housing. Tatishe Nteta, a UMass Amherst political science professor and director of the UMass poll, said this is a time when new governors typically seek to harness their public support to make progress on their major goals.\u201cThis is where leaders step up and articulate their vision for the future of the state, and the question is, is she going to do that or is it just going to be reactive to the problems that we have been dealing with, whether that\u2019s the MBTA or issues of housing, the overarching issues or transportation and economic issues,\u201d Nteta said. \u201cIs she going to be proactive and visionary? Or is she just going to be reactive and managerial?\u201dThe actions Healey and her team take next will reverberate statewide, but they\u2019ll feel different depending on where you are. Transportation needs differ in North Adams and Boston; the housing markets aren\u2019t the same in Provincetown and Springfield. Follow our stories for the next several weeks and learn more as we work with reporters across the state to take a closer look at what the people of Massachusetts have to say about Gov. Maura Healey\u2019s first agenda.SeparatorGBH News is teaming up with New England Public Media in Western, MA and CAI on the Cape, coast and islands, to take a closer look at Governor Healey's political agenda.

        "body": "Former President Donald Trump is set to appear in a Manhattan courtroom Tuesday on charges related to falsifying business records in a hush-money investigation, the first president ever to be charged with a crime.Trump, who has denied any wrongdoing and has repeatedly assailed the investigation, has called the indictment \"political persecution\" and predicted it would damage Democrats in 2024. Trump's lawyers have said the former president \"did not commit any crime. We will vigorously fight this political prosecution in court.\"What to expect:Trump flew into New York from his Mar-a-Lago estate on Monday and is expected to leave Trump Tower on Tuesday and make the nearly four-mile drive to the Manhattan criminal courthouse, where he is scheduled to face a judge for his arraignment at 2:15 p.m. EDT.No. So-called perp walks happen when a criminal suspect is taken in handcuffs out of a police precinct and then driven to the courthouse. But Trump won't be going to a police precinct. He's arranged a surrender with the district attorney's office and will head straight to the court, skipping a police station entirely. It's very unlikely anyone will get a glimpse of him going into court, unless he wants to be seen. That's because there are underground entrances, side doors and tunnels in and around the Manhattan courthouse.Trump will get booked. Here's what that means: Before computers, information on every criminal suspect would be written down in a big book kept by court officials. Now, it's all computerized, but the process is largely the same. Court officers will take down Trump's full name, age, birthdate, height and weight. They'll check to see if the former president has any outstanding warrants. They'll take his fingerprints \u2014 but they won't roll his fingertips in ink; these days that's done by computer, too. Officers will roll each fingertip on a computerized system that records the prints. They may take his photo, known as a mug shot. In New York, this process usually takes about two hours, but can be as long as four. Then he goes before a judge.An arraignment is a hearing in which the indictment will be formally unsealed and the charges will be read aloud, though Trump could request to wave the public reading. He will be asked how he pleads to the charges and he will answer \"guilty\" or \"not guilty.\" And Trump's attorneys Joe Tacopina, Susan Necheles and Todd Blanche will work with the judge and the district attorney's office to set a date for the next time he'd be back in court. The judge has ruled that news photographers would be allowed to take photos of the former president at the start of his arraignment.Technically, yes. When he's fingerprinted and processed, he's considered under arrest and in custody. But it won't look like what it does in the movies or on TV's \"Law & Order.\" He won't be handcuffed and he won't sit in a jail cell, in part because parts of the courthouse will be cleared out for his arraignment \u2014 and because Trump is a former president with Secret Service protection. Not all defendants are handcuffed before they appear before a judge for an arraignment, though some are.It depends. In New York City, mug shots aren't generally made public. They are taken by the law enforcement agency that makes the arrest. There are situations where a judge could make the photo public in response to a public records fight. It could also get leaked.Court officials are trying to limit what business is happening at the courthouse at 100 Centre St. in Lower Manhattan on Tuesday. Police are expected to close some streets around the plaza and security will be tight. The New York Police Department is in charge of security in the city, but state court officers are in charge of security inside the court.In all likelihood, yes. New York's bail laws have been overhauled over the past few years, meaning Trump would be released without bail because the anticipated charges against him don't require that bail be set. But it's possible that Judge Juan Merchan could decide that Trump is a flight risk and order him held in custody, with or without bail. Trump's lawyers would argue that the former president's ties to the U.S. are strong, and because he's a presidential candidate, he has no reason to flee and should be allowed to leave.The judge and legal teams will set dates for the next hearing and deadlines for discovery, in which the district attorney's office must turn over all its information to Trump's lawyers, and motions, which include any requests to shift the venue or dismiss the case outright. That process usually takes months. Tacopina has said he needs to read the indictment first and research before he decides what to do on a change of venue or any motions to dismiss, though it would be very common to file one.",

        "body": "Esmerelda the robot wheeled around the floor, her arms lifting up and down on hydraulics. She scooped up small red-and-blue cones and stacked them onto rods of varying heights, her motors whirring. On the edge of the fenced-in floor, Lexington High School student Anna Labbe gave commands: Up, down, turns and navigations. Her teammates, Nora Kapoor and Arushi Aggarwal, used controllers to drive her around. Esmerelda was designed, programmed and built by members of the Parity Bits, a robotics team for girls and nonbinary students at Lexington High School. Their name is a pun: A parity bit is a form of error-detecting code, added to the end of a string of binary code. It\u2019s also a reference to gender parity in STEM fields. Women make up almost 30 percent of the STEM workforce, according to the professional association STEM Women. The Parity Bits want to increase that number.Esmerelda is about 18 by 18 inches, with purple and gold accents. She weighs about 30 pounds and is made of metal, wood, string and electrical wiring. The Parity Bits take her to competitions, where they and other high school teams see which robot can quickly and most efficiently stack cones. Their mission also extends to outreach: They visit elementary school students, where they present their robots and teach younger students about engineering. The Parity Bits were founded in 2014, born out of a co-ed robotics team at their school, 2 Bits and a Byte, when one member wanted a space for girls to shine \u2014 without being overshadowed by the boys.\u201cI started back in fourth grade, but that was because my brother had a team with all of his guy friends,\u201d Defne Olgun said. \u201cAnd then as I got old enough to join, they were like, Oh, would you like to join us? Because we need girls on our team, so it looks good for the judges. I wasn't always the most confident. I would fiddle around with the Legos, but I wouldn't be the one putting the things onto the robot.\u201dMost of the team had no robotics experience before joining the Parity Bits. Team member Priyanka Iyer says it's a common experience for girls exploring robotics \u2014 and that makes wins even more gratifying.\u201cI think that when I\u2019m in a community where my voice feels overshadowed by men, I sometimes don't feel confident in what I have to say, and I think their ideas are better,\u201d Iyer said. \u201cBut then to be in an all-girls team and show that it is possible and we can do as much as they can. \u2026 To be able to do the same thing and go out and win awards and win matches with them, it feels really cool.\u201dAggrarwal said they foster an environment for learning, and for feeling secure in being able to practice, fail and try again. \u201cYou're not going to be perfect the first time,\u201d Aggrarwal said. \u201cAnd that's something that I think is hard for newcomers to remember. Part of that was saying to our new team members, you're going to be okay. And if you're not okay the first time, after the fourth or fifth or sixth time, Esmerelda is going to be fine and we're all going to be fine together.\u201dOlgun said they also learn how to overcome challenges together. \u201cYes, it might suck when the string snaps for the eighth time that day, but you just have to keep going at it again,\u201d Olgun said. \u201cIt\u2019s also about sharing space and allowing others to take up as much presence in the room as I might sometimes; to fail on purpose and be okay with that process of growing and learning through the engineering process.\u201dThe environment has inspired many of the girls to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and math after high school. Two of the graduating seniors plan to study computer science and robotics, and another plans to study mechanical engineering. They've become close friends along the way, and are leaving a legacy for the underclass girls behind them. \u201cOver the course of the season, we're all trying to learn and grow as a team,\u201d Audi Lin said. \u201cWe want to leave as much as we can behind for future generations.\u201d At the end of the season, Esmerelda will be disassembled. Her parts will be used for a new robot next year.",

        "body": "Labor law expert Terri Gerstein has one word to describe the current trends in child labor: \u201cbizarre.\u201d Recent investigations by The New York Times, the Boston Globe and Reuters revealed cases where kids as young as 12 were working in meatpacking plants, fish processing plants, construction and car factories. Coupled with this surge in child labor law violations, Gerstein said, is a movement by certain state legislatures to remove existing protections. In Arkansas, for example, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed a bill that rolls back age verification requirements for children under 16. Iowa and Minnesota are also considering bills that loosen child labor age restrictions and workplace safety requirements. \u201cIt\u2019s bizarre they\u2019re happening at the same time because when we see an uptick in child labor, logically, that should be when we actually strengthen our laws and try to think about what we can do to protect children,\u201d Gerstein, a fellow at the Center for Labor and a Just Economy at Harvard Law School and the Economic Policy Institute, said on Boston Public Radio. \u201cOur child laws basically prevent kids from doing dangerous work and also from working such long hours that it's harmful to their physical development and their ability to go to school,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I talk about this upsurge in child labor violations, it includes both types.\u201dThere\u2019s a variety of factors contributing to this troubling national trend. There has been an increase in unaccompanied minors entering the United States, who are often the children at the center of these labor law violations. Combine that with a workforce shortage due to the COVID-19 pandemic and some adult workers declining to hold jobs with low wages and poor benefits. Companies have turned to the growing pool of migrant children to fill their place, Gerstein said.Many recognizable brands have been cited in these violations, like Cheerios, Walmart, Target and General Motors. These companies have mostly been able to avoid punishment, however, by placing the blame on staffing and temp agencies, subcontractors and franchises who directly hired the children. Gerstein said there needs to be a \u201cchain of liability\u201d in the supply chains of companies that have child labor so that if a subcontractor violates workers' rights, the general contractor is still held accountable.The government has sometimes failed to enforce these laws because federal workplace agencies \u201chave been starved of funds for years and years,\u201d Gerstein said. Additionally, the number of U.S. Department of Labor Wage & Hour Division investigators declined by a quarter between 2010-2019, while the number of workers per investigator more than doubled since 1979. While federal enforcement is stretched thin, many states don\u2019t even have state-level investigators, Gerstein added.Some lawmakers are taking action. A bipartisan bill introduced to the U.S. House of Representatives in March will increase penalties for companies found guilty of child labor law violations. While harshening penalties is important, Gerstein cautioned that companies may still not be deterred from putting children in unsafe conditions if they don\u2019t think they\u2019ll get caught. \u201cAny improvements in these laws I think is really valuable and important,\u201d said Gerstein. But to really make change, Gerstein said this bill needs to be combined with other measures, like stronger unions for children and work permits for unaccompanied minors that will allow them to secure more appropriate jobs in law-abiding, safer workplaces.",

        "body": "More than 100 respondents in GBH's \"Have your say: Governor Healey's agenda\u201d have listed transportation as a top issue. Bob Seay, GBH\u2019s transportation reporter, joined GBH\u2019s Morning Edition co-host Jeremy Siegel to dig into some of their questions. Want to have your say on how GBH covers Healey\u2019s administration? Fill out our survey here. The MBTA has long had portions of the system where trains run more slowly. But on March 9, the agency announced system-wide slowdowns, capping speeds at either 25 or 10 mph. Usually, trains in some parts of the system can go up to 40 mph. \u201cThe state Department of Public Utilities, which is actually the official oversight agency for the T, began examining Red Line tracks near Savin Hill and JFK/UMass,\u201d Seay said. \u201cAnd they asked the MBTA, Hey, do you guys have any documentation to show that you actually inspected and repaired these tracks? Apparently, that didn't look like that had happened.\u201dAn investigation is underway to figure out why the MBTA did not have documentation of any inspections, and who was responsible, Seay said. \u201cAs a result of that they now have to go through the entire system, inspecting it for possible defects and then when repairing it, verify it and provide that documentation to the DPU,\u201d Seay said. The DPU itself, he noted, \u201cfor many years wasn't really doing its job until the Federal Transit Administration stepped in and said, hey, you guys really have to take a look at what's going on. And suddenly we have this enforcement that's underway.\u201dAbout a quarter of the system is still affected by slow zones, Seay said, a slight improvement from 27 percent last week. That includes slow zones on about 56 percent of the Blue Line; 25 percent of the Red and Orange Lines; and 18 percent of the Green Line.Healey appointed a general manager, Phillip Eng, the former head of the Long Island Rail Road, the largest commuter line in the country.A possible next step? Appointing members of the MBTA\u2019s board of directors, which oversees the agency, Seay said. \u201cThat's going to be really important going forward because governance of the T and oversight of what's going on is really critical,\u201d Seay said. \u201cDuring her campaign, Healey released a transportation plan that said she would overhaul top management at the MBTA. She set aggressive electrification goals and established low-income fares as a pathway to fair free buses.\u201dOther potential priorities: An east-west rail, something transit advocates have long been pushing for, to better serve Western Massachusetts. \u201cThey don't have the transportation they need and they're also looking at boosting up the regional transit authorities, which are vital to that rural transportation network,\u201d Seay said. \u201cSo those are some of the things that that Healey said she would do. And the East-West Rail is something that she has committed to, which is good news for Western Mass. residents.\u201dSeay said he looked at this year\u2019s budgets and found the state does spend more on the MBTA than it does on roads. \u201cIt appears that in Massachusetts we spend about $2 billion a year on roads,\" Seay said. \"We spend twice that much on just the MBTA: $2 billion for operating budget plus $2 billion in capital projects.\u201dThat snapshot does not account for historical investment or other funding streams, like the money cities and towns spend to build and repair roads or federal highway projects. Still Seay said, more investment is needed. \u201cSo there's plenty of money going into MBTA. But there's so much more money that is needed for things like electrification of rail or East-West Rail,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd those are going to be some tough choices that have to be made in the years ahead on Beacon Hill between the governor and the legislature to try to find the money to do the job.\u201d",

        "body": "On a cold, late-winter evening in Roxbury, staccato rhythms punctuated by crashing cymbals flowed from a stately Victorian house on Elm Hill Avenue, where a group of students practiced their drumline formation in the basement. Eighteen-year-old Alan Aunaxe beat a message on his snare drum, then cast a look at a fellow drummer in a playful call and response. \u201cI want everything to sound clean,\u201d Aunaxe said afterward. \u201cYou have to be precise, or else it\u2019s going to sound like a splash.\u201dDrumlines might be a fixture in the U.S. South, but in Boston they are about as common as cheesy grits. Among Boston\u2019s 30 public high schools, there\u2019s just one active marching band \u2014 at English High School. The Hamilton-Garrett Center for Music & Arts decided to create its own drumline as a way to honor African American musical tradition in a city that sometimes overlooks it. \u201cDrumming has a profound importance within Black culture here in the United States of America,\u201d said the Rev. Dr. Emmett Price III, inaugural dean of Africana Studies at the Berklee College of Music.The drumline\u2019s esprit de corps lifts people up, celebrating African musical traditions and the regiments of Black fifers and drummers who fought in the Civil War. Price said it also recalls an era when drumming was a form of resistance, especially when it was banned among enslaved people in the United States.\u201cThere were rebellions that occurred because folks were signaling to each other using drums. Almost like Morse code,\u201d Price said.Against that backdrop, historically Black colleges and universities, also known as HBCUs, turned drumlines at halftime shows into a cultural phenomenon, making appearances with Beyonc\u00e9 at Coachella and Lil Nas X at the Grammys. The drumlines of HBCUs were an inspiring force behind the scenes at Hamilton-Garrett in Boston.Gerami Groover-Flores, the program\u2019s executive director, said she would listen to her father, Rev. Dr. Gregory G. Groover, pastor of the Historic Charles Street African Methodist Episcopal Church, talk about the pride he felt in the marching band from his days at Morehouse College, an HBCU in Atlanta. \u201cThat was a space the historically Black colleges and universities provided for these talented musicians who, at a certain point in our history, did not have access to many of the predominately white [higher ed] institutions,\u201d Groover-Flores said.Groover-Flores left Berklee with undergraduate and graduate degrees, but the feeling resonated even as she studied music in Europe. \u201dI have a deep connection to it,\u201d she said.The drumline at Hamilton-Garrett was also in step with the center\u2019s vision as a space where young people can learn about their musical heritage.Ruth Hamilton, half of the center\u2019s namesake, began offering music lessons for children out of the Charles Street AME church in the early 2000s with just four students.Hamilton was a strong proponent of the Negro spirituals. Elta Garrett, a veteran Boston Public Schools teacher, helped manage the program as it grew. Last year, Groover-Flores wanted to expand the center\u2019s afterschool program in a meaningful way, drawing in new students and offering musical scholarships to those who can\u2019t afford classes at the center. A drumline seemed like a good fit. She brought in three Berklee students as coaches and began recruiting youth to try out. She benefitted from a pipeline of students who had played at the Charles Street church\u2019s Sunday services. By September, she had about a dozen young people who continue to meet and practice together twice or more a week, often for several hours at a time.Less than six months after its start, the students had one of their first performances at Boston Arts Academy as part of its MLK Day celebration.The drumline has become a second family for Amari Ruffin-Lacy, who is just 12 years old and plays a bass drum that\u2019s almost as big as him. \u201cMy mom says I been playing the drums since I was in her belly,\u201d he said.As a preschooler, his mom brought him to Guitar City to play drums while she\u2019d sing. More recently, a grade-school teacher also noticed his love of drumming and won a grant to buy him his first drum kit.\u201cI\u2019ll never forget that drum set,\u201d Ruffin-Lacy said.On that recent cold and cloudy winter evening in Boston, the drumline members gathered in the basement of the Roxbury music center. Aunaxe, one of the drumline leaders, directed the practice. A college student studying biochemistry at Curry College, he\u2019s been playing drums in church since he was in second grade at the Charles Street church.\u201cI love music more than ... more than anything,\u201d Aunaxe said. \u201cI want us to grow. I want people to see us, I want people to know who we are.\u201dAs the group practices the New Orleans Second Line classic, \u201cDo Whatcha Wanna,\u201d the group wordlessly understands their roles and riffs. At one point, tenor drummer Marvin Ripert makes his quint set echo the sound of steel drums from the Caribbean.Groover-Flores said the group intentionally incorporates Afro-Latin sounds as a nod to Boston\u2019s large international population spanning the African diaspora. Aunaxe said that allows the Hamilton-Garrett drumline to produce a unique sound. One that he wants his hometown of Boston to hear.",

        "body": "Recently I spent the better part of two days in conversation with the fraud alert team at my bank. My debit card expired, and I was slow to update the information about the new card at all the various places where it\u2019s registered. I knew the old card was expired; I had cut it up for extra security. I was merrily attempting to make my purchases online and in person using the new debit card with the new expiration date. But it was denied and kept being denied. Since the old card was designated as the default payment, I was racking up a bunch of bouncebacks \u2014 denials \u2014 on attempted purchases which triggered the fraud algorithms. Though I ended up in several rounds of time-consuming conversations, I appreciated the assertive vigilance of the fraud team\u2019s multiple-step verification process. And it turns out that being forced to navigate the process proved to be revealing in another way.Reviewing the attempted charges with the fraud team, I discovered most of the denied purchases were subscriptions. My seemingly endless list of subscriptions \u2014to everything from artisan cosmetic products to niche newsletters, to small household products, to a number of others allowing certain websites\u2019 content. The fraud alerts shut down the automatic billings until I could verify the charges giving me a fresh look at my weekly, monthly, bi-monthly and yearly subscriptions. Many of these subscriptions I had forgotten about or were impulse purchases that didn\u2019t make any sense beyond the moment. Seriously, why do I have a subscription for a weekly specialty drink, when I rarely sip anything but water and coffee? Because in order to sample ONE of the specialty sips, I had to sign up for the free trial. I got distracted, missed the end of the free trial and here I am months later paying regularly for that singular sip. I haven\u2019t even been back to the store to sample another! Of course, it\u2019s my fault. Savvy marketers know just how to entice consumers like me into subscribing because they also know we will likely fail to pay attention to the details. And when you do pay attention, they don\u2019t make it easy for you to unsubscribe.Truly, nobody has time or energy for the inevitable consumer tug-of-war best described by Michael Corleone\u2019s iconic line from the Godfather Part 3 movie: \u201cJust when I thought I was out, they pulled me back in.\u201d The Federal Trade Commission, charged with enforcing consumer protection against fraud, deception, and unfair practices, has heard from thousands about the problem. The Commission\u2019s recent proposal would require businesses to alert consumers that their subscriptions are about to renew, and to stop companies from making special offers coupled with high pressure tactics to make you keep the subscription. The so-called \u201cclick to cancel\u201d proposal would make it as easy to unsubscribe as it is to subscribe. The agency is soliciting public comment on the proposal. Let the FTC know we want out when we want out \u2014 and not when businesses say so. In the meantime, you can spot me at the drink counter trying to get my money\u2019s worth.",

        "body": "50 years ago, direct U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War officially ended as the last remaining combat troops and prisoners of war returned to American soil.It was a complex moment for the country, as the war was deeply unpopular and ended in defeat. More than 58,000 Americans died in the war, along with three million Vietnamese. Fredrik Logevall told Under the Radar that Americans were ready for the war to be over. \"I think they felt on some level, many of them, conflicted,\" he said. \"They wanted these deaths to be justified, for this to matter.\"After the Paris Peace Accords were signed on January 27th, 1973, American POWs were sent home in February and March. \u201cThe prettiest thing I ever saw was when I looked out the window and saw the Golden Gate,\" one POW told KPIX in 1973, shortly after walking off the plane at an Air Force Base in California. \"I want you all to remember that we walked out of Hanoi as winners. We\u2019re not walking with our tail between our legs. We return with honor.\u201dBut the horrors of war can be hard to forget. Tim Sullivan spent about five years at the \"Hanoi Hilton,\" an infamous Vietnamese prison, and described to Under the Radar what happened soon after his plane was shot down.\"I ended up being interrogated right after I got there and went through probably three or four hours of basic interrogation,\" he said. \"They were doing the, 'I'll ask you a question, you give me an answer, if I don't like it, I'll smack you until I get the answer I like.'\"Now, a half century after Operation Homecoming, the prisoner experience at the \"Hanoi Hilton\" is recreated in a new Massachusetts exhibit. \"The cells that we have are actual cells that came from the 'Hanoi Hilton' in Vietnam,\" said Rob Collings, president of the American Heritage Museum. \"So when you walk into them you're getting the feeling of what it was like to be in these cells, and one of the most powerful torture techniques is actually isolation.

Upwards of 1,500 people, including Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, signed a letter asking for a six-month pause on all AI development. Danielle Allen, professor and director of the Edmond & Lily Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard University, was among the signatories.She said on Greater Boston that AI is starting to perform at such a high level, layoffs could be expected in the tech sector. Allen added another concern, that AI can be used to impersonate anyone with a digital footprint. \"We are already living in a world that is drowning in misinformation, it's about to get worse. That's the really scary thing,\" Allen said.Allen said it's time for governments to step up for a global convention and establish a pause.

        "body": "Massachusetts officials unveiled a new initiative Thursday to make it easier for people returning from state prisons to obtain a state-issued ID \u2014 considered a critical first step for successful reentry after incarceration.Under the new agreement signed last fall, the Registry of Motor Vehicles and the Department of Correction pledged to coordinate information on inmates coming up for release so that they can be issued a state ID by the time they leave prison. Under the agreement, the RMV will have a mobile work unit that can travel to correctional facilities to help process the IDs.At a roundtable celebrating the agreement Thursday, Department of Correction Commissioner Carol Mici said that since the deal was reached, the two departments have been implementing changes and she has already seen an increasing number of people with IDs upon release. \u201cFifty percent of [eligible] people released in the last two months have received an ID,\u201d she said, which is about 15-20% higher than the same period last year. Jamal Gooding, a formerly incarcerated person who founded and runs an organization in Brockton called People Affecting Community Change said an ID is critical for nearly every facet of daily life \u2014 banking, job applications, medical care, even housing in a shelter.\u201cA guy coming home tomorrow that doesn't have an ID is the biggest public health issue,\u201d Gooding said. \u201cBecause if you can't get any money \u2026 they are liable to go and rob, steal or beg.\u201d Gooding said he and other community groups, working with the Greater Boston Interfaith Organization, have been pushing for months for the Correction and Transportation departments to figure out a way to make it easier for people to obtain a state ID before they walk out of prison. State Sen. James Eldridge told GBH News he has been lobbying the agencies to make these changes for nearly a decade.\u201cTo guarantee that every incarcerated person upon release gets a state ID, that should not have taken nine years, but it did because of bureaucracy, because of that cultural opposition towards supporting incarcerated people,\u201d Eldridge said. Eldridge said he hopes more changes to the state\u2019s corrections system move faster under the Healey administration than they did under former Gov. Charlie Baker.Since 2018, Massachusetts has increased the requirements for a person to prove their identity in order to get a state-issued ID or driver\u2019s license. Applicants are required to provide proof of citizenship or lawful presence, a Social Security number, and Massachusetts residency \u2014 usually with a recent utility bill or other official mail sent to their Massachusetts address.People who have been incarcerated may not have access to any of those documents \u2014 but the Department of Correction certainly knows and has confirmed the identities of the people they are holding, Gooding points out. The agreement between the two agencies thus far only applies to people who had state-issued IDs before their incarceration, so the Registry of Motor Vehicles has their records on file.Getting these two agencies to cooperate to provide IDs to people about to leave prison is a huge first step, Gooding said. But he also noted the agreement \u201cdoes not go far enough because it does not touch every returning citizen. It is only applicable to those who have already had a Mass. ID or a permit or a license. If you never had any one of those, then you are not already in the Registry's system. And so now we got to figure out how we address this?\u201dAndrew Peck, the state\u2019s Undersecretary of Public Safety for Criminal Justice, said the two agencies plan to continue to expand the system with the hope of reaching some of the inmates in the categories Gooding highlighted.\u201cThis is a public safety issue,\u201d Peck said. \u201cThis is really about setting the foundation\u2026 We should help people and put them on that path to success.\u201dRoberto Rivera, who has been out of prison for four months, told state correctional officials Tuesday that starting his life again without any identification card was daunting.\u201cSo I came home. I don't even got an ID [like] I don't even exist. What am I going to do? I can't get a job, I can't drive, I can't do nothing,\u201d Rivera, 43, said during a roundtable discussion about reentry at the Boston Pre-Release Center in Roslindale.Rivera, who served time for dealing drugs, said that being without an ID made him think about returning to crime to sustain himself.The state Department of Corrections data dashboard indicates that the state completed about 1,800 criminal releases in 2021 \u2014 although it is possible some individuals were released more than once.The memorandum does not apply to county jails that are run by sheriffs\u2019 but funded by state taxpayers. Those jails released nearly 4,000 men and women to communities in Massachusetts in 2022, according to the latest state data.Makeeba McCreary, president of New Commonwealth Racial Equity and Social Justice Fund, said that several organizations her fund is working with as part of its prison reform initiative had raised IDs as a critical need.\u201cThey all rallied around this one issue that really stops any of the audience that they're serving from being able to access all the things that come next, which is housing, employment, health care, you know, you name it,\u201d McCreary said. \u201cApparently you can't do it if you don't have a piece of plastic with your face and name on it.\"",

        "body": "A nearly $400 million spending bill is now on Gov. Maura Healey\u2019s desk after unanimous votes in the state House and Senate Thursday. The bill is meant to bolster food security efforts and help the state\u2019s emergency shelter system respond to an ongoing surge in demand.Sen. Michael Rodrigues, the Senate\u2019s budget chief, said the bill spends $388 million on \u201ctime-sensitive, urgent\" needs. That includes $85 million to expand capacity at emergency family shelters and $65 million to ensure the state\u2019s universal free school meals program can keep operating through the rest of the academic year. When Healey filed an initial version of the bill almost two months ago, she wrote in a message to lawmakers that emergency temporary shelters were at capacity amid heightened demand from families experiencing homelessness, and asked them to pass the bill \"promptly to ensure that we continue to have capacity to shelter all eligible families.\" While lawmakers worked on the bill Thursday, Healey was in the Merrimack Valley to tout her free school meals and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program funding proposals with stops at a Billerica elementary school and Lowell food pantry.The federal government had provided households receiving food assistance with additional SNAP benefits earlier in the pandemic. That expansion ended three weeks ago, leaving about 640,000 Massachusetts households with an average $150 less to spend each month.Healey proposed and lawmakers agreed to $130 million to soften the impact of that change. In what Rodrigues referred to as a \u201cramp-down,\u201d the state will provide SNAP recipients with 40% of the previous enhanced federal allotment for three months. The state's Department of Transitional Assistance has flagged an uptick in scams where thieves attach skimming devices to card readers to steal people\u2019s public benefits. The bill responds to that by allocating $2 million to reimburse people whose SNAP benefits have been stolen. Acting DTA commissioner Mary Sheehan told lawmakers earlier this week that there is \"nothing more maddening to me than somebody stealing benefits from the people that need it the most.\u201d Along with the $388 million in direct spending, the bill authorizes $740 million in state borrowing to support local infrastructure grants, the Clean Water Trust Fund, broadband improvements and other initiatives. Healey gets 10 days to decide whether to sign the bill, veto any of its components, or send it back to the Legislature with any suggested amendments. The bill would also: Extend the pandemic-era authorization for restaurants to offer cocktails, beer and wine to-go with takeout orders another year, until April 1, 2024.Give the special commission reevaluating the state\u2019s seal and motto a new deadline of Nov. 15, 2023, to complete its work. The commission has received several extensions since its original October 2021 due date.Dedicate $1 million to \"a public awareness campaign to educate providers and the public about crisis pregnancy centers and pregnancy resource centers and the centers' lack of medical services.\" The campaign would also \"include information on the availability of providers across the commonwealth that provide legitimate medical and family planning services.\"Steer $2 million to the Boston branch of the NAACP to support programming at its upcoming national convention, and make sure local residents have access to those programs. The convention kicks off July 26.",

        "body": "The temperature may not feel like it, but Opening Day at Fenway Park means spring has officially returned to Boston.Bundled up in a winter coat before Thursday's game at Fenway Park, Tammy Braz of Simsbury, Connecticut summed up how she was feeling.\"Cold!\" she said with a laugh. \"Cold but excited. And I hope we get a win today.\"In the end, she didn't get her wish. The Sox lost to the Baltimore Orioles 10-9, in an opener that was much closer in the end than appeared likely throughout much of the game.Before the game, Braz's husband, Tony, said after last year's last-place finish in the American League East, he's not feeling too optimistic about this season.\"I've been a fan since 1967, so I'm used to good years and bad years,\" he said. \"So, just hope for the best every year.\" As the weather warms up in the coming days and months, Sox fans are hoping their team heats up, too.\"It's going to be a little tough, but I think we'll be all right,\" said Novar Whitworth of Dedham, who comes to Opening Day every year with a group of college friends. \"We're always coming with a 'go' attitude, so we'll see how things go.\"His friend James Sullivan of Westborough was thinking about the Sox' chief baseball officer as this season gets started.\"Hoping for Chaim Bloom's sake that team get some wins this year,\" Sullivan said. \"I think he's on the hot seat for sure.\" In addition to new rules intended to speed up the game, there are a number of new faces on the team this year that Bloom is hoping will energize the Red Sox. Those include left fielder Masataka Yoshida, who was signed from his home team in Japan.After the shock of losing All-Star shortstop Xander Bogaerts to the San Diego Padres this season, the Sox signed a record deal to keep star third baseman Rafael Devers.\"It's just a lot of hope,\" said Kim Hearst of North Attleboro. \"I'm not so sure that keeping Raffi [Devers] was all we were going to need to do, but let's hope that keeping Raffi brings enough spark to the team so that we can enjoy the year.\"\"I'm not expecting a playoff run from this team,\" said Hearst's husband, Hal. \"But I'm expecting a lot of good baseball, a fun team to watch. And it's going to be a fun year.\" The Red Sox finished last season with a record of 78 wins and 84 losses. The previous year they made a surprise run into the post-season, ultimately losing the American League Championship Series 4-2 to the Houston Astros.\"I don't know,\" Parker Silva of Attleboro said of the team's chances. \"They've lost a lot of talent. They've picked up some. I'm hoping for [the Sox to] go back to the playoffs again. But, we'll see. It's a long season. Everybody stays healthy, you never know what could happen. You know?\"New Sox starting pitcher Corey Kluber gave up a home run on just the second batter of the season and the Orioles were up 10-4 by the top of the 8th inning. But before the sold-out Fenway crowd could give in to despair, the Sox battled back, scoring five runs in the last two innings and bringing the game within one bat stroke of a win. Ultimately, a ninth-inning strikeout by Adam Duvall in his first game with the Sox brought the team's rally and hopes of an Opening Day win to an abrupt end.\"It's always disappointing,\" Sox manager Alex Cora said to the press after the game. \"You always want to win that first one. We'll try again next year.\"Sox fan Mike O'Neil of Rockland had mixed feelings on this lineup's debut performance.\"It was sloppy, but I'm OK with that,\" O'Neil said. \"I wish that we spent more money, and I saw that on the field today. But at the end of the day, I was OK with the product.\"The team's leadership needs to be more willing to invest in big players, O'Neil said.\"I think that this is a team that likes to compete. And that's what we've done the last five, six years is we have underdog teams that want to prove they're not underdogs,\" O'Neil said. \"But we're the Boston Red Sox and we're not supposed to be underdogs. We're supposed to be top dogs.\"",

        "body": "Top House Democrats plan to unveil and debate a \"comprehensive\" tax relief package in the next few weeks designed to make Massachusetts more affordable for its residents and \"more competitive with other states,\" according to Speaker Ronald Mariano, who pledged Thursday to deliver relief to people across the income spectrum.Mariano, who in recent months sounded a more cautious tone about whether the state could afford tax relief, said he expects the forthcoming bill to revive several measures lawmakers embraced and then spiked last term as well as some kind of increase to the estate tax threshold.He forecast the House's tax relief proposal will emerge \"just before\" the House Ways and Means Committee in April releases its fiscal year 2024 budget bill, which will also feature funding for universal school meals and a free community college program.The speaker's announcement, delivered in a speech to business leaders at a Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce event, tees up a new round of legislative debate on a topic from which lawmakers retreated last year.\"The House will soon release a comprehensive tax reform package aimed at providing responsible, permanent financial relief to all residents of the commonwealth, regardless of income status,\" Mariano told a crowd of business leaders.Several of the tax code changes in the pending legislation would be phased in over a multi-year period to ensure that they do not \"jeopardize the long-term financial security of the commonwealth,\" Mariano said, offering few details about what will be in the bill.Mariano said after his speech that all of the measures lawmakers initially approved last year \"will be considered again.\" In a question-and-answer session with chamber president Jim Rooney, Mariano said of reforms to the estate tax, \"It's pretty much assumed you're going to see that in the package.\" And asked by reporters if the House's bill would propose slashing the short-term capital gains tax \u2014 a Gov. Maura Healey-endorsed measure that both branches left out of last session's ultimately doomed bill \u2014 Mariano replied, \"Everything's on the table.\"The Quincy Democrat said he wants the bottom line to \"come in at a meaningful number,\" but added that discussions are still taking place about both the overall package size and the scope of each individual form of relief.\"We're still putting all the pieces together. This is, you know, four or five or six moving pieces, so we're trying to get something that's fair and balanced,\" he said.After Democrats pushed through a new surtax on wealthier residents expected to general more than a billion dollars a year in new revenue, tax increases do not appear likely to feature in the bill.\"After riding the [American Rescue Plan Act] high, I don't want to be talking about raising taxes. It's not something that any of us, especially sitting at table 11, are interested in,\" Mariano said, referring to the table where his core leadership team was seated for the Chamber event.Mariano also gave a glimpse at two highlights of the upcoming House budget bill: it will include funding to make permanent a pandemic-era universal school meals program originally launched with federal dollars, and it will embrace a Healey proposal to make community college free for Bay Staters older than 25 who do not have a college degree.He told reporters the price tag for the community college measure, which Healey dubbed \"MassReconnect,\" might be more than the $20 million the governor sought for the program. Pressed by Rep. Natalie Higgins at a hearing this month, Healey administration officials did not have an estimate of the unmet financial need of Bay Staters eligible for the proposed program.Debate about permanent tax relief featured prominently last session, and both branches approved a set of changes to the rental deduction, senior circuit breaker, child and dependent tax credit, estate tax and earned income tax credit (EITC) collectively worth more than $500 million per year.But after learning in the summer that state government owed taxpayers nearly $3 billion in rebates under a decades-old law, House and Senate Democrats put their proposal on ice and then ultimately backed away entirely.Mariano said Thursday that \"countless informative conversations\" and the annual consensus revenue process led to his decision to make another pass. At one point, he joked that House Ways and Means Committee Chair Rep. Aaron Michlewitz and Revenue Committee Co-chair Rep. Mark Cusack deserved \"hazardous pay\" for wading through public input about tax relief.\"I think Chairman Cusack had about five hours of public input the other day,\" Mariano said, referencing Tuesday's Revenue Committee hearing about Healey's nearly $1 billion tax relief bill and many others.Healey's bill calls for a new $600-per-dependent tax credit for parents and caregivers, expansions to the rental deduction and senior circuit breaker credit, a threefold increase in the estate tax threshold to $3 million, and a reduction of the short-term capital gains tax rate from 12 percent to 5 percent.\"The balance is just based on the numbers. If I can get the numbers where I want them, then that's the balance,\" Mariano said. \"You gotta remember, I have to get the votes, so that's a concern. I have progressive members and I have conservative members, so it has to be something I can get passed.\"Some Democrats have also pushed to change the voter-approved tax cap law, known as Chapter 62F, that prompted last year's rebates, which were paid out in proportion to the amount each taxpayer owed during the year. Mariano said Thursday he is \"considering\" action to overhaul the measure, but hinted that it might not feature in the on-deck tax package.\"I don't know if this is the vehicle to do it, but I think that what happened \u2014 I didn't like the dispersal of the money. I think there were some equity issues involved around that that should be looked at,\" he said. \"But I think it's going to take a little bit of concentrated effort to get it right. I don't want to just do it on the fly and create new, different problems that still have some of the same issues. But it is something I'm going to take a look at.\"",

        "body": "Joseph Fisher, a former Boston Police officer, was arrested in Plymouth Thursday for allegedly entering the U.S. Capitol Building during the Jan. 6 insurrection and assaulting a Capitol Police officer. Fisher is the latest in 22 arrests by the FBI\u2019s Boston office, covering Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Maine, in connection with the Jan. 6 \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally. Five died during or immediately after the 2021 attack, including one Capitol Police officer, and two more officers died by suicide in the days after the attack. The Capitol riots triggered the creation of a bipartisan Congressional committee to investigate the day\u2019s events, including the extent of Donald Trump\u2019s involvement, and ultimately recommended criminal charges for the former president. A visual breakdown, included in court filings submitted by FBI Special Agent Casey Biagiotti, shows Fisher\u2019s apparent movements on Jan. 6: first near the Washington Monument, then to outside the Capitol Building, entering the building and walking through multiple halls. When a group of rioters and a Capitol Police officer got into an altercation, Fisher allegedly hit the officer with a chair. In all, Fisher was allegedly in the Capitol Building for 18 minutes. Another regional FBI office directed the Boston FBI office to Fisher because he was wearing a beanie with several Boston sports logos when he entered the Capitol building, according to court filings. His phone also was later traced to the building on the day of the riots, according to the complaint. The Woke Windows Project, an online database that provides public records about the Boston Police Department, shows that four citizen complaints were made about Fisher between 2002 and 2015. The complaints were unfounded, unsubstantiated or Fisher was exhonorated in each case, the database shows. Two other Boston Police officers were dismissed earlier this month for actions related to the Jan. 6 insurrection. One officer, Joseph Abasciano, acknowledged he had been part of the crowd on Jan. 6 but did not enter the Capitol Building. Another officer, Michael Geary, when an FBI social media account put out a request for information related to the riots, replied \u201crats get bats\u201d \u2014 which he explained as a \u201csatirical jab\u201d in an internal investigation. Both were dismissed, and Abasciano told GBH News he was concerned about his First Amendment rights being violated for his dismissal. More than 1,000 people have been arrested in connection with the Jan. 6 insurrection since it took place more than two years ago.",

        "body": "Two candidates with experience at Salem City Hall emerged as the top winners in the preliminary mayoral election. Dominick Pangallo, a former mayoral chief of staff, and former Salem Mayor Neil Harrington finished Tuesday\u2019s race with a comfortable margin over the three other candidates. Whoever emerges as the winner in the final election on May 16, it\u2019ll be the first time a new mayor is elected in Salem since 2005. Former Mayor Kim Driscoll stepped away from her fifth term when she was sworn in as Massachusetts\u2019 lieutenant governor in January.Pangallo, who served as former Mayor Kim Driscoll\u2019s chief of staff up until January 2022, said he\u2019s thrilled by the outcome of the preliminary election. He collected more than 40% of the vote, the highest among the candidates, according to unofficial results released by the city. \u201cIt\u2019s a pivotal moment for Salem, and I feel strongly that we can\u2019t go backwards,\u201d he told GBH News Wednesday. \u201cWe have a strong foundation to build on and keep moving our city forward as a place that works for everyone.\u201dHarrington, who served as Salem\u2019s mayor from 1990 to 1997, did not respond to GBH News\u2019 requests for comment. He took in nearly a third of the vote, per the unofficial tally, and is running on preserving Salem\u2019s economic future as well as keeping Salem\u2019s Peabody Essex Museum from moving to Boston. Pangallo said some of the top issues facing Salem are affordability and housing. He also wants to smooth the transition with new projects coming to the city, making sure that the city benefits from the new jobs an in-development offshore wind terminal while managing the project\u2019s impact on surrounding neighborhoods. Former City Councilor Stephen Dibble finished third with 14% of the vote, acting Mayor and Ward 5 City Councilor Robert McCarthy was fourth with 8%, and activist Stacia Kraft came in fifth with just under 3% at 188 votes.Kraft tells GBH News that she \u201cwent into the race with no illusions\u201d and said there are crucial issues that she hopes remain potent for the final election. \u201cWe have nine planned developments for our flood zones and Salem is only eight square miles. And we now are moving towards privatizing the Salem Housing Authority,\u201d she said. \u201cSo giving over our elderly and disabled residents to for-profit corporations, these are two very big issues.\u201dKraft was the only candidate without a political background. Pangallo attributes his win in the preliminary election to a strong field campaign, having knocked on almost 5,000 doors. He said that kind of grassroots effort is what helped him win 11 of the 14 precincts in Salem and he hopes will give him victory in May.\u201cI feel like the results in that preliminary election were a strong indication that our community is one that wants to keep moving forward as a place that's innovative and professionally managed.\u201dCampaign finance reports show both Pangallo and Harrington spent tens of thousands of dollars on the race. Pangallo spent nearly $28,000 since the beginning of November, while Harrington spent nearly $46,000. Both Pangallo and Harrington outspent the other candidates at least four times over.As of the end of February, Pangallo had just over $42,000 cash on hand, closely matched by Harrington\u2019s nearly $41,000.",

        "body": "Nonprofit leaders and local activists in Worcester say the city\u2019s process for awarding federal COVID-19 relief funding to community groups has been inequitable, arguing that a significant chunk of the money is going to large organizations that already have sufficient support.Late last year, the city of Worcester accepted applications from local nonprofits and other organizations for about $10 million in American Rescue Plan Act money, meant to address issues like food insecurity in communities most impacted by the pandemic.City Manager Eric Batista, who\u2019s overseeing all ARPA decisions, previously told GBH News that Worcester\u2019s application review process would prioritize smaller organizations that have struggled in the past to secure grant funding. But although some of the ARPA money recently went to newer groups trying to expand, others were left out \u2014 an exclusion nonprofit leaders worry comes at the expense of the people, often of color, who would benefit from their services. \u201cThis is what the system keeps doing,\u201d said Derrick Kiser, who did not receive any ARPA money for his nonprofit Fresh Start, which provides mental health counseling to at-risk youth and young adults. \u201cThe same system continues to feed the same organizations and the same people.\u201dAccording to a GBH News review of publicly available tax data, more than 60% of the total $11.7 million in ARPA money for projects and programming was awarded to larger, more established organizations with at least $400,000 in annual funding.In an interview, Batista argued the city carefully considered all of the 140 applications and awarded the money fairly to a diverse array of groups. He said organizations that didn\u2019t receive any funding will have opportunities in the future to secure city grants.Worcester received $146 million in ARPA funds in 2021. Then-City Manager Edward Augustus appointed residents to committees that would review applications for some of the funding. At the urging of local activists, the city held multiple rounds of community outreach to seek feedback on how to make the awarding process fair and equitable, then hosted workshops to walk prospective applicants through the process. When Kiser applied in the fall last year, he saw the ARPA money as an opportunity to expand his nonprofit Fresh Start, which has served more than 300 people since its founding in 2018. Kiser has used his experience as a former Worcester gang leader to help formerly incarcerated people assimilate back into society and sway youth to leave gangs. But his annual budget has usually been no more than $150,000, which makes it hard for him to broaden his reach. With the help of the Seven Hills Foundation, Kiser filled out three separate lengthy applications for the ARPA money to help fund different programs at his nonprofit. Each application was for $250,000, the maximum organizations could request for a programming initiative. Although he\u2019s struggled in the past to secure other city grants, Kiser said city officials had told him Fresh Start was the exact type of nonprofit they\u2019d prioritize for pandemic relief money.\u201cWe would use that money getting two case managers to help assist [clients], provide them with life skills, communication skills, financial literacy ... de-escalation skills,\u201d Kiser said. \u201cAnd then literally transportation,\u201d bringing them to jobs.But the city rejected all of his applications with no explanation why.Charles Luster also was hopeful. His organization, 2Gether We Eat, employs hydroponic farming to provide fresh produce to lower-income families across the Worcester area. But Luster said although the Worcester Regional Chamber of Commerce completed his application for him, he was also denied funding.So was Dan Ford, whose nonprofit trains homeless and other underprivileged young people how to restore cars so they can pursue that work as a stable career. Ford previously tried to convert a vacant Worcester manufacturing building into a youth community and vocational hub, known as The Bridge. But after Ford lost out on a bid to purchase the building, he settled on a new plan to expand his auto repair shop into a job training center with apartments for homeless youth.\u201cI know what it is to sleep in an alleyway overnight, freezing cold with a leather jacket and some jeans on,\u201d said Ford, who spent about a decade in out and out homelessness while growing up in Worcester.He thought the ARPA funding could help jumpstart his project, so he hired an experienced grant writer to help him apply. He said he was disappointed but not surprised when he received his rejection letter from Worcester in February.\u201cIt\u2019s business as usual for [the] city of Worcester. ... It\u2019s a slap in the face,\u201d Ford said. \u201cIt\u2019s pure neglect of a community.\u201d Nelly Medina, a local community organizer who founded the social justice nonprofit Free Worcester, said the ARPA funding decisions exemplify the city\u2019s favoritism of deep-pocketed organizations over small, younger ones often led by people of color. Medina believes Worcester\u2019s marginalized residents lose out when the smaller organizations representing them aren\u2019t given a chance. \u201cThe grassroots efforts that are coming from the people on the ground are the ones that are scoffed at,\u201d said Medina, whose group did not apply for ARPA funding. \u201cThese organizations that were looked over are some of the most respected in the community. ... It\u2019s a huge injustice.\u201dIn a February memo to City Council, Worcester City Manager Eric Batista said his administration received over 140 applications requesting more than a combined $40 million in funding, far more than what was allotable. In response, Batista said he slightly increased the ARPA money available for the applicants \u201cto provide additional funding in support of these critical projects and programs.\u201dStill, considering the high demand for the money, nonprofit leaders and activists question why so much of it went to larger organizations with deep budgets. For example, UMass Chan Medical School has received hundreds of millions of dollars in donations and research funding in recent years but was awarded $225,000 in ARPA money for its Lifeline for Kids program, which helps children recover from trauma.And Worcester Community Action Council, which works to address poverty across the region, received the maximum $250,000 in ARPA programming money even though the organization secured more than $40 million in total funding in 2022.Worcester Community Action Council Executive Director Marybeth Campbell told GBH News she agrees with people\u2019s frustration about the ARPA decisions. In fact, she considered not applying for the money because her organization already benefits from being large and well-established. However, she ended up submitting an application to use the ARPA money for a universal basic income pilot program, in which 50 families will receive direct cash payments for a few years.Officials at UMass Chan deferred to the city for comments about the ARPA funding decisions. Batista and Worcester Chief Development Officer Peter Dunn said the ARPA review committee appropriately accounted for the size and background of applicants. They added the city tried to award organizations the amount of money they asked for, as long as it didn\u2019t significantly exceed their current budgets.\u201cLet\u2019s say if the organization has an annual budget of $50,000 and they request $250,000, then maybe that impacted them in terms of the realisticness of being able to accomplish that and manage that amount of money,\u201d Dunn said.Activists and nonprofit leaders said these doubts about smaller organizations\u2019 ability to manage grant funding are typical among Worcester officials and the greater philanthropic community.But the ARPA money is meant to be used creatively and has more flexible requirements, said Ben Wood, a senior director with Boston-based Health Resources in Action, which works to make philanthropy more fair. He noted that if the city had doubts about some applicants\u2019 capacity to manage money, it could have hired a consultant to help them.Instead, Wood and activists said Worcester\u2019s consideration of the size of applicants\u2019 budgets could have resulted in larger organizations with deeper pockets automatically qualifying for more money over smaller nonprofits. Some city councilors agreed Worcester officials didn\u2019t take advantage of an opportunity to use the ARPA money for organizations that usually struggle to receive funding.\u201cThe process wasn\u2019t set up to be equitable,\u201d City Councilor Etel Haxhiaj said. \u201cIt creates a mistrust between community and our local government.\u201dShe and Councilor Khrystian King said city officials\u2019 next step should be to review and analyze the ARPA decision-making process to avoid the same pattern with future grant money. Haxhiaj added the city needs to \u201cremedy some of the hurt and harm that was caused.\u201d",

        "body": "The city of Boston is grieving the loss of Melvin Herbert King, who died yesterday at the age of 94. Mel King was a nationally known civil rights icon, lawmaker and the first Black mayoral candidate to advance to a general election in Boston. King is being remembered now for his work as a longtime community organizer and his lasting effect on the city and state politics by the many who knew him, including GBH News\u2019 senior investigative reporter Phillip Martin, who joined GBH\u2019s Morning Edition hosts Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel to share his memories. This transcript has been lightly edited. Paris Alston: This is a really huge, devastating loss of someone who lived a remarkable life. Phillip, tell us what Mel King represented in the context of Boston history. Phillip Martin: Well, I think everything. I mean, he defined it over a lifetime. I mean, 94 years: activist, community organizer, change-maker. When a lot of people think about Boston, they think about two things, historically speaking. They think about the city that's defined by its revolutionary provenance, you know, the 18th century. And they also think about it as a city defined by the busing of the 1970s. But King sort of represented this arc of 20th- and 21st-century history \u2014 its racial and class intolerance for sure, but also the fight against racism. He represents the city's current multiracial political hierarchy, as opposed to what we've seen in the past. Jeremy Siegel: You used that phrase \u201cthe arc of history,\u201d referencing what King represented as a community activist and as a lawmaker. Tell us a little bit more about the transformation that he was part of in the city of Boston. Martin: Absolutely. People drive every day down Dartmouth Street and they see these apartments called the Tent City Apartments. And I'm not sure how many people think about how that got there, because you're looking at an apartment complex that's a mixed-income housing complex in the heart of Boston, Copley Square, where you actually have low-income people living there. This was the result of a protest that began in the late \u201960s against the Boston Redevelopment Authority, led by Mel King. The intention of the city, the BRA at the time \u2014 the Boston Redevelopment Authority \u2014 was to build this garage. And King led this protest culminating in this dedicated, quality living community, eponymously called Tent City Apartments. That was Mel King! Alston: That was one of the first things I learned when I was learning about Mel King upon moving here.Martin: That's right. This originated from this popular protest against gentrification. You have to think about Mel King, in answer to your question, his 10 years as a state representative elected in 1973, in the midst of extraordinary racial turmoil. And we also have to think about Mel King \u2014 at that time, you had this deep reactionary political leadership in the '70s, represented by people like Louise Day Hicks, a city councilor and former congressperson. And King formed this Rainbow Coalition, a campaign for mayor in 1983 that was sort of an adjacent to what was happening on the national level with Jesse Jackson. And here is an interview with Mel King in 1983. This interview was conducted by reporter Gail Harris, and it's King explaining why he was running for mayor. And this explains it all.[Previously recorded] Mel King: I can remember a time when I went to do an errand and came back with a man following. And it was cold. And he came to the door and I ran in and my father saw him. And the man said that he was hungry and cold, came in and was fed, warmed and given some food on his way. And I'll never forget that. My father said, \u201cNo matter what you have, a little, you always have enough to share.\u201d It's kind of stuck with me all of my life. [Recording ends]Martin: So you have this powerful, very tall, soft-spoken man who was just absolutely compassionate. And as another example, final example of this: When I was working with Oxfam America, and at this time it was located in the Bay Village, Mel King worked with us on outreach programs, not just to the city, but to Haiti, Nicaragua and Southern Africa in the 1980s. Alston: So many milestones throughout his life there, Phillip. And, you know, another thing that I would hear about Mel King was was how much community organizing was part of just who he was as a person, his everyday life. He was in the streets during protests. He was in the State House legislating, but he was also welcoming people into his own house to organize and to talk about the issues of the day. So tell us a little bit about those famous Sunday brunches he would have in the South End. Martin: Oh, yeah. Besides the good food, I think everyone listening who's been to Mel King's house knows exactly what I'm talking about. You had food, you had laughs, but you also had serious discussion. People would strategize about, for example, in the '80s, about Boston's anti-apartheid movement to improve the position of Black and brown workers in the city. He would have people at the house from from organizations like the Chinese Progressive Association. He also represented the community at MIT. He ran this Community Fellows program. He was this true coalition builder, coalitions that stretched across racial lines. Many activists can say they are the children, if you will, of Mel King. As I said, he was close to Jesse Jackson, whose own Rainbow Coalition actually echoed Mel King's on a national level in terms of successful coalition-building. That's what I can say about him. Siegel: And real quickly, before we let you go, Phillip, what legacy does Mel King leave behind? Martin: In many ways, he's leaving a lot behind. But he's also pushing a lot of things forward, even his 1983 book. It has been basically re-formed to reflect the times. And that was at the insistence of young activists in this area. He also left behind these legacy at the at the South End Settlements \u2014 the South End Technology Center, for example, which he started in 1997. But most importantly, his six children and his wife, Joyce, are a beautiful family. They welcomed you into their home. And we will miss you, Mel King.",

        "body": "Updated March 28 at 10:21 p.m.Melvin King, a longtime community advocate, state legislator, and Boston\u2019s first Black mayoral candidate to advance to a general election, has died at age 94.His son Michael King confirmed Mel King\u2019s death to GBH News Tuesday evening.\u201cHe spoke truth to power, and he was pretty much beyond \u2014 above \u2014 reproach,\u201d Michael King said. \u201cThat\u2019s the openness and the example that he was trying to set. \u2018It\u2019s not that hard to do the right thing,\u2019 is something that he would say.\u201dFor the past half-century, King has been one of the city\u2019s most well-known advocates for local communities of color. In politics, his endorsement was highly sought after by candidates seeking credibility with Boston\u2019s Black community.King was born in Boston\u2019s South End neighborhood, which in the mid-20th century represented the heart of the city\u2019s Black population. He graduated from what is now the John D. O\u2019Bryant School of Mathematics and Science, then-Boston Tech. King was first elected to public office in 1973 to the state Legislature representing Suffolk County. He lost to Ray Flynn in the 1983 mayoral election. That run in 1983 would end up inspiring people like Tito Jackson, who ran for the office in 2017. He said he remembers being 8 years old, seeing a large Black man \u2014 in every sense of that word \u2014 speaking the truth. He said the Mel King way of organizing a coalition, across race and income, informed his own run. \u201cAs sad of a moment as this is, it also means that Mel King lived an impactful life that touched the lives of tens of thousands \u2014 and maybe hundreds of thousands \u2014 of people,\u201d Jackson said. State Sen. Lydia Edwards, a frequent visitor to King\u2019s Sunday brunches, said his passing marks the end of the city\u2019s radically loving activists.\u201cI\u2019m really sad because we don\u2019t have any more Mels, not even a pipeline for Mels at all,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was a universal uniter, above the geographic division, above class division, race \u2014 he was the one all organizers could look to and know his heart was the purest.\u201dKing endorsed Edwards during her first, unsuccessful run for state Senate in 2016.For Boston City Councilor Kendra Lara, King guided her political organizing from a young age. As a state Representative, he helped the People Before Highways movement, a movement that put a stop to government attempts to extend the I-95 through Roxbury. Residents\u2019 fierce pushback put 2,000 protesters on the street in 1969, which halted the development and ultimately led to the Orange Line being brought into those neighborhoods instead. \u201cWhen I learned that story \u2014 when I was in the sixth grade \u2014 is when I realized that people who looked like me and the people in my neighborhood had power. That if we could stop a 10-lane highway from cutting through our neighborhood, that there was absolutely nothing that we couldn\u2019t do,\u201d said Lara, who now represents Jamaica Plain and West Roxbury. \u201cAnd Mel King is a part of that legacy.\u201cWhen I think about my community, it exists in the way it does because of him,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd when I think about my generation of organizers \u2014 and when I think about the generation of Black and brown young people who grew up in movements, who grew up fighting to make sure that their community had a voice and power in what our neighborhoods looked like \u2014 it is because people like Mel King set the standard.\u201d\u201cFor decades, Mel King taught us all how to serve, how to build, and how to love,\u201d Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said in a statement Tuesday night. \u201cOn behalf of the City of Boston, we send our deepest condolences to the King family and the many, many loved ones, mentees, and friends of Mel. With gratitude and determination to keep fighting, Rest in Power.\u201d\u201cMel King is an iconic figure for Boston, not just in the Black community, but Boston overall because he knew how to bring people together,\u201d said Bishop William E. Dickerson II, a friend of King\u2019s. \u201cI know that his impact is going to be missed deeply by so many people, so many sectors, of our communities.\u201d Michael King, one of King\u2019s six children, is the director of the South End Technology Center, which the elder King founded in 1997. He says his father was part of the solution that helped pave the way to make Boston's leadership more diverse.\u201cYou know, he was part of the solution to get us to be able to accept that any person who has done their homework and does their homework can reach any point in life,\u201d he said. King said he wanted to honor his father and rejoice in his life.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything to be sad about. We miss him, but that\u2019s the selfish part of us, you know?\u201d said Michael King. \u201cI feel like I was blessed to be, you know \u2014 have a chance to, you know \u2014 be in this time, next to someone who took his journey so seriously.\u201d This story has been updated to include additional comments and information.",

        "body": "The state's governing document still only refers to elected officials by male pronouns. And while the process to change that language would be lengthy, this is the year to start because \"history has blown by the Massachusetts Constitution,\" according to one lawmaker.Voters last November elected the state's first all-women executive team, which followed Lt. Gov. Jane Swift's groundbreaking run as acting governor in the early 2000s, and three other female lieutenant governors dating back to Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy in 1987.\"Perhaps that begs the question, why bother? Clearly, the Constitution's existing language had little impact on the recent electoral fortunes of women. But words matter,\" first-term Rep. Jenny Armini of Marblehead told the Judiciary Committee. \"Language is a signal to the world. It's how we communicate our values. And it's a tool by which citizens learn who, and what, is important.\"While the titles are used infrequently and many people simply refer to Healey as \"governor,\" the Constitution directs people to refer to the governor by the honorific of \"His Excellency,\" and to the lieutenant governor as \"His Honor.\"The governor's title is one piece of Massachusetts' British-colonial past that John Adams apparently considered worth preserving in the modern era when he drafted a new state Constitution in 1780.The Judiciary Committee is weighing two proposed amendments filed by Armini (H 30 / H 31) that would add female and gender-neutral pronouns, like \"Her Excellency\" and \"Their Honor,\" to refer to the state's leaders. Other amendments before the committee would open up the language in the rest of the Constitution so that it does not exclusively use male pronouns.Gov. Maura Healey told reporters Tuesday afternoon that she hadn't heard about the proposals.\"I think people know how to refer to me, they refer to me in a lot of different ways,\" Healey said.The governor also made some light of the 18th century language.\"I guess Abigail didn't have a hand in that,\" said Healey, apparently referring to Abigail Adams, who famously implored her husband John to \"remember the ladies\" in his public policy work.\"Where was she? She wasn't at home that day,\" Healey quipped.After 20 years of male governors, it is probably more out of habit, than by strict adherence to the Constitution, that there's an occasional reference to the governor this year using male pronouns.As the Senate sent its first big bill to Healey's desk this month, Majority Leader Cindy Creem said it would be \"laid before the governor for his approbation.\"An aide stepped up toward the rostrum. \"Her,\" he interjected toward the microphone.Creem often presided over formal sessions during Gov. Charlie Baker's administration, hence a possible slip of the tongue on the routine script.When the presiding senator sends bills to the governor for \"approbation,\" the language mirrors a section of the Constitution about how a governor can \"signify his approbation\" of a bill or resolve by signing it.A separate amendment filed by Sen. Will Brownsberger (S 10) deals more extensively with gender references to the governor and lieutenant governor throughout the Constitution. Brownsberger's proposal would replace other instances of male-only pronouns with \"he or she\" and \"his or her,\" including the section about bill-signings.Armini's proposals are more targeted than Brownsberger's, focusing on the honorific titles, but they also account for more gender possibilities.Explaining inclusion of \"their\" pronouns in her amendments, Armini called for lawmakers to look toward a future day when \"someone unencumbered by gender, or gender assigned at birth, sits in the corner office.\"She referred to Rep. Sam Monta\u00f1o, another first-term House member who uses both female and nonbinary pronouns, as one politician who is \"full of promise.\"First-term Rep. Dawne Shand of Newburyport recalled, as a high school student in Alabama, her teacher saying that male pronouns in government documents were appropriately \"encompassing\" of all.Shand disagreed, as did Rep. Mindy Domb, who spoke in favor of the Armini amendments and her own proposal (H 32) which would replace the word \"he\" with the phrase \"the person\" everywhere it appears in the document.\"'He' is not an inclusive term. 'He' is a gendered term,\" said Domb.The Judiciary Committee has until April 26 to issue positive or negative reports on the various bills it heard Tuesday. Lawmakers then face a May 10 deadline to call up any of those proposals to feature on the Constitutional Convention calendar for this session.No one spoke in opposition to any of the proposals Tuesday, and not all the proposals were addressed \u2014 no one spoke to Brownsberger's, for example.But Domb, an Amherst Democrat, had a thought for would-be critics or those who say the male-dominated text doesn't matter.She said one of her constituents offered that \"if it really doesn't matter\" what pronouns are in there, why not change all the \"he\" references exclusively to \"she.\"\"And we thought about that,\" Domb recalled. \"We thought, well, should we change that?

        "body": "The process that yielded Boston\u2019s latest voting map was both a strategy to protect incumbents and a \u201cracial diluting\u201d of the city\u2019s long-held majority-minority seat in Mattapan, At-Large City Councilor Michael Flaherty testified in federal court Tuesday.His comments came during the opening hearing of the case challenging the legality of the voting map approved by the council and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu last November.Flaherty, who is in his 20th year on the Boston City Council, argued fellow councilors who ultimately approved the map were less experienced with the redistricting process and wrongly focused on racial demographics. \u201cWe\u2019re here today because people disregarded the advice of professional experts,\u201d Flaherty proclaimed, pointing to a memo drafted by Jeffrey Wice, a redistricting expert and adjunct professor at New York Law School. The memo listed key principles for redistricting, including \u201cpopulation equality, minority voting rights, compactness, contiguity and preservation of neighborhoods.\u201d\u201c[The council\u2019s] primary objective,\u201d Flaherty argued, was \u201cpopulation balancing\u201d \u2014 which is basically making sure each district contained an equal number of voters. That goal, he testified, was largely achieved during a September working session. In that session, all councilors except one, Ricardo Arroyo, toyed with voting district boundaries according to newly drawn precincts, the units that compose the city\u2019s nine voting districts. Rather than adhering to the equal population charge, Flaherty said his council colleagues eventually disregarded the changes of that working session and erroneously considered racial demographics as they sought to rearrange the city\u2019s nearly 300 precincts according to the latest U.S. Census figures. \u201cWe didn\u2019t need to do anything else,\u201d he said repeatedly.Toward the end of his three-hour testimony, Flaherty said he feels the council\u2019s \u201crushed\u201d adoption of the map created another vulnerability: it opens up the council to accusations of incumbent protection. The late adoption, he said, would make it very difficult for an aspiring City Council candidate to determine what district they reside in and take the necessary steps to challenge a sitting councilor. Those seeking to run in the upcoming election can begin declaring their intent to run as soon as April 19, a fact that dawned on Judge Patti B. Saris as Flaherty wrapped up.\"I need to have this done by the end of April?\" she asked the attorneys, noting a prior impression of no urgent deadline for the case. Flaherty\u2019s testimony was punctuated by stints of searching for exhibits and murmurs and snickering from onlookers in the audience, mostly from local political advocacy groups who support Boston\u2019s new map. At one point, Judge Saris warned the onlookers to be quiet, or be ejected from the courtroom.Lawyers for the city did not produce a witness, but in opening statements said that the case amounted to a mere political dispute.\u201cThis case is ultimately about choices,\u201d said attorney Jennifer Grace Miller. The final map, she said, made \u201cmodest\u201d changes to the city's last map, was approved through the proper municipal channels and left a contingent of residents unsatisfied.Plaintiffs challenging the city map are scheduled to present more witnesses, including veteran Congressman Stephen Lynch, whose district contains a portion of South Boston. The case is an outgrowth of a state court case brought by a coalition of South Boston residents and community groups who tried to stop the council from approving the map last year. The case was later amended to include the latest arguments, then eventually moved to federal court and revised to include new plaintiffs. Boston saw an explosion of growth in its newly built Seaport neighborhood over the last decade. The area sits within the city\u2019s second voting district, requiring the boundaries to shift and shed population. At the same time, the city\u2019s third district, anchored in Dorchester, needed to pick up voters. Councilor Arroyo, who was stripped of chairmanship of the city\u2019s redistricting committee amid last year\u2019s messy Democratic primary for Suffolk County district attorney, attended Tuesday\u2019s hearing and said his colleague\u2019s testimony illustrated \u201cjust how frivolous the lawsuit actually is.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s very telling that not a single expert is on the witness list for the plaintiffs \u2026 and I think it\u2019s pretty clear at this point that there\u2019s no real law this lawsuit is standing on,\" he said. The case is scheduled to resume Wednesday.",

        "body": "It was summer in Vermont and the sound of cicadas droned through the woods. This insect song was the inspiration Vinh Le needed to open his first restaurant space.\u201cCicada is summer,\u201d Le, the co-owner of Cicada Coffee Bar, told Boston Public Radio at the Boston Public Library on Tuesday. \u201cCicadas remind me about my childhood, about the times I relaxed.\u201d Vinh Le and his life and business partner Duong Huynh, have created a restaurant at 106 Prospect St. that doubles as a community space, where patrons can slow down, connect and share food and drinks in the heart of Cambridge. Ten years ago, Le left Vietnam for the U.S. to attend architecture school at Columbia University. During the pandemic, Le\u2019s life slowed down and he decided he wanted to open a restaurant. But not just any restaurant \u2014 he wanted every aspect of the space to be tailored to the Cambridge community. The funky lighting, the handmade plates and the mid-century modern furniture are all designed with Cambridge tastes in mind. Customers might recognize the mid-century modern chairs from their grandmother\u2019s house, Le said. Once in Cicada\u2019s cozy interior (after braving the line that often stacks up outside the restaurant), people consume locally sourced drinks and food inspired by Le\u2019s home country. Vietnamese food is defined by lots of fresh ingredients and herbs, Le said. The menu includes fresh summer rolls filled with vegetables, sushi rice with salmon and mushrooms, banh mi sandwiches and noodle salad with charred eggplant. The coffee is not to be missed. The sea salt shaker is the signature drink made with coffee, sea salt and condensed milk. All the ingredients are shaken vigorously in a cocktail shaker to create a frothy, milkshake-like beverage. \u201cThis is my performance,\u201d said Le, as he showed off his bartending skills and poured iced coffee for hosts Jim Braude and Margery Eagan.Vietnamese started using condensed milk in their coffee during the Vietnam War, said Le, when they didn\u2019t have access to fresh milk. In addition to sweet caffeine, Cicada serves hot tea brewed with fresh ginger and lemongrass, plus homemade hot sauce. Le's innovation has been recognized, it was announced in January that he is a semifinalist for the Emerging Chef James Beard Award. The short list of James Beard Award nominees will be announced Mar. 29. When asked whether the nomination puts a burden on his shoulders, Le said he wasn\u2019t bothered. He plans to continue cooking and creating community at Cicada no matter what happens. Still, he acknowledged it\u2019s still stressful owning and operating a new restaurant. But this stress leads to hard work and creativity, said Le. To balance the stress Le said he practices living in the moment, whether it is cooking food or picking up a shift for a sick coworker. BPR host Jim Braude asked Le\u2019s partner Huynh, standing just off stage, whether that is true. \u201cHe tries every other moment to live in the moment,\u201d said Huynh, with a laugh.",

        "body": "At the Massachusetts State House on Tuesday morning, community activists and members of the Massachusetts Commission on LGBTQ Youth gathered on the steps in support of trans youth. The rally came ahead of Trans Day of Visibility on March 31, which, in Washington, D.C., will culminate with the March for Queer & Trans Youth Autonomy. It will be the first major queer and trans-led demonstration in the nation\u2019s capital. \u201cWe\u2019re just here to say that we deserve gathering not just on hot June parades, but also on wet March mornings,\u201d said North American Indian Center of Boston civic engagement co\u00f6rdinator Reggi Alkiewicz during their address to the crowd. It was evident that the damp chill of early spring did not temper the enthusiasm radiating from Beacon Street. Commission executive director Shaplaie Brooks emphasized the commonwealth\u2019s legacy of pioneering social initiatives and the necessity that it remain at the vanguard of progressivism: Massachusetts is the first state to have such a commission centered on the wellbeing of LGBTQ youth. But the commission is counted as but one victory, and Brooks was vocal about the need for continuous political engagement. She pointed to the nationwide statistics: 434 bills in U.S. state legislatures target LGBTQ people, according to a tracker from the ACLU. \u201cConsider this the home base for the national march that\u2019s in Washington this Friday,\u201d Brooks exclaimed during her remarks. Even if Massachusetts isn\u2019t one of the several states that has already passed explicitly anti-trans legislation, such sentiment still exists here: a group including apparent neo-Nazis interrupted a drag story hour in Taunton, and Boston Childrens\u2019 Hospital has received multiple bomb threats from harassers over the gender-affirming care the hospital provides. \u201cThanks to MassEquality, we know that in Massachusetts alone, there are 48 districts and counting that have anti-LGBTQ activity,\u201d Brooks said. Commission vice chair Noemi Uribe reiterated that the state should focus on proactive legislation to combat this antagonism: \u201cEven though we don't have legislation or filed bills right now that are anti-LGBTQ or anti-trans, that activity is still something we need to listen to, and we need to call on legislators to pass protections to prevent anything from happening.\u201d Despite the energy at the rally, the event was also an indicator of the remaining work to be done: in the crowd there was a conspicuous lack of Black youth, something that co-chair Craig Martin acknowledged. \u201cOur youth of color don\u2019t always have the spaces where they can feel brave and be public, because they are generally the ones who are most targeted, experience the most violence, and actually seem to be invisible in the very sphere of the community,\u201d he said. \u201cNot having them here means we still have a lot more work to do to create a brave space for them to come out and just be in community.\u201d A part of that work includes the commission\u2019s annual report, due April 27, that provides \u201cevidence-based and community-sourced recommendations\u201d to both the state Legislature and statewide agencies, outlining policies and programs to secure the well-being of LGBTQ youth.",

Public transportation experts on Greater Boston said that comment was a red flag.\"If he only has the resources that he has today he will fail because they're not enough,\" said Jim Aloisi, former Massachusetts transportation secretary. Aloisi said Eng will need a revised collective bargaining agreement, more money from the legislature and a larger staff. \"What we need to do is to focus on what needs to be done in a candid way and we need to ask the governor and the legislature to take action because Phil Eng won't be able to do it on his own, he has no power,\" Aloisi said.Doug Most, author of \"The Race Underground: Boston, New York, and the Incredible Rivalry that Built America\u2019 First Subway,\" agreed with Aloisi. He said the MBTA was \"born broken,\" designed with narrow tunnels and sharp turns that rule out long trains and fast speeds. \"This is something we have to live with. This is what we've got.

        "body": "BOSTON (AP) \u2014 Massachusetts Democratic U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren announced Monday that she will seek a third term in 2024.Warren, a prominent voice for the liberal wing of the Democratic Party and a failed 2020 presidential contender, said she's running for reelection to end corruption in Washington, make the economy work for the middle class and protect democracy.\"I first ran for Senate because I saw how the system is rigged for the rich and powerful and against everyone else. I won because Massachusetts voters know it, too. And now I'm running for Senate again because there's a lot more we've got to do,\" Warren said in a campaign video released Monday.Warren, 73, had more than $2.3 million in her campaign account at the end of 2022, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission.Warren first won election to the seat in 2012, defeating incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Scott Brown, who was elected to fill out the term of Democratic U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, who died in 2009.With the win, the then-Harvard Law School professor became the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts.In 2018, Warren won a second term, easily defeating Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, before quickly setting her sights on the presidency.While popular among some Democratic voters for her blunt rhetoric, Warren was unable to break away from the party's pack of contenders and dropped out after failing to win any of the states that voted on Super Tuesday, including coming in third in the Democratic primary in her home state.During the campaign against Brown and again during her bid for the presidency, Warren was dogged by past claims of Native American heritage and her inability to provide documentation of that ancestry.That led then-President Donald Trump to go after her early in the presidential campaign, derisively labeling her \"Pocahontas.\" Warren had said she learned of her family ties to Cherokee and Delaware tribes from stories told by her parents.After the 2020 loss, Warren continued her focus on the financial sector.Warren recently joined California Rep. Katie Porter, a Democrat, to push a proposal to repeal a 2018 rollback of certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act, enacted after the financial crisis a decade earlier.The bill, part of discussions in Congress following the recent abrupt failure of two banks, is unlikely to advance.In her campaign video, Warren ticked off a series of priorities from passing a wealth tax and putting stricter rules on banks to making child care more affordable, protecting coastal communities and building what she called \"a 21st century transportation system across all of Massachusetts.\"It's unclear who might challenge Warren for the Senate seat. Many Democrats appeared to be waiting until Warren or fellow Massachusetts U.S. Sen. Edward Markey, also a Democrat, decided not to seek reelection. Markey in 2020 fended off a primary challenge from then-Democratic U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy.The state's Republican Party is trying to rebuild after losing the governor's office last year when Republican Gov. Charlie Baker opted not to seek a third term and Democrat Maura Healey handily defeated GOP candidate Geoff Diehl.Warren already has the backing of many high-profile Massachusetts Democrats including U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu and Markey.Warren serves on several congressional committees including the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Armed Services.",

        "body": "Updated March 28 at 4:39 p.m.Wasn\u2019t it just yesterday that tick tock was simply a reference to time? As in the ticking sound an analog watch makes while the seconds and minutes pass. Or as shorthand for \"hurry up.\" Like when my college dean was unmoved by my \u2014 I thought \u2014 heartfelt pleas for a pass/fail grade for one of my classes. Dean Maude Chaplin said no to my theatrics and then added for emphasis, \u201cTick tock. You need to get to the library.\u201d I did, in case you were wondering. In the various broadcast newsrooms where I have worked, tick tock was shorthand for the timeline of an event. Somebody was always yelling \u2018\u2019Where\u2019s the tick tock on the hearings?\u201dThe old-fashioned analog clock may be ticking down for the digital phenomenon TikTok, a short video hosting service owned by the Chinese company ByteDance. It\u2019s taken the world by storm, a favorite app for about 20% of the world\u2019s internet users. At 1 billion \u2014 with a \u201cb\u201d \u2014 active users spread across 154 countries, TikTok\u2019s siren song of dance challenges, how-to demonstrations, cooking tutorials, and more is an ever-changing landscape. Some months ago, I explained how the platform\u2019s proprietary design precisely customizes content based on each user\u2019s prior viewing habits. Americans love their TikTok, but a recent Quinnipiac University Poll revealed 49% favored a ban. Quinnipiac\u2019s polling analyst Dr. Tim Malloy concluded most Americans \u201cwould like to click delete and send TikTok to the dustbin of social media history.\u201d Perhaps, but as the results showed, the largest group of TikTok users \u2014 the 18- to 34-year-olds \u2014 don't want the ban.But the drumbeat for shutting down the app gained momentum after the White House issued an order to all federal agencies to delete it from government devices. Canada followed suit with its own TikTok ban, as did New Zealand and Britain. And now the Biden administration has upped the ante threatening an outright ban of TikTok if the Chinese-owned company isn\u2019t sold. Last week TikTok\u2019s top executive Shou Zi Chew endured a bipartisan verbal pummeling from an openly skeptical, sometimes hostile, congressional committee warning of the danger of the app\u2019s influence on young people and its ability to collect Americans\u2019 personal information. During his five hours of testimony, Chew insisted TikTok operated independently from the Chinese government. He emphasized the plan for a Texas-based firewall to protect American data. Minnesota Democrat Angie Craig bluntly told Chew, \u201cProject Texas just doesn\u2019t pass the smell test.\u201dI\u2019m fascinated by the too-late handwringing about TikTok \u2014 at this point equivalent to closing the barn door after the horses have escaped. Unless there is some solid evidence that TikTok is indeed a political and military threat, all of this Sturm und Drang has no actual point. And I\u2019ll note that Shou Chew recently revealed he doesn\u2019t allow his children to use the app. He points out that TikTok does not allow kids younger than 13 to use TikTok, except in America. I\u2019d be surprised if his children hadn\u2019t already figured out a way around that because few can resist the pull of TikTok\u2019s can\u2019t-stop-scrolling content. I expect it will take more than a ban to erase TikTok.This article was updated to correct a typo.",

        "body": "After weeks of silence from the House of Representatives on Auditor Diana DiZoglio's announcement that she plans to audit the Legislature, the counsel for the House responded on Friday, saying the state constitution \"explicitly and repeatedly prohibits\" the action.\"That your office has the legal authority to conduct an audit of the General Court is a claim entirely without legal support or precedent, as it runs contrary to multiple, explicit provisions of the Massachusetts Constitution, and is wholly unnecessary as the public currently has full and ready access to the House's financial information,\" House Speaker Ron Mariano wrote in a letter addressed to DiZoglio.Mariano wrote that he \"respectfully denied\" DiZoglio's attempt to audit the body, and said the suggestion that she has the authority to do so \"violates basic separation of powers principles that the Supreme Judicial Court has called 'fundamental ... to our form of government.' \"In a statement responding to Mariano's letter, DiZoglio said Friday that she is \"not asking for permission.\"\"I find it disappointing the Speaker is fighting an audit of what is happening in the people's house, where the people's business is conducted, using the people's money. We are not asking for permission and will continue conducting our audit as planned to help increase transparency, accountability and equity for everyday families,\" she said.The development raises questions about how DiZoglio will audit parties that believe she is out of bounds, and whether a court judgement may be sought.The state auditor's governing statute says the office must audit the \"accounts, programs, activities and functions\" of \"all departments, offices, commissions, institutions and activities of the commonwealth, including those of districts and authorities created by the general court.\"The same section also gives the state Superior Court \"jurisdiction to enforce the production of records that the department requires to be produced pursuant to this section, and the court shall order the production of all such records within the scope of any such audit.\"House of Representatives' counsel James Kennedy disputes that the auditor's governing statute gives DiZoglio's office authority to audit the Legislature, saying it \"omits any reference to the General Court, and Section 12 as a whole, reveals that an audit of the General Court could not have been contemplated.\"He adds that the section of the statute that says the office is able to audit \"departments\" \"encompasses only agencies and offices within the executive branch and not the other separate branches of government.\"Kennedy brings up several other points in his letter, including that the House has the \"exclusive\" and \"absolute\" authority to \"settle the rules and orders of proceeding\" in the chamber; and that the Supreme Judicial Court previously ruled \"that such 'procedural statutes are not binding upon the Houses' and that each 'branch, under its exclusive rule-making constitutional prerogatives, is free to disregard or supersede such statutes by unicameral action.'\"Kennedy also references comments made by DiZoglio's predecessor, Suzanne Bump, who he writes said, \"the Legislature is not an agency or department but rather another branch of government and, thus, subject to protections under the separation of powers doctrine.\"When DiZoglio raised the idea of auditing the Legislature on the campaign trail, former Auditor Bump told CommonWealth Magazine that the auditor lacks authority to do so, prompting DiZoglio to respond that the Legislature should not be exempt from accountability.When the auditor, who previously served in both the House and Senate and was well-known for her clashes with leadership over transparency issues, announced the audit earlier this month, she said she hopes the move will \"increase transparency, accountability and equity in an area of state government that has been completely ignored.\" She added, \"Historically, the Legislature has been a closed-door operation, where committee votes have been hidden from the general public, and legislation has been voted on in the dark of night.\"During a taping of WCVB's On The Record, which will air on Sunday, Mariano said he believes DiZoglio is overreaching, WCVB reports.\"We operate independently and we're judged on what we do. I don't need someone with a political agenda, who's in the Executive Branch, passing judgment on me,\" Mariano told OTR.The Legislature is exempt from public records law and has come under criticism for keeping committee vote tallies private. Most joint committees do not publicly share a breakdown of how every lawmaker votes in the polls that advance or kill legislation, and the House and Senate do not take recorded votes even on most of the bills that make their calendars.DiZoglio included in her engagement letters to the House and Senate that her office would be reviewing \"budgetary, hiring, spending and procurement information, as well as information regarding acting and pending legislation, the process for appointing committees, the adoption and suspension of House and Senate rules and the policies and procedures of the House and Senate.\"Both chambers hold a public debate on their operating rules each session; the process of appointing committees is done behind closed doors.Mariano wrote in his letter to DiZoglio on Friday that the House's financial accounts are publicly available online, and that \"any performance assessment of the House of Representatives relative to its budgeting, hiring, spending and procurement, active and pending legislation, committee appointments, legislative rules, and its policies and procedures are the sole constitutional purview of the Members elected to the House of Representatives.\"DiZoglio told GBH recently that she is hoping to not have to involve the courts, but that she is willing to do so \"if necessary.\"\"I hope that the courts do not have to be involved in this conversation,\" she said. \"They shouldn't have to be involved in this conversation. That is a path that I said I would take if necessary, but ... I'm hoping that legislative leadership will come around.\"DiZoglio has also made headlines by saying the Legislature hasn't been audited since 1922, which both the House and Senate have now contested.\"Unfortunately, the Legislature has not been audited since 1922, while Massachusetts ranks as one of the least transparent and least accessible state governments in the nation,\" DiZoglio wrote to lawmakers on March 7.Though the House did not respond to her announcement until Friday, Senate President Karen Spilka issued a statement on March 7 saying the Senate undergoes an audit every year.\"Under the Massachusetts Constitution and as the separation of powers clause dictates, the Senate is required to manage its own business and set its own rules. Those rules require that the Senate undergoes an audit every fiscal year by a certified public accounting firm experienced in auditing governmental entities and provide that audit to the public. Further, Senate business is made public through journals, calendars and recordings of each session, while payroll and other financial information is publicly available on the Comptroller's website. If anyone wishes to view this information, it is available to the public,\" a Spilka spokesperson said.Now, the House has echoed the Senate's statements, saying it undergoes an audit from an independent firm every fiscal year.\"I want to first dispel the notion that the most recent audit of the House of Representatives was in 1922, as the Auditor has been publicly stating,\" Kennedy wrote. \"I presume that the 1922 document that the Auditor has been referencing is the Report of the Auditor for the Fiscal Year ending November 30, 1922, filed January 10, 1923. This report was not, nor does it reflect, an audit of the House of Representatives. In fact, we have no records of the Office of the State Auditor ever auditing the House of Representatives. A close inspection of the 1922 document itself, and of the historical context in which it was produced, makes it clear that this report is merely an accounting of the Commonwealth's revenue, expenses and debt, including those expenses of the Legislature and other branches and departments of the Commonwealth, including the Auditor's office itself. Clearly, such summaries of the Commonwealth's financial transactions do not amount to a performance audit in today's meaning.\"The most recent audit publicly available for each chamber and the Legislature's joint accounts is for fiscal year 2020.The Senate audit for fiscal year 2021 is currently with the auditor's office and \"work is underway,\" according to a spokesperson for the Senate President. The chamber received the fiscal year 2020 audit in August 2022 and anticipates receiving a completed audit for fiscal 2021 \"between now and August 2023.\"The four most recent publicly available audits of the House, Senate and joint accounts for fiscal 2017 through fiscal 2020 were all conducted by accounting and wealth management firm CliftonLarsonAllen LLP.The most recent Senate audit is nine pages and the House audit is eight pages.Run through Copyleaks, an online tool that checks how much overlap there is between two documents, the most recent House and Senate audits were found to be 85.7 percent identical.Both the House and Senate documents for fiscal 2020 include, among other details, a short summary of the CLA's responsibility as the auditor, an overview of how the legislative process works in Massachusetts, and financial statements on their budgetary accounts.The financial statements include: funds appropriated in the fiscal year budget, balance forward from the previous fiscal year, total available funds (the current year plus previous year's holdovers), expenditures, and balance forward to the next fiscal year.Neither audit includes a line item breakdown of spending.CLA found that the audited fiscal 2020 financial statement of both chambers \"presents fairly, in all material and respects, available resources and expenditures.\"Both the House and Senate audits also reference an internal control report, also conducted by CliftonLarsonAllen. When asked, the Senate President's office would not provide this document.Speaker Mariano's office did send their version of the internal controls report for fiscal year 2020.In it, CLA writes that they considered the House's internal control over financial reporting \"as a basis for designing audit procedures\" but \"not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the House's internal control.\"Therefore, it says, they do not give an opinion on the House's internal control. CLA also gives no opinion on the House's compliance with \"certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements.\"\"Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.\"Asked about the Legislature's previous audits, DiZoglio responded in a statement that \"if there was nothing to hide, legislative leaders should welcome meetings with our office regarding our performance audit -- like every other state entity has done.\"\"Legislative leaders should demonstrate respect to everyday working people seeking information by cooperating with our office's review,\" she said.",

        "body": "While Attorney General Andrea Campbell works to set up a new gun law enforcement unit in her office, she\u2019s also calling on credit card companies to play a role in combating gun violence. Last week, Campbell joined 13 attorneys general from other states in sending a letter to the four major credit card companies, urging them to help \u201cdisrupt\u201d gun violence. Visa, American Express, MasterCard and Discover earlier this month announced a pause on plans to adopt a new code distinctly categorizing sales at gun stores, a feature supporters say would help flag suspicious purchases made with credit cards. The AGs\u2019 letter argues that merchant category codes are routine and that political pushback from other states should not impede the move. \u201cIf you can track us going to Walmart and buying milk, why not guns? Which gives law enforcement critical tools to not only look at where people are buying, if gun hoarding is happening, but also if someone illegally purchased a weapon and used it in some horrific crime, law enforcement can go after them and hold them accountable,\u201d Campbell said on Boston Public Radio Friday. The attorney general announced plans to create a gun safety unit at her inauguration in January. She said Friday that she\u2019s starting an internal working group and reaching out to law enforcement as she develops both the gun unit and a police accountability unit. She described the gun enforcement unit as a one-stop shop within her office for sharing best practices around issues like firearm trafficking and the manufacturing of so-called ghost guns, untraceable weapons assembled from parts that are often bought online or made with 3-D printers. \u201cWe have folks in our state police unit that are doing trainings every day with local law enforcement,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cWe need legislative solutions, as well, to keep folks from being able to manufacture these weapons in Massachusetts and sell them. In addition, this same unit can also address gun violence in the community and make sure that survivors are getting the resources they need.\u201d Campbell is not alone in eyeing legislative action on guns. Gov. Maura Healey supports legislation banning ghost guns, and House Speaker Ron Mariano has said he wants to work this session on further strengthening the state\u2019s gun laws. Next Thursday, volunteers from Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense plan to visit the State House to lobby for what they describe as comprehensive gun safety legislation. Campbell also touched on the deluge of sports-betting ads now that the industry is up and running in Massachusetts. Campbell said she doesn\u2019t plan to stand in the way of the sports-betting law passed last summer, but that her office wants to protect consumers, particularly young people. She\u2019s been in communication with the state Gaming Commission as its members develop regulations, and said she wants there to be guardrails that prevent athletes, influencers and experts from making money by recommending particular wagers. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t get paid, for example, for encouraging you to place a certain bet that will likely lose and get a percentage of those losses,\u201d Campbell said.",

        "body": "In a surprise announcement, U.S. Rep. David Cicilline said he is stepping away from politics. Cicilline has represented Rhode Island in Congress for over a decade. During his time in office, he took on Big Tech and served as the House impeachment manager for former President Donald Trump's second impeachment trial. He is also openly gay and an advocate for LGBTQ rights. So with all that apparent success, why is Cicilline resigning?\"There were a couple factors. One, he was offered a job as CEO of the Rhode Island Foundation, the big nonprofit funder here in Rhode Island. He's going to more than triple his salary to $650,000 compared what he made in Congress,\" WPRI politics and business editor Ted Nesi told Under the Radar. \"And he acknowledged it was just less appealing to stay in Congress, in the U.S. House, as a Democrat who is now in the minority, with a Republican majority who has very little he agrees with them on. And if we're being honest, Cicilline tried and failed to get into senior leadership position when the House leaders were changing over.\" Nesi said Cicilline's resignation was a shock to \"everyone in Rhode Island\" given the fact he was only a couple months into his latest term.Cicilline officially steps down on June 1. The special election to replace him will likely happen in November, so there will be several months without Rhode Island's 1st District represented in the U.S. House.Arnie Arnesen, host of \u201cThe Attitude with Arnie Arnesen\u201d on WNHN, said she was angry with Democrats for not putting him in a leadership position and was sad to learn of his resignation.\"Look at all these roles he played,\" she said. \"I actually kind of envisioned that maybe someday he might want to run for president. I really do think he has that kind of cred and credibility.\"Also on Under the Radar's Regional News Roundtable, guests discussed the aging Bourne and Sagamore bridges. Tens of thousands of cars drive across the nearly 100-year-old bridges to Cape Cod each day. Though the bridges are in desperate need of repairs, the federal government has rejected multiple requests for funding \u2014 although President Joe Biden's latest budget proposal would include a \"down payment.\" \"These bridges apparently have not a great design, and they're very difficult and expensive to repair. And it's that cost of repair \u2014 year over year \u2014 which is really driving the conversation here that they just have to be replaced entirely,\" said Steve Junker, managing editor of news at CAI. \"Right before the pandemic, they were talking about a price tag to replace both bridges of about $1 billion. And everybody thought 'Oh, that's a lot of money.' Now they're saying it could be as much as $4 billion.\" Arnesen said now is the time to think big about the bridge reconstruction.\"What the 'H' are you building? Because it's not just about a bridge. Because you're talking about also a bridge to the future. And what we know about the future is climate change. What we know about the future is maybe the desire for more public transportation. ... It's not just about a bridge, everyone. It changes the whole course of life.\"And, lastly, Under the Radar guests discussed how a high school in New Hampshire is training students for the Granite state\u2019s burgeoning outdoor tourism industry.

Based here in Revere, Massachusetts, the company played a historic role in the world of American candy. Necco manufactured national favorites like Clark Bars, Candy Buttons, Sky Bars and Sweethearts. But their bestseller was without a doubt the Necco wafers, dating back to 1847. Interestingly, Necco marketed its wafers in a number of ways. Darlene Lacey, an author and curator of the Candy Wrapper Museum, told Under the Radar that the company wasn't really sure how to position the candy.\"In the early times, they focused on them being the perfect treat for hostesses at afternoon teas. They had them described as a 'fairy feast' in a garden of delights. Very delicate, very romantic,\" she described. \"... And then as time went on, they started to skew them a little bit more towards kids, and then later into the nostalgia market.\"The company was sold a handful of years ago to the Ohio-based Spangler Candy Company. But how did this shift impact the candy manufacturing world? Under the Radar talked with Lacey about everything from favorite sweet treats to the future of the candy production industry.",

        "body": "As evictions spike in Boston and across Massachusetts, state legislators are under increasing pressure to extend key COVID-era protections for tenants that are slated to expire next week. Adam Reilly is joined by Andrea Park, the director of community driven advocacy at the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute, and state Representative Mike Connolly to discuss that push and the political challenges currently facing legislation that could mitigate housing insecurity. Park says the protections that are about to sunset have already helped thousands of Massachusetts residents stay in their homes, and warns that lessons learned during COVID are at risk of being forgotten as we try to put the pandemic behind us. Connolly agrees that the protections should be extended into 2024, and also says rent control \u2014 also known as rent stabilization \u2014 remains \u201cquite viable\u201d on Beacon Hill despite a notably cool reception from House Speaker Ron Mariano.Do you think state government is doing enough to protect tenants as Massachusetts emerges from COVID?

        "body": "On this week\u2019s edition of the Joy Beat, the All Things Considered team found the perfect guest. We love to have on local experts and future leaders to celebrate their accomplishments, but what\u2019s especially awesome about this guest is that he\u2019s just 10 years old. Meet Tanoshi Inomata, a fourth grader who just won the Boston spelling bee and will be heading to Washington, D.C., for the national spelling bee in May. Tanoshi and his parents, Hiromi and Chikao, joined All Things Considered host Arun Rath to spell out his victory.Arun Rath: Tanoshi, you must have studied very hard for this. Tell us how you felt when you realized you were the winner.Tanoshi Inomata: I was surprised that I was the big champion because even though I practice a lot every day, I never thought I could. Because, first of all, there are like 4,000 words on the list. There are three levels of words on the list: level one is easy, level two is intermediate and level three is hard. I thought I couldn\u2019t win because, on level three, there were four language origins with no rules to spell for them. Rath: Wow. For level three, do you remember what the last word that you won on was?Tanoshi: My championship word was \u2018ancho.\u2019 Rath: How do you spell that?Tanoshi: You spell it A-N-C-H-O.Rath: I have no idea what that means.Tanoshi: It means a dried mixture of poblano chili peppers. Rath: Oh, right! That\u2019s actually something that I just learned today. So when you spelled that out, did you feel confident that you had the spelling right? What was your sense of it?Tanoshi: I was pretty confident because even though when I first practiced, I got it wrong. But then I started practicing it and I got it right.Rath: That\u2019s brilliant. Congratulations!Tanoshi: Thank you.Rath: I didn\u2019t realize this, but apparently, only one other person from Massachusetts has won the national spelling bee. That was over 80 years ago. How do you feel about it?Tanoshi: I feel like now I want to win the national spelling bee and show off to everyone.Rath: Are you feeling confident?Tanoshi: Yeah. Now I\u2019m practicing two times a day. I\u2019m practicing in the morning every weekday with Mr. Noll, the school librarian at the Winship School. And after that, after school with my mom every day, even on the weekends.Rath: Tanoshi, I\u2019m curious, what\u2019s a practice session like for spelling? Do you just run through lists of words?Tanoshi: Yeah. The first time I practiced with my mom, I just went through the whole list of words, and during the practice, I memorized the words that I missed.Rath: And Hiromi, you helped him out with those practice sessions later in the day?Hiromi: Yeah, I studied with him every evening. It\u2019s not easy for a fourth-grade boy to study alone every day. I think that coming soon, he\u2019ll be more independent and study on his own. After that, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll miss studying with him.Tanoshi: Me, too!Rath: It sounds like you have a good time together. That\u2019s awesome! And I can only imagine how proud you must be.Tanoshi: I also made an art piece. I made it by cutting and pasting the cutout from my face of the spelling bee last year. Rath: Was that to psych yourself up to win?Tanoshi: Yeah.Rath: That\u2019s awesome. Well, it worked! Are you gonna do that also for D.C.? Tanoshi: Yeah. And I\u2019m going to bring this one to D.C. also.Rath: So you\u2019ll be heading to Washington in May. Are you going to be practicing every day between now and then?Tanoshi: Yeah.Rath: Do you have a favorite word to spell?Tanoshi: I like to spell long words. For example, tintinnabulary. Rath: Tintinnabulary has to do with a ringing of bells?Tanoshi: Yeah.Rath: Can you spell that out for me, if you don\u2019t mind showing off?Tanoshi: T-I-N-T-I-N-N-A-B-U-L-A-R-Y. Tintinnabulary. Rath: Brilliant. We\u2019re so happy that you\u2019re going to nationals and representing us. Good luck! We can\u2019t wait to hear how it goes. Tanoshi: Oh, actually, I have one more thing. We listen to WGBH all the time in our car. It\u2019s because we like the classical music.",

        "body": "Seed is a word that comes up a lot this time a year \u2014 in gardens, bird feeders, and March Madness brackets, where it\u2019s used to denote team rankings coming into the tournament. But why do we use the word \"seed\" in our brackets? \u201cIf you stop and think about it, it is pretty strange that we use this word seed to describe somebody's ranking in a tournament,\u201d Edgar B. Herwick III, GBH\u2019s Curiosity Desk reporter, told Morning Edition hosts Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel on Friday. \u201cI mean, this is a farming word. It's an agricultural world word. But there is a sort of reason how this came to be. And one of the people we can thank for it is Major Walter Clopton Wingfield.\u201dWingfield was a Welsh Renaissance man back in the 19th century. He was a crucial figure in the development of another sport: tennis. Wingfield created a version of the game called lawn tennis, the forerunner of modern tennis played across the world today. This sport took hold in the late 1800s in the UK, and spread across the ocean to country clubs in the U.S.\u201cAll of a sudden tennis tournaments become the rage right in the late 1800s,\u201d Herwick said. \u201cThese tournaments start drawing more and more spectators, and eventually a problem arises in that too often, really good players are playing each other early in these tournaments. And by the time they get to the finals, the semifinals, it's boring because all of the good players have knocked each other out.\u201dSo an idea emerged: Why not rank the top players and spread them across early tournament matches? \u201cThey would spread the good players evenly across the draw, just like you would spread seeds in a garden,\u201d Herwick said. \u201cAnd so this practice becomes known as seeding, and the term and the practice really catches on quickly in tennis and then eventually spreads to other sports.\u201dExactly who came up with the term \u201cseed\u201d seems to have been lost to history, Herwick said. But the first tournament it was used in was a local one. \u201cExperts believe that the very first time it was probably used was in 1890 at the U.S. National Championship, which was played in Newport, Rhode Island,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd for the record, that championship is still played today. It's now known as the U.S. Open and they play it in New York.\u201dBasketball borrowed the term from tennis. \u201cThe NCAA tournament itself, that started as an eight-team draw, no seeding, back in 1939,\u201d Herwick said. \u201cThe first time that they started seeding the tournament [was] in the 1970s. The first time the whole bracket was seeded was 1979. That ended up turning out pretty well because the final game that year was one of the most famous college football basketball games of all time. That was Michigan State versus Indiana State with two legends: Magic Johnson and Larry Bird.\u201d",

John Keenan said on Greater Boston. \u201cEverywhere they turn they are just being hit with this advertising.\u201dKeenan said sports betting ads have almost become inescapable, appearing on everything from trash cans to billboards. He said the constant exposure becomes an issue for those at risk of addiction and those who have struggled with gambling addiction in the past.Keenan said the strict regulations that exist for ads and promotions surrounding tobacco, alcohol and cannabis products are not in place for sports betting. He said companies use terminology such as \"no sweat bet\" or \"risk-free betting\" to be deceptive or misleading to customers. He cautioned that \"the house always wins\" in the long-term.Victor Ortiz, director of the Office of Problem Gambling Services, said gambling addiction shares many of the characteristics of substance addictions.\u201cA few years ago it was integrated as a substance addiction,\u201d Ortiz said. \u201cWhen you examine gambling addiction and substance addiction there is a profound overlap.\u201dOrtiz said his office has approached problem gambling treatment with similar strategies to substance abuse treatment.\u201cWe integrated the [gambling] helpline three years ago with the substance abuse helpline,\u201d Ortiz said.Keenan said what remains to be seen is the impact gambling addiction in the commonwealth will have on things like domestic violence and other issues in the home, especially any effects on children.\u201cAll of that is a silent cost and it\u2019s hard to quantify it.

NBC\u2019s political director Chuck Todd says that\u2019s part of the former president\u2019s \u201cmedia savvy\u201d when it comes to legal trouble. \u201cDonald Trump manufactured a story and most people fell for it,\u201d Todd said on GBH\u2019s Boston Public Radio Thursday. \u201cAnd it [the arrest] wasn\u2019t nearly as close as everybody made it seem. It\u2019s really frustrating to watch this when you know what he\u2019s doing, you see it happening in real time.\u201d The scandal results from adult film star Daniels\u2019 plans to sell her story about a 2006 affair with Trump, a relationship that Trump and his allies have repeatedly denied. Manhattan prosecutors are investigating a potentially illegal $130,000 payment to Daniels to keep the story quiet in the weeks leading up to the 2016 presidential election. Indicting a former president would be unprecedented in the nation\u2019s history. Trump turned to social media over the weekend to tell his supporters to protest his arrest, which he said would happen Tuesday. \u201cOne thing he is is media savvy about his legal problems,\u201d Todd said, pointing to multiple criminal investigations the former president is staring down. \u201cThe entire premise of Donald Trump\u2019s existence is about escaping a legal problem. That\u2019s how he has lived his life for the last 40 years, starting with the bankruptcies.\u201dBut for Todd, the uproar over Trump\u2019s apparently imminent arrest did prove one thing. \u201cIf he is living and breathing \u2014 and running \u2014 he is going to win this nomination,\u201d Todd predicted. He pointed to Republican politicians who questioned the legitimacy of the investigation into the former president. Florida governor and likely 2024 campaign rival Ron DeSantis insulted Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg over a \u201cmanufactured circus,\u201d and three House Republicans demanded that Bragg disclose documents detailing his criminal investigation. \u201cThis was a fascinating power play by Trump,\u201d Todd said. \u201cFor a man who is politically extraordinarily weak with the middle of the electorate ... it was an impressive show of influential bullying power.\u201d Who holds sway in the 2024 election is already top of mind on both sides of the aisle. Some are casting doubt on Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 political power and whether she should be on the Democratic ticket again in 2024. Looking back on the 2020 Democratic primary that catapulted Harris into the spotlight, Todd said she blemished her credibility by being inconsistent on the issues \u2014 most infamously, on Medicare for All. \u201cShe didn\u2019t know whether she was going to run as a progressive or run as a moderate. And she was struggling. She was trying to run in both lanes,\u201d Todd said. \u201cElizabeth Warren, on the other hand, knows exactly who she is,\u201d he continued. \u201cI think Elizabeth Warren\u2019s problem as a candidate was: she came across as inaccessible. ... It very much felt like she was a podium candidate, and she was a lecturer, rather than in the middle of it all.\u201d After voters elected two of the oldest-ever presidents in Trump and Biden, Todd thinks that age would be a problem for Warren if she tried to run for president in 2028, following Biden\u2019s reelection campaign in 2024. Warren would be 79 years old during the 2028 general election. \u201cIt may punish her, fairly or unfairly,\u201d the \u201cMeet the Press\u201d host said. \u201cOne thing you can count on America doing is overcorrecting on these things. If you told me in the next 10 years we elect two of our youngest presidents in the last 50 years or so, it wouldn\u2019t shock me.\u201d",

        "body": "Gov. Maura Healey has selected a new general manager for the MBTA, calling it the most important decision she has made so far as governor. Here are five things to know about Phillip Eng.The MBTA spent big to attract a new general manager. With a $470,000 base salary, Eng will be one of the top-paid transit agency chiefs in the country. The agency can also boost Eng's base pay with yearly performance-based bonuses and what has been called an \u201cannual retention payment\u201d of $30,000.Last year, former MBTA General Manager Steve Poftak pulled in just over $417,000 between his base pay and bonuses.Eng's most recent public transit role was leading the Long Island Rail Road, the largest commuter line in the country. He took over in 2018 after the former head resigned following a withering report that found the LIRR had \u201cits worst on-time performance in 18 years.\u201d In just four years under Eng\u2019s leadership, the railway saw continued improvements in the amount of trains operating on time, reaching a 96.3% on-time rate in 2021 \u2014 LIRR's best performance since modern record-keeping began in the 1970s.Before taking on the LIRR, he held a number of other positions in New York. He started out as a junior engineer for New York State's Department of Transportation in 1983, working his way up the ranks of the state agency over the next few decades. He became the department's chief engineer and executive deputy commissioner in 2013.Eng became chief operating officer of New York City\u2019s Metropolitan Transit Authority in 2017, and was then named interim president of NYC Transit before taking the lead at LIRR.In 2022, Eng joined the LiRo Group, an engineering consultant firm, as the company's executive vice president. In that position he worked with multiple public transportation agencies. He even got a taste of the MBTA through the firm's quality assurance work on the Green Line Extension project.As he explained at Monday\u2019s news conference: \u201cI\u2019d like to start off by addressing the big elephant in the room. No, I\u2019m not a Yankees fan.\u201d (Though he later admitted he\u2019s a Mets fan!)",

        "body": "Skiing is one of the most exhilarating outdoor activities you can do in New England, but it's also one of the most dangerous. So far in March, two skiers have died after accidents at Wachusett Mountain in Massachusetts and Pats Peak in New Hampshire, which included a 15-year-old boy. GBH legal analyst and Northeastern law professor Daniel Medwed joined Morning Edition hosts Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel to discuss the legal liability involved when people get injured on the slopes. This transcript has been lightly edited. Jeremy Siegel: So, Daniel, we know you love to ski. We also know there are dangers associated with skiing. There are also lots of legal issues, another one of your passions. When it comes to accidents on the slopes, to what extent might an injured skier, or a skier's family, be able to sue a resort and receive monetary compensation after an accident or something like it happens? Daniel Medwed: So it varies considerably from state to state. The law in Massachusetts is different from New Hampshire, which differs from that of Vermont. But the gist is basically the same. It's extremely difficult to sue a ski resort for your injuries. And here's why: the first barrier is basically contractual. When you buy that lift pass, that ski ticket, you essentially waive either implicitly or explicitly, your right to sue the mountain for certain risks inherent in the dangerous activity of downhill skiing. The second barrier is often baked into the law. It's part of our statutory framework. So, for instance, Massachusetts specifies in law what the duties of skiers are. This is actually part of our code. So, for instance, a skier shall maintain control of speed and course at all times, and a skier shall be presumed to know the range of their own ability on the slopes. So if you're going too fast, if you're out of control, if you're on that triple diamond black slope when you're really an intermediate skier, then you might be waiving any potential recourse for injuries against the mountain. Paris Alston: Daniel, I wonder if there are any ways to overcome these obstacles. Because it can be tricky, right? In the case of a skier at Wachusett Mountain, he hit a tree. And in the one of the 15-year-old boy at Pats Peak, he hit a bump on a trail that he had gone down a few times before previously. So what if the resort is maybe doing a bad job of maintaining the trails, or there's something else that's playing a role in creating a hazardous condition for the skier? Could you file a lawsuit in those situations? Medwed: Well, it really depends. I mean, these barriers are not insurmountable. It's not as if we give these ski mountains a complete free pass when it comes to liability. So there's a law in Massachusetts that's parallel to the duties of skiers, which imposes duties on ski resorts. Ski resorts have to conspicuously indicate the presence of snowmaking machines and other equipment to avert a potential crash. And also: they have to put flashing or rotating lights on emergency or maintenance vehicles. And I think a failure of the ski resort to comply, to breach that duty, could give rise to a personal injury action. But if that's the case, Paris and Jeremy, I think skiers really have to be mindful of another potential booby trap, which are there are often very strict statutes of limitations for skiers to bring an action against a ski resort. So in Massachusetts, you have to alert the mountain within 90 days, in writing by registered mail, about the accident and provide details about the accident or else you might waive your claim. And even then, you have to file your lawsuit within one year of the accident. Siegel: Everything you've said over the past couple of minutes makes it sound like the law is essentially stacked in favor of resorts. Medwed: Yeah, I think that's right. So on the one hand, I suppose the rationale here is that if there were not barriers on the liability for ski resorts, it would be too cost-prohibitive to ever operate a ski slope. The cost of insurance alone would be astronomical. And the only way you could make a go of it would be by passing the cost on to the consumer in the form of even higher lift tickets. We know how expensive they already are. On the other hand, I think it's a really fair question, and Jeremy, you allude to this, about whether the balance right now is tilted too far in favor of ski resorts. Alston: So, Daniel, you just mentioned the challenges with filing lawsuits against ski resorts, but a lot of accidents are a result of collisions with other skiers, right? I mean, Gwyneth Paltrow has been on the stand in Utah this week talking about this exact thing. Sometimes it's due to careless behavior by other skiers. Are there any restrictions on suing your fellow skiers for causing injuries to you? Medwed: Well, those actions are typically governed by general tort law or personal injury principles. So if another skier is negligent, maybe he or she has breached those duties of the skier that I mentioned, then perhaps that could give a basis for the injured party to file a tort action, a civil liability action, against that individual. So, for example, a bedrock principle of skiing, which is sometimes included in the law explicitly, is that a skier up the hill has an obligation to avoid a collision with a skier down the hill. It's a little bit like rear ending while driving, right? The person higher up bears the responsibility. And so if that skier does get into a collision with someone downhill, then conceivably that could give the basis for a private personal injury action. Siegel: But I guess that's sort of dependent on one skier actually stopping after the accident. Like I'm thinking of hit and runs in cars. Sometimes there's a collision and then the uphill skier might just keep going. Are there any consequences for leaving the scene of a skiing accident? Medwed: And regrettably, that happens all the time. And there are some consequences. So Massachusetts has a law on the books which says that you can get fined not less than $100 \u2014 It's not a huge fine but you can get fined \u2014 if you knowingly have an accident on a ski slope and then you depart without providing your personal identification or clearly identifying yourself to the person you've injured. Now, of course, that's dependent on someone actually catching you as you go down the mountain, some good Samaritan further down the slope. But there is a law on the books, at least in Massachusetts, to govern that. Alston: So it sounds like that's mostly civil liability or personal injury actions. But say a good Samaritan does catch you. Could you ever be found guilty of a crime for injuring someone on a ski slope? Medwed: There are cases out there, and they're relatively rare, of criminal actions that derive from accidents on ski slopes. There's a relatively famous case from Vail Resort in Colorado from about 25 years ago where a kid had had a little bit too much to drink, was hurtling down a mountain going on moguls. It was a bumpy slope. He had his arms out. He was sitting back on his skis to maximize his speed. And unfortunately, he got some air and hit somebody in the head with the tip of his ski. And the blunt force trauma caused a death. And ultimately, the Colorado Supreme Court said it was appropriate to charge him, to have the jury consider whether that was reckless manslaughter. Did he consciously disregard the substantial risk of death when he engaged in that type of reckless behavior? So it happens. It's relatively rare, but there are criminal actions that derive from ski accidents occasionally.",

        "body": "It\u2019s been nearly three years since Norwood Hospital was forced to close because of severe flooding \u2014 and while ground was broken for a new hospital in November 2021, town officials say it\u2019s not expected to open until 2025. That day can\u2019t come soon enough for leaders in Norwood. Interim Fire Chief Jim Wright says Norwood continues to feel the pain of not having the hospital in town. \u201cIt is a challenge. Our transport times are significantly longer,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would like it if our citizens could get to the hospital in two minutes rather than 15 or 20 minutes, but there is nothing we can do until the hospital is built.\u201dNorwood has two ambulances in service that transport patients to Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital-Needham, hospitals in Boston and Good Samaritan Medical Center in Brockton. But the strain got worse after a major fire shut down Brockton Hospital last month. Wright says Good Samaritan Medical Center is no longer an easy option because patients that would have gone to Brockton are now being rerouted there. Often, residents rely on other towns to get them to hospitals in mutual-aid ambulances supplied by surrounding towns, which answer the call when Norwood doesn\u2019t have an ambulance free. Norwood\u2019s ambulances are now often stuck out of town after delivering patients to a farther-away hospital. \u201cLuckily, we have firefighters that respond and do initial care, but many times we have to wait for a mutual-aid ambulance to come in,\u201d Wright said. Norwood Town Administrator Tony Mazzucco says he doesn\u2019t think anyone ever envisioned that two hospitals in Massachusetts would be closed at the same time. Heavy rain and flash flooding took out Norwood Hospital in June 2020, permanently shutting down the 215-bed facility. Then, in early February of this year, the 10-alarm fire at Brockton Hospital forced roughly 160 patients to evacuate. Brockton Hospital\u2019s operator estimates the site will reopen in late spring. Mazzucco is closely following the rebuilding of Norwood Hospital. He says the former building has been fully demolished, and the foundation for the new hospital is nearly complete. \u201cWhat you\u2019ll likely see in about two or three months is the building\u2019s steel frame going up,\u201d Mazzucco said. \u201cSo, we\u2019re very excited. There have been a lot of these cathartic moments in the process, and the appearance of the steel beams is one of them.\u201d Mazzucco says he knows five years is a long time to wait for a new medical facility but also recognizes the complexities that are involved. Norwood Hospital is the first hospital to be built from the ground up in Massachusetts in more than 25 years, with new technologies \u2014 and new supply chain issues \u2014 emerging in the last few decades.\u201cIt\u2019s rare that a hospital is built in this part of the country, so there\u2019s a little bit of a learning curve for everyone involved,\u201d he said. Mazzucco also gives kudos to the Norwood community at large. \u201cIt\u2019s a big burden on people. You want to go where your doctor is, you want to go where you\u2019re used to.\u201dSteward Health Care, which owns Norwood Hospital, declined to comment at this time. Its website says, when completed, the medical facility will have 130 total acute care beds, emergency services including trauma, pediatric and behavioral health capabilities, advance diagnostic imaging services and outpatient services.The new hospital is also expected to support 4,000 jobs.",

        "body": "As Elizabeth Warren launches a bid for a third term in the U.S. Senate, recent polling might seem, at first glance, to suggest that her reelection is far from guaranteed.Earlier this year, a survey by the MassINC Polling Group found Massachusetts residents sharply divided on Warren, with 41% viewing her favorably and 36% unfavorably. A similar split was evident on the question of whether Warren should run again: 43% said she should, while 36% said she shouldn\u2019t.But MassINC pollster Steve Koczela says when it comes to gauging Warren\u2019s current prospects, those results might actually paint an inordinately bleak picture. \u201cShe starts off in a pretty similar place, honestly, to where she was in 2018,\u201d Koczela said, referring to Warren\u2019s last reelection bid. \u201cHer polling, looking back at 2017, wasn\u2019t particularly sparkling, but she went on and cruised to reelection.\u201dIn the 2018 general election, Warren faced former state representative Geoff Diehl \u2014 who had triumphed in a three-way Republican primary \u2014 and beat him handily, 60% to 36%. Koczela\u2019s caveat comes with an asterisk of its own: Diehl, who\u2019d been an early supporter of Donald Trump, personified the Massachusetts Republican Party\u2019s recent turn to the right and preference for ideological purity over electability. A few years after losing to Warren, when then-Republican Gov. Charlie Baker was still weighing whether to seek a third term, Diehl announced a gubernatorial bid of his own, seemingly undeterred by his Senate loss or Baker\u2019s high statewide approval ratings. Baker didn\u2019t run again, and Diehl lost the governor\u2019s race to Maura Healey in a landslide.After a disastrous 2022 election cycle, the Mass. GOP ousted former party chair Jim Lyons and replaced him with Amy Carnevale, who has vowed to rebuild it from the ground up. But Carnevale\u2019s project is just beginning, and the Mass. GOP is still at a nadir in terms of influence and reputation. Against that backdrop, it\u2019s not clear that any electable Republican capable of going toe to toe with Warren \u2014 who made a strong run for the presidency in the 2020 cycle \u2014 will try to unseat her next year. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen quality Republican moderates run and win the governor\u2019s office in Massachusetts,\u201d said UMass Boston political scientist Erin O\u2019Brien. \u201cBut the Massachusetts Republican Party has put out people like Charlie Baker, who was that popular governor, and run people like Geoff Diehl.\u201cIn the abstract, a moderate Republican could do well in Massachusetts,\u201d O\u2019Brien added. \u201cBut it\u2019s only in the abstract, because that individual either doesn\u2019t exist or has been forced out of Massachusetts politics.\u201dIn a text message, Carnevale told GBH News that she expects the party will field a credible challenge to Warren 2024, and that \u201cat least two Republicans\u201d are currently considering a run. She declined to identify them.Warren will also be boosted, in her latest bid, by high popularity among members of her own party \u2014 which make up roughly a third of the state\u2019s voters. In MassINC\u2019s poll, which was conducted in late January and early February, 68% of Democrats viewed her favorably and 69% thought she should run again. In March, another poll, conducted by Change Research for Northwind Strategies, found that while almost as many people viewed Warren unfavorably as favorably, 30% viewed her very favorably \u2014 more than any other Massachusetts politician polled, including Baker.Those numbers suggest two things. First, in a hypothetical 2024 general election matchup, Warren would benefit from a loyal core of supporters who would organize for her, give her money and show up at the polls. And second, anyone who might entertain the prospect of a primary challenge against Warren would face a daunting challenge. The timing of Warren\u2019s announcement is also fortuitous. As bad as the crisis of confidence currently roiling the U.S. banking system is, it\u2019s likely to be a political asset for Warren as she begins campaigning again in earnest. \u201cThat\u2019s ... her bread-and-butter sort of issue,\u201d said Shannon Jenkins, a political scientist at UMass Dartmouth. \u201cThat\u2019s what she knows inside and out. She\u2019s one of the foremost experts on banking policy in the U.S. government right now.\u201dBy renewing her calls for rigorous regulation of the banking industry, Jenkins added, Warren can bolster her standing with the progressive Democrats who make up her political base while appealing to other voters, as well.\u201cNot a lot of people are pro-big banks, right?\u201d said Jenkins. \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of a gut reaction from voters.\u201dDespite all these advantages, though, Warren has some weaknesses that are worth bearing in mind as the 2024 Massachusetts Senate race shapes up.Koczela notes that, when the MassINC poll was conducted earlier this year, Warren\u2019s standing was relatively weak among younger voters, many of whom hadn\u2019t yet formed an opinion of her. Within the state, she\u2019s also more popular with well-educated voters and voters who live close to Boston. In an email, Tatishe Nteta, a political scientist at UMass Amherst and the director of the UMass Poll, noted that surveys he\u2019s worked on show a \u201csteady majority\u201d of Massachusetts residents approve of Warren\u2019s performance, and that she\u2019s been a reliable champion on student-loan forgiveness, income inequality and several other progressive causes highlighted in her campaign kickoff video.But Nteta also said Warren\u2019s performance in the 2020 Massachusetts Democratic presidential primary \u2014 in which she finished third, behind Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders \u2014 suggests she could be vulnerable to a primary challenge from the right.\u201cSome will say that voters in Massachusetts voted strategically for a candidate that could win in a general election matchup with Trump, but some might view these results as evidence of Warren\u2019s weakness among the moderate wing of the Democratic Party and among independents in the state,\u201d Nteta wrote.",

        "body": "State Auditor Diana DiZoglio dismissed top lawmakers\u2019 claims that she lacks the authority to audit the Legislature on Monday, days after House Speaker Ron Mariano said he wouldn\u2019t comply with her probe. \u201cWe\u2019ve already started the process of conducting the audit,\u201d DiZoglio said in an interview on Boston Public Radio. \u201cWith all due respect to Speaker Mariano, he is one of 200 legislators. Other legislators are more than welcome to speak to our office. Now, they might want to not do that so publicly due to the potential fear of retaliation, but they are able to speak with us. Their staff is as well.\u201dDiZoglio, a Methuen Democrat who has served in both the state House and Senate, was elected auditor last fall after a campaign in which she pledged to audit both the Legislature and the MBTA. She announced March 7 that she\u2019d launched her review of the Legislature, a body that she called \u201ca closed-door operation.\u201d She said she wanted to identify ways state government can do better.DiZoglio\u2019s predecessor, former Auditor Suzanne Bump, said last year that she didn\u2019t believe the office had the authority to audit the Legislature. Mariano and Senate President Karen Spilka appear to share that interpretation of state law.Mariano, in a letter to DiZoglio Friday, and Spilka, in a statement earlier this month, said the House and Senate have rules that require regular audits from outside firms and publicly post their financial information. They both pointed to the Massachusetts Constitution\u2019s separation of powers among the different branches of government. \u201cThat your office has the legal authority to conduct an audit of the General Court is a claim entirely without legal support or precedent, as it runs contrary to multiple, explicit provisions of the Massachusetts Constitution, and is wholly unnecessary as the public currently has full and ready access to the House\u2019s financial information,\u201d Mariano wrote.But in Monday\u2019s interview, DiZoglio made it clear she disagreed. She said that the separation of powers argument is \u201cbogus\u201d because her office audits the courts, mentioning an audit of the Supreme Judicial Court she plans to release soon. \u201cThe Legislature is unfortunately \u2014 not the entire Legislature \u2014 legislative leadership is unfortunately, yes, using that as, frankly, an excuse to not be audited,\u201d she said. \u201cI find it very disappointing.\u201dThe audit standoff comes as the House and the Senate are gearing up to write and debate their versions of next year\u2019s budget, deciding how much money to dedicate to each corner of state government \u2014 including the auditor\u2019s office. Mariano, in an interview on WCVB that aired Sunday, pointed to that dynamic as one reason he doesn\u2019t believe the audit is appropriate. \u201cI have authority over the auditor\u2019s budget, so there are inherent conflicts when you start crossing the executive branch with the legislative branch or the judicial branch, and the constitution is designed to not allow those interferences,\u201d he said. Gov. Maura Healey\u2019s budget proposal recommends funding the auditor\u2019s office and its various divisions at a total of $26.6 million for the next fiscal year, nearly $4 million more than what was in this year\u2019s budget. DiZoglio said if the Legislature decides not to \u201cadequately\u201d fund her office in retaliation for her audit, \u201cthey would be retaliating against the residents of Massachusetts who deserve to know how their taxpayer dollars are being spent.\u201d DiZoglio said she hopes her review of the Legislature will increase transparency and accountability on Beacon Hill. Massachusetts is unique among state governments because its courts, governor\u2019s office and Legislature all claim exemption from public records laws. The state\u2019s open meeting law, too, excludes the Legislature.\u201cRight now, bills are being voted on in the dark of night, committee votes are not being made public, even legislators sometimes don't have the opportunity to read bills upwards of 100 pages or more until just before the vote is being taken,\u201d DiZoglio said.",

        "body": "BOSTON (AP) \u2014 Phillip Eng, an engineer with decades of experience running public transit systems, has been named the general manager of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, the Boston area\u2019s troubled public transit agency, Gov. Maura Healey announced Monday.Eng, the former president of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u2019s Long Island Rail Road and one-time interim President of New York City Transit, is currently executive vice president at the engineering consultant firm The LiRo group.\u201cPhil Eng is the proven leader the MBTA needs to improve safety and reliability across the system and restore the public\u2019s trust,\u201d Healey said in a statement. \u201cHe understands that a functioning transportation system is essential to a functioning economy, and he has a track record of taking the reins of struggling public transit systems and dramatically improving service.\"The MBTA, which oversees the nation's oldest subway system as well as commuter rail, bus and ferry service, has come under intense scrutiny in recent years for a series of safety issues that led to a federal review and a series of orders to fix the problem.The Federal Transit Administration in June issued four \u201cspecial directives\u201d that required the MBTA to better staff its operations control center; improve track maintenance; address unintended and uncontrolled train movements in maintenance facilities and rail yards; and ensure that all employee training certifications are up to date.Problems included the death of a subway rider last April who was dragged along a platform when his arm got stuck in a malfunctioning subway car door. Nine people were injured in September 2021 when an escalator at a station malfunctioned, and more than two dozen people went to the hospital in July 2021 when a Green Line train rear-ended another trolley.Last July, a subway train caught fire as it was crossing a bridge north of Boston, prompting one passenger to jump into the Mystic River and others to scramble out of windows.\u201cIt\u2019s time for a new way of doing business at the MBTA,\" Eng said in a statement. \u201cAs an engineer, a transportation professional for 40 years, and a commuter myself, I\u2019m laser focused on finding innovative solutions to complex problems and approaching them with a sense of urgency that always puts the customer first.\u201dAs interim president of NYC Transit, he was integral in initiating and implementing the $836 million plan to fix aging infrastructure and improve performance. As President of the MTA Long Island Rail Road from 2018 to 2022, he turned around on-time performance and oversaw the implementation of technology that improved the accuracy of train arrival time estimates.Steve Poftak, the MBTA's previous general manager, stepped down in January just before Healey took office. Jeff Gonneville has served as interim general manager and will assist with the transition to new management.",

        "body": "As military members and elected officials gathered at the State House Tuesday to honor Marines who served in the Battle of Iwo Jima, neither Gov. Maura Healey nor Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll was on hand. Instead, sitting quietly to the side (until it was his turn to offer remarks), was the man who steps in when both Healey and Driscoll \u2014 and their predecessors for the last three decades \u2014 are away: Secretary of State Bill Galvin. Healey and Driscoll are both out of state during the February school vacation week, Healey in Florida until Thursday and Driscoll in Georgia until Sunday. When both leave Massachusetts, an acting governor is in charge. Under the Massachusetts Constitution, when both the governor\u2019s and lieutenant governor\u2019s office are vacant \u2014 \u201cby reason of death, absence from the commonwealth, or otherwise\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s up to the secretary of state to fulfill duties of both. In this case, that means Galvin, a Brighton Democrat who\u2019s taken on the acting governor role many times since he was first elected secretary in 1994 \u2014 so many times, in fact, that a spokesperson said he\u2019s likely lost count. If Healey, Driscoll and Galvin are all out of state (or if one of them leaves office for another reason), the line of succession moves across the other statewide elected officers. In order, it\u2019s: Attorney General Andrea Campbell, Treasurer Deb Goldberg and Auditor Diana DiZoglio. The state constitution stops there, specifying no further acting governors after the auditor. During a vacancy of the two top offices, the constitution gives the acting governor \u201cfull power and authority to do and execute all and every such acts, matters and things as the governor or the lieutenant-governor might or could lawfully do or execute, if they, or either of them, were personally present.\u201dGalvin over the years has signed bills while serving as acting governor, and if a natural disaster or other emergency breaks out while he is in charge, he\u2019ll need to step in for the response. He\u2019s also filed bills at times. The one \"that brought him the most notoriety\" was a 1998 bill that sought to force more financial transparency from HMOs, according to a 2003 New York Times profile that said he\u2019s held the acting governor role more times than anyone else in Massachusetts history. In most cases, though, an acting governor taking the reins is a brief, behind-the-scenes occurrence, involving close communication with the traveling governor and little impact on the day-to-day for most Massachusetts residents. Typically, the governor and lieutenant governor are not both away from Massachusetts for extended periods of time. The line of succession takes on more significance in the instances when the state is without a lieutenant governor \u2014 for instance, after Lt. Gov. Tim Murray resigned in 2013, Galvin regularly had to step in when then-Gov. Deval Patrick was away.Governor is not the only office whose duties can shift with travel plans. In Boston, if the mayor is away from the city or otherwise unable to perform their duties, the City Council president becomes acting mayor.",

        "body": "Updated at 10:53 a.m. Feb. 24SeparatorWhen Larysa Atamas first arrived in Everett last year, the sounds of the flights taking off and landing at nearby Logan Airport were a terrifying reminder of the war she had just escaped in Ukraine.\u201cIt was bad the first couple of months because I\u2019d wake up and think, \u2018My God, they\u2019re bombing us,\" she said. It didn\u2019t fully sink in that she was safe until June, when she saw children in a park playing baseball, a sport she associates with the United States.\u2018\u201cI thought, \u2018Oh my God, I'm in America!\u2019\u201dAtamas is now living in Cambridge with her husband, Vlad, and their 9-year old, Max. They are among at least 2,000 Ukrainians who have fled to Massachusetts since Russia invaded their country last February.Atamas and Max left their home in a heavily targeted manufacturing district in Eastern Ukraine a week into the war, riding a train westbound that stopped and started throughout the night with its lights out, hoping to escape detection. Cellphones were turned off to avoid being a target of Russian airstrikes, and passengers watched the countryside as bombs lit up the sky. They spent two months in refugee camps, and escaped the home of volunteers she believed to be human traffickers, all while separated from Vlad, who was mandated to remain in Ukraine under military policy. Vlad was ultimately allowed to leave to help care for his son, because Max has a seizure disorder and behavioral health problems. They flew to Mexico and crossed the U.S. border on April 18. How long Atamas\u2019 family and other Ukrainians can stay in the U.S. is an open question. They have arrived amid changing government programs, all with different rules and expiration dates.Under the federal rule that existed the day they entered the country, Atamas, her husband and son were granted humanitarian parole when they turned themselves in at the border. That means they can legally remain in the U.S. for a year, minus two days. That clock runs out on April 16.\u201cWe don\u2019t know what happens after,\u201d she said.Anastasiia Bondarenko has two years. The 29-year-old woke up the morning that was supposed to be her beauty shop grand opening and instead found bombs raining down on Kharkiv, the glass of nearby windows vibrating.She and her husband Dmytro Bondarenko \u2014 an auto mechanic \u2014 and 7-year-old son, Tymur, escaped the city by car. \u201cI took my wedding dress. I don\u2019t know why I needed it. But it was pretty important for me,\u201d she said.Locals were hiding in bunkers, so the streets were empty \u201clike an apocalypse movie,\u201d she said. They encountered a line of young Ukrainian soldiers.\u2018\u201cThey looked ridiculous. I\u2019m a mom of a boy. They were milky-skinned boys, without beards, teenagers, with huge guns. I thought, \u2018You\u2019re too young to go there. Go home to your mom.\u2019 For me it was a shock,\" she said.They spent months scurrying from town to town ahead of missile strikes. Their longest stay was six weeks at a two-room cottage without power, shared with four others.Once out of Ukraine, Anastasiia and Dymitro heard about a program the Biden Administration launched, Uniting for Ukraine, which allows U.S. citizens or green card holders to sponsor Ukrainians, and offers legal status for two years under \u201chumanitarian parole.\u201dThey were sponsored by a stranger they found on Facebook, but some of the immigrants have been able to rely on family members already in the states. For Hanna Hurina, it was her niece, Svetala Atakhanova, who lives with her husband in Watertown. For Nadia Docenko, it was her children\u2019s godfather in Newton.With a pained expression, Hurina described her orchard back home in detail. Four cherry trees; three apple; two peach. \u201cI would eat from the harvest all summer long,\u201d she said as Atakhanova interpreted.The 68-year-old from Kyiv lost her husband just before the war, then took in many Ukrainians fleeing from the eastern part of the country. She decided to leave when Russians destroyed the electrical station powering her home.Svetlana convinced her to try Uniting for Ukraine, and filled out the application, which was approved in five days. It was Hurina\u2019s first time out of Ukraine, and she got to Logan Airport on Christmas Eve.\u201cWorkers came with a wheelchair and said they will take care of me,\u201d Hernia explained. \u201cI started crying. I said, \u2018No, no, Probably it's not for me.\u2019 They said, \u2018We know you from Ukraine, what you go through and please, we will take care of you. No worries.\u201d\u2019Nadia Docenko, 53, was at work in the office of a day care center when her manager ran in telling employees the Russians had invaded. Her 31-year-old daughter and teenager were home, so she rushed into a supermarket to find food, but abandoned that because of long lines. She and her children eventually left for a family home in a small town.Refuge was brief \u2014 a nearby oil refinery was bombed. \u201cI remember seeing the flames and thinking, \u2018oh my God. There is no safe place in Ukraine,\u2019\u201d said Docenko, who suffered from panic attacks.That\u2019s when she sent her children out of the country by foot. Their godfather from Massachusetts met them in Germany, and Docenko followed so they would qualify for the Uniting for Ukraine program. They moved to Newton in August.The newly arrived Ukrainians said they\u2019ve been moved by the kindness of the people who helped them on the journey, and by Americans here. Resettlement agencies are helping the parolees, who aren\u2019t eligible for the same federal cash assistance as refugees but qualify for similar social services, like SNAP, state housing funds, and MassHealth.Refugee agencies told GBH News they estimate about two thousand Ukrainians have arrived, but it\u2019s hard to tell precisely. The state\u2019s Office of Refugees and Immigrants reported 1,170 parolees arrived as of Jan. 31, reported to them by resettlement agency affiliates. The office said this is \u201cnot a comprehensive count\u201d and only a \u201csubset\u201d of the total number. Others could be sponsored through family and not need the help of agencies, so they aren\u2019t included in that count.Through Uniting for Ukraine, U.S. citizens or green card holders can apply to sponsor people escaping the war. The program is free, but the sponsor must show proof of financial wherewithal to support their guests.Catholic Charities of Boston is helping sponsors apply for the program, and is also part of a pilot called Welcome U.S., which lets groups sponsor an individual or a family in a so-called \u201cwelcome circle.\u201d The organization served 94 Ukrainians last year, mostly through Uniting for Ukraine.\u201cThere is a financial commitment that the [sponsor] needs to agree to because, you know, we need to make sure we're not bringing folks here and they just get left on the street,\u201d said Marjean Perhot, Catholic Charities of Boston Vice President for Refugees and Immigrants Services.She said welcome circles allow multiple sponsors to share responsibility. Participants assemble a \u201cWelcome Plan\u201d to outline how they\u2019ll help people with housing, transportation, enrolling children in school, and connect the migrants to jobs. It takes longer for a circle to be approved than individuals under Uniting for Ukraine.Many parolees are settling in Western Massachusetts, where there is a strong Ukrainian community. Jewish Family Services of Western Massachusetts has helped more than 360 individuals with over $346,000 in assistance, primarily for housing.The group connects refugees to immediate needs. \u201cI\u2019m talking English as a second language, employment services, youth-focused services, individual cash assistance benefits from the Department of Transitional Assistance,\u201d said Sara Bedford, New American program director there.The organization recently got a grant from the state to connect Ukrainians to certification training to get them licensed for their professions in Massachusetts. For many migrants, housing is the biggest hurdle, given high rent costs across the state. \u201cSometimes there are situations when a family of eight comes and they have a small two-room house or apartment and they have no other choice but to stay \u2026 until they find their own housing,\u201d said Alina Dyachenko, a Ukrainian caseworker at Jewish Family Services of Western Massachusetts. In Quincy, Anastasiia Bondarenko said her family\u2019s relationship with their sponsor grew tenuous, so they moved out and stayed with an American family before hearing about the International Institute of New England, a resettlement agency.The agency helped them with enrollment to MassHealth and school, and importantly, by writing a letter of support to a landlord, and paid for three month\u2019s rent. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of different here,\u201d said Bondarenko \u201cYou need to show your income level. You need to show your work. And if you're not have this, how can you rent an apartment?\u201dLarysa Atamas and her family left Everett and are now house-sitting in Cambridge. They got connected to that opportunity through Sam Wachman through the Ukrainian Boston Facebook group after Larysa posted asking for help finding Max's anti-convulsant medication. Wachman, 22, who studied Russian and worked in health care, helped the family get the medicine. He has also helped 15 Ukrainians apply for the Uniting for Ukraine program by showing them how to fill out documents, and connecting people abroad with potential sponsors.\u201cI generally look at families with children, the elderly, disabled, the ones most vulnerable,\u201d he said. He tries to work with people who know someone in the U.S. who can guide them through rebuilding a life here.Wachman said in most situations he\u2019s seen, it\u2019s Ukrainians who are living here and want to sponsor someone but aren\u2019t citizens or green card holders that just need someone to fill in the paperwork for their families abroad.For instance, he connected Vlad to a neighbor who could sponsor his parents. A few weeks ago, they arrived to help care for Max.Wachman also launched a nonprofit called Boston Ukrainian Action Committee to help parolees, and to send humanitarian aid abroad.He said many arriving Ukrainians are struggling with education for their children. Every family he\u2019s met has a child struggling in school. Atamas\u2019 child Max, for instance, exhibited few emotions during the months of travel, but then suddenly began acting out in \u201cways they\u2019d never seen before,\u201d his mother said.Enrolled in Everett Public Schools, his toys from Ukraine were taken away due to behavioral outbursts, said Wachman, who had to go to the school on behalf of the family. When the family tried to move Max to Cambridge Public Schools, they were told they couldn't because of Everett\u2019s behavioral reports, and also that there wasn't space in the school's program. School administrators pointed to private school as the only option \u2014 which the family can\u2019t afford. For now, Max travels to Everett for school. The family believes he just needs a district that knows how to work with children traumatized by war.With Wachman\u2019s help, they found a psychologist who works with war victims, and is seeing Max, but funds are running out.Finding employment is a continued challenge for Ukrainians who have fled to the United States due to the war. They can apply for work authorization once they\u2019re here, but the wait times are unpredictable. Federal rules for Ukrainians changed in November and they\u2019re allowed to work for three months as long as they\u2019ve applied for work authorization. Employers have to agree to that arrangement though, and most don\u2019t. Dmytro Bondarenko received authorization months before Anastasiia, but struggled to find work because mechanic shops require contractors to have their own tools, he said. He finally found one where other colleagues allowed him to borrow their tools, but that hampered the shop\u2019s workflow.Bondarenko created a GoFundMe to fundraise for tools, which cost about $8,000. He\u2019s a quarter of the way to the goal, but what he\u2019s been able to buy so far has made the work situation easier. He talks about how much he misses his shop in Ukraine, but wants to \u201crun his own in the U.S.\u201dThis isn\u2019t Bondarenko\u2019s first experience rebuilding his life. He and his mother fled the Donbas region of Ukraine when war came in 2014. \u201cI understand now I need to find some safe country to start with zero a second time,\u201d he said. \u201cI think United States is nice because it's powerful country \u2014 it's a safe place.\u201dHis wife Anastasiia received her work authorization a couple weeks ago. She\u2019s over seven months pregnant, but is considering work as an interpreter helping others like herself. In the months since moving to Massachusetts, she\u2019s helped other Ukrainians navigate the complex system of health insurance, and volunteered to get children toys.Svetlana Atakhanova and her husband in Watertown help other Ukrainian parolees by offering to connect them to employers for free through their employment agency, Job Exchange. They have a few parolees living in their home, and rented out a building in their name, which they sublease to refugees.In Newton, Nadia Docenko is afraid of leaving her relatives\u2019 home because she doesn\u2019t speak English. She\u2019s been trying to teach herself from library books, and said classes are too expensive. Not speaking English has posed a barrier to finding work. She\u2019s hoping to find a job in childcare, the industry she used to work in.In Cambridge, Atamas\u2019 husband commutes to work with his friend in construction. She found a job at a local Whole Foods whose manager goes out of her way to hire Ukrainian and Afghan parolees.But what happens when her parole expires in April?Jewish Family Services of Western Massachusetts has 28 clients who fall in the same category as Atamas, and could have benefits expire. Until Congress or the Biden administration make a move, how to help these individuals is up in the air.\u201cThey would either have to leave the U.S.; reapply for Uniting for Ukraine, which is a huge waste of resources; apply for asylum, which is a huge waste of resources; or remain relatively undocumented,\u201d said Bedford. Some families might not want to apply for asylum because they do eventually want to return to Ukraine, and wouldn\u2019t have strong asylum claims.If an individual applies for asylum, then decides to drop out of the process, their case is sent to immigration court for deportation proceedings, according to the American Immigration Lawyers Association of New England.Congressman Seth Moulton was among a bipartisan group of House lawmakers who traveled to Ukraine in December. \u201cWe stand ready to do whatever is needed to continue helping these refugees if any of these cliffs do come up,\u201d he said. Moulton said there\u2019s a bipartisan \u201cappetite to make sure we continue supporting Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees.\u201dThe war has no end in sight. Through a multitude of pathways, the United States welcomed more than 253,500 Ukrainians between last March and the end of January 2023, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Most parolees expressed ambivalence over whether or not they want to return. In Watertown, Hanna Hurina said she wants to stay just until spring, but her family is urging her to stay longer to address her heart condition, and avoid doctor shortages in Ukraine.\u201cI pray every day, every night the war will be ending,\u201d said Hurina. \u201cUkraine will win, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if all our homes are destroyed.\u201dDocenko in Newton wants to return, but said she came here \u201cfor a future life for my kids.\u201dAtamas feels guilty for leaving Ukraine, but says she can\u2019t go back. \u201cThe war may go on for many years. No one can know, and no one can predict. For many decades, Ukraine will be in squalor,\u201d she said.SeparatorThis story was updated to clarify the details of Bondarenko's fundraising effort.",

        "body": "The death of 20-year-old Sayed Faisal, who was shot by Cambridge police in early January during what appears to have been a mental health crisis, has sparked a discussion about alternatives to sending armed police to respond to mental health calls. It's a conversation that's been underway in Cambridge and other Massachusetts cities for years before this fatal incident. GBH News Reporter Craig LeMoult spoke with GBH\u2019s All Things Considered host Arun Rath about these ongoing conversations. What follows is a lightly edited transcript. Arun Rath: In a statement last week, the Cambridge city manager pledged that Cambridge will use alternative responses outside of the police department for some emergency calls. What kind of alternative responses is Cambridge looking at? Craig LeMoult: Yeah, what happened is after the murder of George Floyd, Cambridge City Council created a task force to examine what they call the future of public safety. And that task force made its recommendations in May of 2021. They included the creation of a new community safety department, which was outside of police. It'll be made up of peer counselors and mental health professionals who would respond to some nonviolent calls that are currently handled by police. The city allocated $3 million for that department, but I heard its creation was slowed down by a challenging time finding somebody to head it up. Last month, the city named an interim director of the department, and she told me they're planning to have responders from this new department going out on 911 calls in this coming fall of this year. There's also this community group that's growing called Cambridge H.E.A.R.T. And H.E.A.R.T. is an acronym for Holistic Emergency Alternative Response Team. They've been getting training from members of the community to be responders for mental health calls, and they're trying to get a contract with the city to respond to mental health calls. I spoke with Stephanie Guirand of Cambridge H.E.A.R.T. She couldn't comment directly on the case of Sayed Faisal, the 20-year-old who was shot by Cambridge police last month because she said she wasn't familiar enough with the details. But she did say this. Stephanie Guirand, pre-recorded: If there was a history of crises, then we would want to do regular check-ins with the family and create a care plan and develop trust with everyone in the family so that, in a moment of crisis, the person in crisis would be seeing familiar faces \u2014 which would automatically de-escalate the situation. LeMoult: So she said a key element of their plan is to work with people to prevent crises from happening to begin with. I also talked with Cambridge City Councilor Marc McGovern. He's actually a clinical social worker and he was the co-chair of that city task force that made the recommendations. He said, even if they had the new department in place and if they had a partnership with Cambridge H.E.A.R.T., there almost certainly would have been a police response in the case of Sayed Faisal, because he had a knife. But he said, hopefully, there would have also been a mental health professional that responded. Marc McGovern, pre-recorded: And then you hope that the mental health professional can take the lead and de-escalate the situation in such a way that the police aren't needed. But I don't know of any program that doesn't respond with the police if there is a weapon involved. Rath: Craig, as you mentioned, it's not just Cambridge. City officials in Boston also have been trying to figure out how to change response to mental health calls, right? LeMoult: Yeah, And in a lot of ways, they're further along with this. I spoke with Boston Police Superintendent Lanita Cullinane, who's the chief of the Bureau of Field Services, and she said the BPD has a mental health clinician in each precinct \u2014 or at least they're supposed to, they're currently looking to hire a few. It's interesting, those clinicians come from outside the police department. They're actually from Boston Medical Center. The team is called BEST, which is another acronym. It stands for Boston Emergency Services Team. And they've been doing this for years. Here's Superintendent Cullinane. Lanita Cullinane, pre-recorded: The clinicians, while they do respond to calls, they also follow up and offer additional services after they respond to calls \u2014 or even on calls that they haven't responded to, they will reach out to individuals to offer services. LeMoult: She noted, in cases where a weapon is present, that clinicians do stay back. But she said, they're still involved. One other thing: the police cars that have these mental health clinicians are not reserved just for calls with a mental health component. They can get dispatched to other calls and potentially be unavailable if a call comes in. Superintendent Cullinane said they can pull from one of the other districts if necessary.But in August of 2021, when Kim Janey was acting mayor of Boston, she announced a plan to expand the program by changing that. Kim Janey, pre-recorded: The pilot initiative will dedicate core response cars to calls likely to have a mental health concern so that we are making these mental health teams available for the calls that would benefit from their presence the most. LeMoult: That was a year and a half ago and that pilot never happened. Those cars still are not reserved just for mental health calls. Rath: It's already the case that not just police can respond to mental health calls, right? Don't EMS sometimes show up a lot of the time when, say, there's a 911 call about someone having a mental health emergency?LeMoult: That's right. In fact, unless there's a criminal action involved, mental health 911 calls in Boston go to EMS. And Boston EMS is also piloting some new approaches to these kind of calls. First of all, there's a pilot underway now where someone who calls 911 experiencing a mental health issue could have the opportunity to be connected by phone to a mental health clinician from that so-called BEST team from Boston Medical Center. I spoke with Dr. Sophia Dyer, who's the medical director for Boston EMS. Sophia Dyer, pre-recorded: And then they work with the mental health clinician that they're speaking to about what the best next step is. And sometimes that next step is, they do need an ambulance and do need to go to the emergency department. Sometimes that step is other resources, other follow-up. LeMoult: As I said, that's just a pilot, and it's not available all day right now \u2014 those clinicians are currently available for about 8 hours a day. But Dyer told me about another pilot that Boston EMS plans to launch in the late spring of this year that would pair Boston EMTs with those mental health clinicians when they go out and respond to mental health calls. That's one of the things that Acting Mayor Kim Janey announced a year and a half ago. It's actually getting started in this spring with two response vehicles. Rath: It sounds them like co-response programs for mental health calls are starting to gain some traction. LeMoult: Yeah, you know, I spoke more broadly about these kinds of programs with Melissa Morabito. She's an associate professor at UMass Lowell School of Criminology and Justice Studies, and she studies these kind of programs. And she said Massachusetts has been at the forefront of the co-response movement. She said it was significant the Boston PD had made this part of their operating budget. It initially just been grant funded. You know, there's a program in Framingham that our GBH colleague Marilyn Schairer did a story about last year, and Morabito said Lowell is just starting a program. And she pointed out, as we've been talking about here, that there are a lot of different kinds of alternatives to just sending police to respond to a mental health call. Melissa Morabito, pre-recorded: I think that there's lots of places to kind of chip away at the margins and reduce the police footprint, but I don't think it's a quick decision. It's a slow process, and I think that there are lots of different alternative responses. I don't know that you can have one alternative response that's going to do all the things. LeMoult: And she really emphasized there needs to be more focus on increasing access to mental health care in the state so it doesn't get to a point of crisis. And, you know, Massachusetts is taking steps in that direction. I mean, just yesterday, you and I talked about the new 25 community behavioral health centers that opened around the state, although those are mostly just available now for people on the state's Medicaid system.So certainly it could be argued the state is making some progress in this regard, but there's still clearly a ways to go.

        "body": "Updated at 10:01 a.m. March 16SeparatorWater utility experts in New England say meeting new EPA standards for PFAS in drinking water will be costly and could take years to achieve.The EPA proposed new national standards on Tuesday for the so-called \"forever chemicals\" that are more strict than those already set by the state. Public water utilities in Massachusetts are required to regulate six PFAS chemicals at 20 parts per trillion. The new federal regulations would limit six PFAS chemicals \u2014 including two that are different from what state regulations cover \u2014 to four parts per trillion.\"Lowering that to four is definitely going to trigger violations for a lot more communities across the entire country,\" said Kirsten King, executive director of the New England Water Works Association. \"And that's simply because PFAS is absolutely everywhere.\" Installing systems to filter out those chemicals is no small feat, said Don Bunker, the New England Water Works Association's deputy director.\"We're talking probably in the millions of dollars [per facility], depending on the size and depending on what already exists,\" Bunker said. \"Depending on the size of the utility, we can be talking filters that are 10 to 12 feet diameter, 20 feet tall, and you may need six of them. It's a building. It's not just a couple of things under your sink. And so that's going to take time to design, permit install, get up and running.\"And with water systems around the country needing to upgrade or install filtration systems at the same time, there are likely to be significant supply chain challenges on the necessary equipment, Bunker said.\"There's only so many manufacturers and places where this can come from,\" Bunker said. \"So how are all of these utilities now all at once going to be able to meet the timeline and put these [filtration systems] in?\" According to the Massachusetts Water Works Association, 170 public water systems in the state are currently working to address PFAS contamination, and more would likely need to install expensive filtration systems or find new water sources given the proposed federal standards.\"We're suspecting that there'll be a good number of water systems who will now have to move forward with treatment or finding an alternative source, given that the standard is going to be set at four parts per trillion,\" said Jennifer Pederson, executive director of the Massachusetts Water Works Association.Most PFAS treatment is being funded through loans managed by the Massachusetts Clean Water Trust, Pederson explained.\"But it is a loan and it's not a grant. It needs to be paid back by the ratepayers in the communities,\" Pederson said. \"Certainly we want to provide high quality water, but the expense is enormous. And and so we are mindful that it will fall to our ratepayers to fund that expense.\"Last month, the Biden administration announced $38 million from the federal infrastructure law would go to Massachusetts for addressing PFAS contamination. But experts said that funding won't cover what needs to be done.\"It doesn't even remotely come close to touching the amount of money that's going to be needed in order to install the treatment systems,\" King said.In some cases, including near military bases that were responsible for contaminating groundwater, remediation has been paid for by those responsible for releasing PFAS. But Pederson said the source of the contamination often remains unknown.\"I think the problem we are seeing in Massachusetts is that we have so many detections right now,\" she explained. \"You know, we are at 170 public water systems \u2014 DEP hasn't had the capacity on the waste site cleanup side to follow up with all of those detections and try to find a responsible party.\"Last May, in an effort to secure cleanup money, Massachusetts joined a multistate lawsuit against more than a dozen manufacturers of firefighting foams that contain PFAS.For some local water systems, a more affordable option might be finding alternative, uncontaminated water sources. So far, the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority system, which serves 61 communities in the Boston metro area, has not detected PFAS, said Fred Laskey, MWRA's executive director. \"Or if we do, it's very small trace amounts that are barely measurable,\" Laskey said, adding that the MWRA has the capacity to add more communities to its system.\"We're just watching closely to see how that develops with communities who do have PFAS who are close enough to us to to make a connection,\" Laskey said. \"Some people want to maintain their independence. We understand that. Others want to take a look at the MWRA and our water and the value of it. It's great water.\" SeparatorCorrection: This story was updated to correct the spelling of Fred Laskey's name.",

        "body": "Updated March 15 at 4:13 p.m.State officials agreed Wednesday to move forward with an $85 million project to make safety repairs to the Allston I-90 viaduct, despite local opposition that further highway investments might delay eventual plans to replace the traffic-heavy bridge.The repairs will target places where the aging bridge near Boston University has structurally deteriorated, replacing its existing concrete overlay, broken and corroding deck joints, and some of the bridge's barrier railings. The Mass. Department of Transportation feels it is important to begin making these \"critical\" improvements as soon as possible, said MassDOT civil engineer Michael O'Dowd.\"Based upon the ongoing investigations and inspections that we've been doing out there, we feel it is in the best interest of the agency to move forward with this interim repair contract to identify, not only identify, but to address, more importantly, to address and repair some of the steel deterioration we've seen out there. In some instances it's critical,\" O'Dowd said at a MassDOT board meeting on Wednesday.The board voted 7-1 in favor of the project, with Tim King voting against the contract to move forward with the repairs.King voted in opposition after local advocates spoke during the meeting's public comment period that there had not been enough communication with Allston stakeholders. Members of the public added that it didn't make sense to repair the viaduct the state is preparing to remove, and worried that investing in the bridge would cause delays to its eventual removal and replacement with a more transit- and walking-friendly area.\"Honestly, no one really understands what MassDOT is doing with this repair project, and why you're seeking to spend $100 million to repair a viaduct you're also planning on tearing down in just a few years,\" said Allston resident Harry Madison, a member of the I-90 Allston Task Force.The contract granted to J.F. White Contracting is for $71.6 million, though the total project cost with added funding for contingencies, traffic police and other services, is closer to $85.7 million.The engineers would begin with work underneath the bridge structure until April 2024, to avoid traffic disruptions along I-90. The total construction is estimated to take a little over three and a half years, with work directly on the highway and on the MBTA Commuter Rail performed during nighttime/off peak hours.The city of Boston and the state have long aimed to replace the aging highway bridge with two ground-level highways, to align rail tracks and build an MBTA/commuter rail station that would serve as a transit gateway to metro west, and to add a pedestrian boardwalk at roughly the same elevation next to the Charles River. It's been over a decade since discussions on the project started, and estimates of a nearly $2 billion cost would rely in large part on federal funding.The city and state jointly applied last fall for $1.19 billion in federal funding for the Allston Multimodal Project through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, but were unsuccessful. A MassDOT spokesperson said the department intends to pursue other grants.The MassDOT website for the multimodal redevelopment of the area includes an outdated timeline that says construction to replace the viaduct with the ground-level highways, rail and walkway will begin in the fourth quarter of 2023 or early 2024, and last six to 10 years. King said on Wednesday that the board has talked before about a 2045 completion date for the multimodal project. With repairs to the bridge now approved that will likely go into 2026, he said he understands local advocates' concerns about further delay.\"Today's proposal to fortify obsolete infrastructure will further delay the viaduct removal and is not a wise use of our public funds. For more than 60 years the viaduct has divided Allston's neighbors, separated us from the river and brought us the often untold damage of pollution, noise, and urban decay. And as this section of the Turnpike is approaching the end of its life, we ask that the DOT not shore up mistakes of the past,\" Glane Mook, executive director of MassBike and member of the Allston I-90 Task Force, said during public comment.The contract approved on Wednesday allows MassDOT to make changes to the scope of the work at any time, highway administrator Jonathan Gulliver said.The highway department is currently reviewing proposals sent by stakeholder engineering groups that draft an alternative construction schedule and plan, which may allow for earlier removal of the Allston viaduct, Gulliver said. The department received these proposals a few weeks ago, he said, and plans to provide an update to the board at its May meeting about possible contract changes that would allow them to make necessary repairs while not delaying future redevelopment.Though King encouraged the board to wait to approve the contract until these news plans could be considered by the department and board, O'Dowd said there was not time to wait until May and lose a few months of Boston's construction season on such critical safety repairs.\"This is, as you've heard, a preservation project. And I just want to be very clear, when we say preservation, that is an industry term to describe these types of projects,\" Gulliver said. \"When we say preservation in this case, it should not be thought of as preserving the viaduct indefinitely, that is not the intent. What it should be thought of is we are preserving the safe, structural capacity of the viaduct so that it can get to that next stage where it can do that large multimodal project.\"This story was updated with an expanded writeup from State House News Service.",

        "body": "The COVID-19 public health emergency in Massachusetts and the vaccine mandate for more than 40,000 state workers will both end on May 11, Gov. Maura Healey announced Wednesday. The emergency status, which was declared on May 28, 2021, let the state's public health commissioner take actions to support COVID-19 testing and vaccination, protect higher-risk populations, continue surveillance of the virus and otherwise respond to outbreaks. The May 11 date aligns with the expiration of the federal emergency declaration. \u201cThree years on from the start of the pandemic, we are now in a very different place,\u201d state Health and Human Services Secretary Kate Walsh said in a statement. \u201cWhile we will continue living with COVID-19, we can now incorporate the tools to manage this virus into our standing response to respiratory illness within our communities and healthcare system.\u201d Former Gov. Charlie Baker declared a state of emergency around COVID-19 in March 2020. As vaccines became available to broader swaths of the public in spring 2021, he lifted many restrictions, shifting the state to the more narrow public health emergency status it's been operating under since then. In concert with the end of the state and federal emergencies, Healey plans to rescind an executive order, issued by Baker, that required tens of thousands of workers in the state\u2019s executive branch agencies to be vaccinated against COVID-19. That order, Healey's office said, helped boost the vaccination rate among those employees from around 76% to more than 99%. It also sparked a legal challenge from the union representing state troopers. In a statement Wednesday, the State Police Association of Massachusetts thanked Healey for her plans to lift the mandate and said 20 of its members had been either fired or suspended without pay because of \"sincerely held religious beliefs that stop them from receiving a COVID-19 vaccination.\"Certain workers will still be subject to vaccine mandates under rules from the state Executive Office of Health and Human Services and the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Healey\u2019s office said.Healey also said she\u2019ll file a bill that would let health care organizations keep some flexibilities allowed during the emergency, particularly around staffing.Healey\u2019s announcement comes three years to the day after Baker, as part of the state\u2019s initial response to the unfolding pandemic, issued an unprecedented series of orders closing schools for three weeks, banning most gatherings of more than 25 people and prohibiting on-site dining at restaurants.",

        "body": "In 2016, Matthew Tottenham, was transported in chains from his cell at the Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center to the state\u2019s Lemuel Shattuck Hospital for foot surgery \u2014 performed by orthopedic surgeon Adriana Carrillo.Tottenham \u2014 now 35 years old \u2014 says he\u2019d been told by his surgeon that he was going to have a simple procedure to remove bone spurs. But while he was under anesthesia, he says she did a second procedure on his foot that he did not learn about until months later. He says he woke up in mind-numbing pain and was sent back to prison in a wheelchair. For months, he says, his foot was infected, swollen and burning with pain. He begged prison officials, and Carrillo, for additional care, he says, and even clean bandages, but was rebuffed. Two months later, he required an emergency surgery to quell the infection.Now Tottenham, recently released from prison, says he\u2019s never fully recovered, walks to avoid weight on his foot and still suffers from chronic pain. \u201cShe assaulted me and then treated me as if I was nothing,\u201d Tottenham told GBH News in a wide-ranging interview earlier this month. \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t be able to operate on prisoners.\u201dFor several years, Tottenham has been trying to hold Carrillo accountable for what he calls medical negligence. He is one of at least 20 people \u2014 most, if not all, current and former prisoners \u2014 who have filed lawsuits against her in state and federal courts over the last 15 years, an investigation by the GBH News Center for Investigative Reporting has found. Plaintiffs have alleged medical malpractice, botched surgeries \u2014 some done without their consent \u2014 as well as denial of adequate post-operative care and indifference. In interviews and court records, former patients say that in the wake of their treatment, their hands shake, they walk with a permanent limp or are in chronic pain because of what they describe as failed procedures or lack of follow-up. Carrillo couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. Her attorney John Cassidy told GBH News that a doctor should not be judged on the number of lawsuits they\u2019ve received, especially when filed by prisoners, most of them without attorneys. He said the legal actions are without merit and she\u2019s never lost a case. He said she can\u2019t be responsible for what happens when incarcerated patients return to their prison cells. \u201cDr. Carrillo really should be praised and not criticized,\u201d he told GBH News on Tuesday. \u201cShe\u2019s a careful, thoughtful surgeon. She\u2019s doing work that most surgeons are unwilling to do, at least in part because prisoners are notoriously litigious.\u201dMost lawsuits have been dismissed before getting to a jury, when prisoners were unable to prove their allegations, often lacking medical experts and lawyers to represent them. A handful, like Tottenham\u2019s, are still winding their way through the court system. But prisoners, their advocates and even some former Shattuck health practitioners say the complaints point to not only a rogue doctor but also a struggling public health system. In its care are some of the state\u2019s poorest patients, including prisoners, people experiencing homelessness and people with mental illnesses. Many argue prisoners \u2014 with few resources, often trying to pursue their legal fights from inside their prison cells \u2014 face an uphill battle to hold a doctor accountable. And, generally, prisons offer little choice about where prisoners receive medical care. Most often, those who need care outside their facility are treated at the Shattuck \u2014 a place that some former staff say was so poorly managed that they were unable to provide adequate care. They say, too, that the systems built to keep the hospital in check \u2014 a state board, state health officials and, more broadly, the justice system \u2014 fail to protect the vulnerable population. Elizabeth Matos, executive director of the nonprofit Prisoners\u2019 Legal Services, says her staff has been so concerned about Carrillo\u2019s treatment of patients that they maintain a spreadsheet of complaints, worry about a call from the next alleged victim, and have repeatedly reached out to prison officials and health care providers about their concerns.\u201cShe stands out in pretty serious botched surgeries that made people permanently disabled,\u201d Matos told GBH News. \u201cThis is, of course, something that should have been addressed by the department and by the health care provider already. It\u2019s not something that wasn\u2019t known to the system.\u201d Reporters from the GBH News Center for Investigative Reporting worked with student journalists at Boston University for months to examine allegations of wrongdoing at the Shattuck, poring through court records and state medical complaints as well as interviewing former and current prisoners and concerned medical staff, many of whom have left the hospital. Dr. Catharina Armstrong, a former Shattuck employee, told GBH News that Carrillo is not only a \u201cdangerous surgeon\u201d but lacks compassion and treats prisoners with disdain. Armstrong says she reported her concerns to management years ago but nothing was done. She resigned in 2019 from her post as chief of infectious diseases amid wider concerns about care and staffing at the hospital. Armstrong says she\u2019s appalled Carrillo is still working there.\u201cIt\u2019s a travesty in medical care,\u201d Armstrong said during a recent interview with other concerned former Shattuck doctors. \u201c[Many patients] had more deficits than when they went into the operation. And they were never rectified. And many patients would refuse to ever be seen by her again.\u201dOfficials from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health say that there\u2019s been \u201cno formal patient complaints filed with the Shattuck\u201d related to Carrillo. The lawsuits against her are not surprising, officials said in a written response to GBH News. \u201cYou would expect Dr. Carrillo to have greater exposure to malpractice claims based simply on the number of orthopedic procedures performed as orthopedic procedures generally have a higher rate for malpractice claims,\" according to a written statement released by the department.Officials say Massachusetts \u201chas made significant improvements\u201d at all four state hospitals since 2020.\u201cShattuck has also strengthened oversight and accountability and bolstered its internal communications process to improve clinical decision-making,\u201d the spokesperson said in a written statement. \u201cThe hospital is deeply committed to treating every patient with dignity and respect. This includes recognizing that every patient has a right to decline our care, if they so choose.\u201dPrisoners are allowed to refuse treatment unless the situation is \u201clife threatening\u201d and requires the state to seek \u201ca court order for forced treatment,\u201d according to state policy records.Complaints about Carrillo\u2019s care, specifically, and the Shattuck in general are numerous, inside and outside the courtroom. Several prisoners described to GBH News what they claimed was negligent care, but said they didn\u2019t file suit because they didn\u2019t know how. Others \u2014 like Tottenham \u2014 have filed legal motions simply for the right to receive care at a different hospital.SeparatorHave a tip or a comment about care at the Shattuck hospital? Reach out to GBH Deputy Investigative Editor Jenifer McKim at jenifer_mckim@wgbh.org.SeparatorCurrent lawsuits include one by Epiphany Lazarre who is suing Carrillo in federal court, claiming that she administered steroid injections into his lower back in 2017 that left him essentially \u201cparalyzed.\u201d Lazarre arrived at the hospital with back pain and went back to prison in a wheelchair, court records show. He claims she failed to follow up, acting \u201cdeliberately indifferent\u201d to his needs. A judge in 2020 denied a request by Carrillo to dismiss the claim, finding Lazarre \u201chad plausibly alleged\u201d his claim of indifference and awarded him pro bono legal representation. The case is pending.In addition to court filings, Carrillo has been the subject of at least eight complaints filed with the state Board of Registration in Medicine since 2003, according to records obtained by GBH News through several public record requests. Some of these complaints replicated those in court suits. Some prisoners, like Tottenham, also filed complaints with the state board before filing a lawsuit. Similar to other cases, the board sought a response from Carrillo and then decided not to impose any punishment, instead leaving the complaint in the doctor\u2019s file.Tottenham first reached out to GBH News in a handwritten letter from prison, saying that the judges, board and hospital \u201ccover for her always.\u201d \u201cI have found out how crooked this system is, in favor of doctors who do unspeakable things and walk [scot-free] to continue to do it over and over,\u201d he wrote.State law requires the board to publish any reports of a malpractice payment online. Carrillo paid out one medical malpractice claim last year, according to her publicly available state profile. State officials say it was for $45,000 but declined to provide any more information. Cassidy, Carrillo\u2019s attorney, couldn\u2019t confirm the payout amount but said his client voluntarily paid out the claim after she cut into the wrong ankle of a patient and left a scar. \u201cThe surgery was started on the wrong ankle, a skin incision was made, it was recognized immediately,\u201d he said. Court records show Carrillo settled a second medical malpractice claim in 2013 in Springfield. But the state\u2019s online profile of Carrillo does not mention that case and officials told GBH News they had no information the settlement came with a payout.Andrew Meyer, a leading Boston medical malpractice attorney, says the state board has long been \u201cinept\u201d in living up to its mission to police doctors. The seven-member board, including five physicians, \u201cwas created in 1894 to protect the public health safety by setting standards for the practice of medicine,\u201d according to its website. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the funding, nor do they have the will or the desire to investigate these kind of claims,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cIn reality, the board of registration is a protection racket for doctors.\u201dState officials say the board maintains a \u201crobust\u201d public page with profiles of physicians, including malpractice claims against them, investigates all complaints and imposes discipline when necessary. The state has received 2,861 complaints between 2016 and 2020 and disciplined 261 physicians, officials say, with a range of punishments including reprimands, revocations and suspensions. \u201cPatient safety is of utmost importance to the Board of Registration in Medicine,\u201d a spokesperson for the Department of Public Health said in a written statement. The board \u201cfully investigates all complaints against physicians submitted by patients, family members, healthcare facilities and other healthcare providers and takes action as warranted to protect patients.\u201dMeyer says the number of lawsuits filed against Carrillo is cause for concern. He says for every person who files a complaint, there\u2019s likely 20 more that didn\u2019t feel empowered enough to state a claim. He compares it to red flags prompted by a driver with speeding tickets.\u201cIf you get stopped speeding once, it\u2019s maybe a mistake; two, three times, you\u2019re probably on the edge,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have seven or eight speeding tickets, you\u2019re probably speeding a lot and you probably have been violating the law.\u201dBut winning medical malpractice suits is notoriously difficult, even for people outside the prison system. To succeed, a plaintiff must prove that a physician\u2019s actions were negligent and that negligence caused personal injuries. Those cases require expensive medical experts to support the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.To win a \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d claim in federal court, a prisoner needs to prove that a doctor\u2019s care was so \u201cclearly inadequate as to amount to a refusal to provide essential care at all,\u201d as a judge laid out last year when she dismissed one of the complaints against Carrillo. Meyer says the vast majority of cases that go to trial are won by doctors \u2014 and people without an attorney have little chance of success. \u201cThey are expensive, and they are difficult to bring,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why very few people even do it.\u201dCarrillo is seen as a \u201cworkhorse\u201d at the Shattuck, carrying out at least 10 or more procedures a week, according to Kathryn Noonan, a former Shattuck employee who served as director of information technology until last year. Noonan said she\u2019s not surprised by the number of lawsuits \u2014 which average just over one a year \u2014 particularly because of the number of procedures Carrillo performs. \u201cMost people sort of admired her work ethic, she saw a lot of patients,\u201d Noonan said. \u201cShe was very, very prolific.\u201d Carrillo graduated from the University of Javeriana Faculty of Medicine in Colombia in 1987, according to a state physician lookup site. There, she completed a residency in orthopedic surgery, completed in 1994, and then a second residency in physical medicine and rehabilitation at Boston Medical Center. She is not board certified as an orthopedic surgeon. Her attorney says that\u2019s because she did her training outside of the country. Certification is not required by law, but most major Boston hospitals told GBH News that they don\u2019t allow surgeons to work without it following several years of hire. Carrillo is not directly employed by the state but works for the Shattuck through an independent company called Orthopedic Trauma, P.C. She\u2019s also affiliated with the Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital in Milton through the same company. But a Beth Israel spokesperson says Carrillo is not qualified to practice at the hospital because of her lack of certification. Carrillo\u2019s lawyers have repeatedly defended her work in lawsuits as complying with the \u201cstandard of care\u201d required by physicians. Among those who lost their legal cases against her, state prisoner Treas Carter filed suit in 2011 claiming Carrillo \u201cfailed\u201d a hip surgery that left him with one leg two inches shorter than the other. Carter claims that he was permanently disabled and struggles with chronic pain. His case was dismissed after a judge denied his request for a pro bono attorney and he was unable to produce an expert witness to support his claim. \u201cNo attorney wants to take on a medical malpractice against a [Department of Correction] medical provider,\u201d Carter told GBH News in an email from prison earlier this month, saying the department\u2019s legal team is too well resourced and can drag out court cases. \u201cDr. Carrillo should be removed.\u201dThere\u2019s also state prisoner Joseph DeLong, who claims that Carrillo left metal in his knee during a 2016 surgery and then attempted to cover it up. DeLong \u2014 a stocky, muscular man who has spent most of his life in prison \u2014 says he exited surgery feeling much worse than when he went in, like a knife stabbing him at the spot he had been operated on. After months of complaints, Carrillo took X-rays and recommended that he get a full knee replacement. But when DeLong read his report, he realized the doctor had failed to give him a key piece of information: Carrillo had left metal fragments in his leg. A federal court judge found there was enough merit to DeLong\u2019s story to approve a pro bono attorney. The judge also awarded him money to hire an expert to better understand what happened to him.But the review wasn\u2019t what DeLong hoped for.The expert hired to examine the case reported in a letter to the attorney that Carrillo deviated from the standard of care by \u201cnot recognizing that a drill bit approximately 1.4 cm in length had broken off during the procedure.\u201d He also said that Carrillo erred when she \u201cfailed to observe, note and inform the patient of, or ignored, the presence of the foreign body on X-ray.\u201dHowever, the expert also concluded that the half-inch long piece of metal \u201cembedded in bone,\u201d was not the source of DeLong\u2019s suffering. DeLong disagrees. He maintains the excruciating pain in his knee occurred after the surgery. \u201cShe\u2019s a butcher, and she needs to be held to account,\u201d he said.In late February, a three-judge panel in the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court\u2019s decision to dismiss the case.DeLong wrote in an email from prison that he was disappointed by the decision. \u201cI tried to the best of my ability to have them held accountable for their wrongful conduct,\u201d he said. DeLong was so upset about his care at the Shattuck that he filed a legal motion to force the state to allow him to have a follow-up surgery on his knee at a private hospital.Advocates say it\u2019s next to impossible to get treatment elsewhere. DeLong says in his case, a sympathetic prison administrator helped him arrange for a full knee replacement at a different hospital \u2014 treatment he felt was like night and day.At the Shattuck, he said, \u201cthey treat you so inhumane that you literally feel like you\u2019re not a human being.\u201d The facility with roughly 250 beds is run by the state Department of Public Health in conjunction with the Department of Mental Health and the Department of Correction.Doctors who work there describe a sense of mission in caring for some of the poorest and most troubled patients in the state. But a group of former staff members \u2014 including Armstrong \u2014 say they left several years ago, deeply concerned about treatment of patients and worried about retribution from administrative leadership if they spoke up.\u201cI do believe there is a feeling of bullying and retaliation if you do speak up for things that would make the hospital look bad or the administration look bad,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cAnd many people didn\u2019t speak up.\u201d Armstrong and two other former Shattuck physicians spoke with GBH News in early March in the hopes of shining a light on the facility, one that they all dedicated many years of their lives to. They said they did speak up \u2014 but felt they weren\u2019t heard. In 2019, after Armstrong left, a group of employees sent a letter to Monica Bharel, then-commissioner of the Department of Public Health, detailing complaints including \u201cunsafe staffing\u201d and a \u201cpunitive\u201d work environment. \u201cThis is a plea from the majority of Shattuck Hospital staff for a reexamination of the hostile and toxic work environment,\u201d the letter said.The department met with staff, but doctors who spoke with GBH News say nothing changed. Medical personnel sent a follow-up letter in 2020 saying things had only gotten worse. \u201cWe believe that things have deteriorated significantly since our initial communication with the public health mission at Shattuck Hospital even more at risk than it was six months ago,\u201d they wrote. Many staff members eventually left.Later that year, then-Chief Executive Officer Joel Skolnick resigned. While some say he resigned under pressure, Skolnick told GBH News he left on his own accord. He defended his leadership and said many of the medical personnel who departed were not sufficiently dedicated to the hospital\u2019s mission. \u201cThe physicians, even though some of them were very good, weren\u2019t showing up, they weren\u2019t writing in the patient records,\u201d Skolnick said.State officials say the physician complaints were investigated and \u201cresolved.\u201d They also noted that another group of doctors sent a 2019 letter in support of new leadership. But Dr. Salah Alrakawi, who headed the residency program at the Shattuck before leaving in 2020 after 23 years in the system, is dubious that improvements were made. \u201cWe completely lost trust in the system, that there\u2019s any transparency in the system and there\u2019s any real investigation or holding people accountable,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was really no action that shows that someone is taking our complaint seriously.\u201d Dr. Jack Cadigan, who left his post as chief of cardiology in 2020, says he\u2019s proud of his work at the Shattuck but left because the environment became too difficult to continue. \u201cSome of the finest doctors I know left the facility \u2014 and they could work anywhere.\u201d They also said there are many health practitioners still there who need support. \u201cWhy is Dr. Carrillo continuing to operate when she is causing such damage?\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cWhy is there not more oversight with the needs of the hospital? Why? Why are we not being heard?\u201dComplaints from prisoners focus on the hospital\u2019s correctional unit located on the Shattuck\u2019s eighth floor. It\u2019s a medium security unit operated in conjunction with the Department of Correction, at an annual cost per person of about $436,000, according to a recently released state report. About 17 people generally are treated there each day.Tottenham didn\u2019t sue only Carrillo. Like many plaintiffs, he names a list of defendants, including prison staff and medical personnel. But he told GBH News that it was his treatment by Carrillo that prompted him to file suit, writing out his claim by hand from his prison cell. The tall, tattoo-covered man says it wasn\u2019t until two months after his surgery that he learned Carrillo had performed a second procedure on his foot \u2014 a bunionectomy \u2014 that he hadn\u2019t approved or been aware of. He says he also read in his medical records that Carrillo claimed he later had mishandled his bandages, which may have contributed to his poor recovery.\u201cI felt betrayed when I got my medical records,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are not going to treat me like a dog and then blame me.\u201dCarrillo says in court records that when he signed his consent forms, he understood \u201cthat conditions may develop during the procedure which would require modifying or extending\u201d the scope of the surgery. She says she performed the surgeries \u201cconsistent with the standard of care applicable to the average qualified orthopedic surgeon in 2016.\u201dIn 2018, a three-member Medical Malpractice Tribunal ruled in Tottenham\u2019s favor, a key step to a case moving forward. But in June, a Suffolk Superior Court Judge dismissed his case, claiming he hadn\u2019t been able to prove his claims with the help of an expert witness or had taken a deposition of Carrillo.Tottenham says he wasn\u2019t able to access X-rays of his foot or arrange a deposition of Carrillo from his prison cell. He is preparing his appeal from his temporary housing in a motel room in Connecticut, set up with a new printer and a computer gifted by a family member. He\u2019s hoping a new judge will support efforts to get him a pro bono attorney and funds to hire an expert.\u201cI went to prison. I didn\u2019t sign up for torture,\u201d he said. \u201cI gave them consent to do the surgery that she explained, and she did another surgery which resulted in the altering of my entire life.\u201dResearch for this story was launched in a Boston University College of Communication investigative journalism class.

        "body": "Idella Hazard can tick through one memory after another of bizarre moments from weekly Worcester City Council meetings. There have been times when speakers have cursed out counselors. And when the mayor has threatened to have people arrested for speaking too long during the public comment period. Last year, councilors debated international nuclear weapon disarmament. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the heck that has to do with the city of Worcester,\u201d said Hazard, who\u2019s been regularly watching the city council meetings for more than four decades. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019ve sat there a couple times laughing out loud and getting dirty looks from a couple of the councilors and the mayor.\u201d She\u2019s far from alone. Local journalist Bill Shaner calls himself the \u201cJane Goodall of the Worcester City Council\u201d and organizes weekly council watch parties.\u201cI kind of like to default to watching it like a reality show,\u201d Shaner said. \u201cJust sort of see the humor in all of it.\u201d Traditionally, council meetings like Worcester\u2019s are a way elected officials in Massachusetts cities and towns oversee local operations and pass new policies and laws. But Worcester\u2019s meetings are unique because they can be an unpredictable spectacle. They often run for at least three hours and can involve long discussions about trash and rats, passive-aggressive barbs between councilors, and votes on issues as minute as whether to place a single accessible parking spot in front of an apartment complex.\u201cIt could become a mess, a chaotic mess at any turn,\u201d Councilor Thu Nguyen said. \u201cThere\u2019s meetings where I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh this is going to be a 45-minute meeting.\u2019 And the next thing you know, it\u2019s three hours.\u201dThe cast and characters of the \u201creality show\u201d include all 10 councilors, the mayor, city manager and city clerk, along with guest stars from the public. Although the drama during the meetings sometimes involves more significant issues like housing or policing, it more often arises from drawn-out discussions of minute problems that impact small groups of people. Take the story of the Indian Lake watercraft ban. People with homes along the lake asked councilors to ban motorized boats and personal vessels, like Jet Skis, in 2021. And they did. When the ban came back up for renewal a year later, a city council subcommittee recommended councilors continue it. Instead, councilors delayed a vote on the issue using a procedural maneuver known as a hold. They then engaged in an hours-long debate over two meetings on the ban, which eventually passed 9-1. \u201cPeople hold a lot of things and it just prolongs things,\u201d Councilor Sean Rose said. \u201cThat can be frustrating.\u201dAnother common practice that takes up time? Shaner and Hazard said councilors constantly repeat each other during debates \u2014 even if they agree on the issue.\u201cThere's no way of knowing which item is going to be one of the items where everyone has to speak on it,\u201d Shaner said. \u201cThere's a tendency for Worcester City Council to see themselves as deserving of the limelight that the position affords \u2014 that the point of the job is speech time.\u201d While the time spent on random, less significant issues can be a form of theater for residents watching, Nguyen and Rose said the meetings take a toll. Nguyen, a first-term councilor in their second year, has suffered from anxiety as a result of the unpredictability of meetings each week. The councilor usually tries to manage through the meetings with coffee, chocolate or gummy bears. \u201cIt gets tiring,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to focus. Sometimes I just start doodling.\u201d Rose added when he first joined City Council about six years ago, he was so excited for the meetings that he ran into City Hall for them. Now, it\u2019s more like a slow \u201cArmy crawl,\u201d he said.Worcester councilors and officials attribute the length and unpredictability of the meetings in part to Worcester\u2019s form of government. Unlike Boston and dozens of other cities where a mayor is in charge of all operations, a city manager is the chief executive in Worcester. City councilors and the mayor hire and oversee the manager.However, Rose said because council positions are part-time and councilors share just one full-time staff member, they have little time and assistance to supervise the city manager on a day-to-day basis. As a result, city council meetings are a main opportunity to seek information from the manager on mundane issues like pothole repairs and snowplowing. For comparison, city councilors in Cambridge and Springfield are also part-time positions, but both councils have more people working for them. The staff help the councils keep in regular touch with city leaders about municipal operations, letting councilors focus more on bigger policy issues during meetings. \u201c[Meetings are] always extremely efficient,\u201d Springfield City Clerk Gladys Oyola-Lopez said. \u201cThere\u2019s always real work that\u2019s getting done. \u2026 For [Worcester\u2019s] council to not have a dedicated staff, that would be a huge problem.\u201d Worcester City Clerk Niko Vangjeli has looked into staffing in other municipalities at the City Council's request as a step toward possibly hiring additional staff. However, the council has yet to take action on the information. Some Worcester city officials and watchdogs say there are benefits to councilors meeting so often and discussing such a wide range of issues. David Rushford, who spent 37 years as Worcester\u2019s city clerk before retiring, said the meetings help make the city\u2019s government process more transparent. Still, he added that modifications other than hiring more staff may be necessary to help City Council meetings run smoother. He suggested councilors go along with subcommittee votes more regularly. Each committee consists of a different group of councilors. Too often, Rushford said, the council holds long debates on issues that a committee has already discussed and made a recommendation on \u2014 like the Indian Lake watercraft band. \u201cThe rules are [that subcommittee] is where the work is done,\u201d Rushford said. \u201cIf the councilors are routinely taking up items in council that were already handled in committee, then they're making life miserable for themselves.\u201d Idella Hazard, the longtime City Council watchdog, would appreciate more efficient council meetings. She values City Council as an essential party of democracy, and she walks 15 minutes from home to City Hall every Tuesday to send a message to councilors that the public is watching them. But sometimes she fantasizes about doing something else on a Tuesday night. \u201cI would go to the library and do some arts and crafts there,\u201d she said, adding that attending meetings every week is \u201cexhausting.\u201d",

        "body": "Massachusetts will need to find another 30,000 home health aides and personal care aides to support the increase in Alzheimer\u2019s patients expected by the end of the decade, according to the latest yearly report from the Alzheimer\u2019s Association released Wednesday. The latest data show there are about 110,000 home health aides and personal care aides in the state, and about twice as many unpaid caregivers supporting this growing population. Jim Wessler, the CEO for the Massachusetts/New Hampshire chapter of the Alzheimer's Association, said that almost 30% increased need for aides by 2030 comes on top of a current staffing shortage exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, when a number of long-term care workers left the profession.\u201cSome of them just decided, \u2018I'm not going to do this anymore,\u2019 because it was just too overwhelming, and they have their own families they have to take care of,\u201d Wessler said. \u201cSo we have critical shortages today in nursing homes and assisted living. And we see that with hospitals having patients backed up that they can't place in long-term care facilities because long-term care facilities don't have beds, because they don't have enough staffing.\u201dThe report also projects that by 2050, Massachusetts will need 1,042 geriatricians \u2014 primary care doctors with additional specialized training to treat older patients \u2014 to serve 30% of its residents who will be 65 and older, regardless of whether they have dementia or not. At last count in 2021, there were only 214 geriatricians in the state.Wessler added that, right now, Massachusetts is facing \u201ca really dramatic shortage of specialists like neurologists and geriatricians in particular.\u201dAnastasia Canell, a doctoral candidate in counseling psychology with a focus in geriatrics at Lehigh University who is doing her residency in Massachusetts, recognizes the need for more specialists from her own experiences. Her grandmother had risk factors for vascular dementia but was not diagnosed until after the family noticed behavioral changes and contacted a neurologist. Now she wants to normalize the process for other families.\u201cI honestly think about that every time before I go into a room with the family,\u201d said Canell, who also does legislative advocacy work with the Alzheimer\u2019s Association in the state. \u201cI think about what would my family have needed in this moment? What would my family have benefited from? What kind of person would make this experience more comfortable?\u201dWessler said addressing the doctor shortage is particularly urgent with the recent accelerated approval by the FDA in January of lecanemab, only the second drug the agency has approved to treat Alzheimer\u2019s. If the medication is approved for Medicare coverage, doctors anticipate a rush in demand. Wessler said the Massachusetts/New Hampshire chapter of the Alzheimer\u2019s Association has a medical scientific advisory committee of specialists, including geriatricians, neurologists, neuropsychologists, from most of the major teaching hospitals in the state who have been meeting to prepare.\u201cHow are they going to handle what they anticipate will be an influx of demand for people to know if they're eligible for the treatment?\u201d Wessler said. \u201cAnd then another part of that is, how are we making sure that there is equity involved with this so that underserved communities are also getting access to the latest in treatment?\u201dWessler said equity is deeply embedded in diagnosis, treatment and outcomes with regard to Alzheimer\u2019s. He said national statistics show that African American people are twice as likely to get Alzheimer's and dementia as white people, and that Latino people are about one and a half times more likely to be diagnosed. He added that some of that increased risk is correlated to the disproportionate impact of heart disease in those communities.In Massachusetts, Wessler said his organization is working with several Community Health Centers to increase access to specialists, care aides and treatment for people of color and those with lower incomes.Equity is also an issue when it comes to meeting the projected needed increase of tens of thousands of care aides in Massachusetts.Marlishia Aho is the regional communications manager of 1199SEIU United Healthcare Workers East, a union representing over 80,000 health care and home care workers in the state. She echoed Wessler\u2019s perspective on the effects of the pandemic on the shortage of care workers \u201cIt has only exacerbated the shortage,\u201d Aho said. \u201cPrior to the pandemic, we have seen that certified nursing aides were leaving the field because they were \u2014 as majority women, and women of color and immigrants who weren't paid fairly \u2014 seen as essential, but their wages and benefits didn\u2019t mirror that.\u201dAho said, as of April 1, 58,000 personal care attendants they represent who are paid through MassHealth, the state\u2019s Medicaid program, will be making $18 an hour, which works out to less than $38,000 a year. And she said, with the healthcare industry \u201cjust churning through workers,\u201d she\u2019s skeptical that finding another 30,000 care aides to enter the field by 2030 is a reachable goal.\u201cIs it feasible? Not where we are currently,\u201d Aho said. \u201cNot with the wages we are providing to caregivers, but if we continue to invest in caregivers and listen to them, ensure they have a seat at the table, I think it is doable. But we have to value these roles because they are essential.\u201dAho added that recruiting and retaining care aides for those with dementia has a multiplying effect.\u201cThey allow other work to happen. So if I have someone caring for my elderly father, I am able to go out into the world and work. And so we have to think about it makes other work possible.\u201d",

        "body": "March Madness is here, with the best teams in men\u2019s and women\u2019s collegiate basketball facing off for the first time this season on Tuesday \u2014 and non-athletes getting into the game by filling out their brackets. Some are big basketball fans, like GBH\u2019s sports reporter Esteban Bustillos and Morning Edition co-host Paris Alston, and they\u2019re gearing up to crush officemates and friends with their brackets. Others, like GBH commentator Callie Crossley and Morning Edition co-host Jeremy Siegel, are feeling a bit lost. Here are Bustillos and Alston\u2019s tips for following the NCAA basketball tournaments.Massachusetts has one representative in the tournament: the Holy Cross women\u2019s team, which beat Boston University 66-61 in the Patriot League tournament to earn the spot. \u201cAfter that win, though, they\u2019ll be big underdogs,\u201d Bustillos said. \u201cThey'll be facing Maryland, the [No.] 2-seed in their region. This will be the Crusaders' just 13th appearance in the tournament, all time \u2014 last time coming in 2007 when they lost to Duke in the first round.\u201dHoly Cross does have one historical win on their program\u2019s record: 1991, when they beat Maryland in the first round, Bustillos said. Other New England teams to watch: UConn and Vermont are sending both men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams, and Providence is playing in the men\u2019s tournament. When filling out her bracket, keep in mind that upsets are less common. \u201cOut of the past 10 games, at least on the men\u2019s side, eight of the teams who won the title were No. 1 seeds,\u201d Alston said. Still, it\u2019s a good idea \u2014 and more fun \u2014 to allow room for some underdogs. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make room for a Cinderella team to happen,\u201d Alston said. \u201cA team that would make it further in the tournament than most people would expect. ... I always try to pick one of those to go pretty far.\u201dThose upsets are part of the magic of the tournament, Bustillos said. \u201cThe great thing about like March Madness versus, say, the NBA playoffs is that if you have to beat a team four times, you usually have to be the more skilled team,\u201d Bustillos said. \u201cAny team can beat any team at least one time, which makes the Cinderellas so great.\u201dAlston said she also looks at win-loss records, and digs deeper for teams with close records, reading articles about their performance earlier in the season. It also involves some guesswork, Bustillos said. \u201cHonestly, I think everybody's like, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s all the science,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut nobody really knows. It\u2019s a lot of guessing.\u201dBustillos said he has South Carolina winning the women\u2019s tournament, in part because of a local connection. \u201cWorcester Academy\u2019s own Aliyah Boston led them to the championship last year,\u201d Bustillos said. \u201cI think South Carolina is just \u2014 until I'm proven otherwise \u2014 they\u2019re the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me on the women\u2019s side.\u201dOn the men\u2019s side, Bustillos, who is from Texas, went with Houston, the No. 1 seed in their region. \u201cThey have the best overall record,\u201d he said. \u201cI just feel good about them, and they\u2019re a Texas team and that\u2019s all I need, really.\u201d",
