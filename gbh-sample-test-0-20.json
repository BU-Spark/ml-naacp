        "body": "Thomas White, a senior at Boston Latin School, is like a lot of high school athletes. A cross country runner, he trained hard all summer in hopes a season would happen.And, to his surprise, it did. But it wasn't without restrictions.\u201cThe state \u2026 didn\u2019t really know what was safe or not safe. So everything kept getting pushed back,\" said White's coach, Chris Blondin. \"And we were just praying that it wouldn\u2019t end up like the spring season where it outright got cancelled. So the fact that we even have a season at all is just a blessing.\u201dBut then, in the last week of October, Boston Public Schools postponed the few athletic activities it was allowing, essentially killing the BLS season. It's just one example of the dark hole that high school sports have been thrown into during the pandemic. And even for the sports and districts that are still going, a season can seem like a countdown to the inevitable postponement or cancellation. And for White, and other high school seniors like him, that uncertainty about what happens next may be the common refrain as they attempt to navigate through the haze of COVID-19.More from COVID And The ClassroomFor the full story, click on the audio player button above.

        "body": "A wave of blue votes could wash over the Massachusetts State House's small Republican caucus this election, but local political experts say that voters may be more than willing to keep conservatives on Beacon Hill even if most Bay Staters want to reject President Trump.Tuesday's election is expected to draw as many as 3.5 million Massachusetts ballots through the mail and in person, energized by Massachusetts voters' zeal to replace Trump, who lost to Hillary Clinton here 61 percent to 33 percent in 2016.Georgetown Republican Rep. Lenny Mirra knows what he's up against as he runs for a fourth term and that \"there are a lot of people that won't vote for Republicans because of Donald Trump.\"\"Even though a state legislator has nothing to do with the president, there are people that will say, no, you're on the 'red team' and Donald Trump is on the 'red team', therefore I'm not voting for you,\" Mirra told GBH News. \"There are people like that. There's a lot of people like that,\" he said.Stonehill College political scientist Peter Ubertaccio said the national political mood is not always a good barometer of what's happening at the local level and that Republicans that focus on the district and not the White House can survive Democratic challenges even when the winds are blowing against the GOP.\"Voters will make a distinction between a presidential candidate or president they don't like,\" Ubertaccio said, \"The work of a state legislator is so different than the way in which a president is perceived in a locality that they can, in fact, overcome.\"Trump will likely lose to Joe Biden throughout Massachusetts, but areas like Worcester and Barnstable County could show slimmer Democratic victory margins than the deepest blue precincts of the Commonwealth. On the Cape this year, Republicans are defending three contiguous seats from the bridges to Brewster that Democrats think they can pick up.Republican Rep. Randy Hunt's retirement from the Fifth Barnstable district leaves retired Yarmouth deputy police chief and Republican candidate Steven Xiarhos running to replace him on Beacon Hill against Democratic opponent Jim Dever, an attorney and Sandwich school committee member.Xiarhos has tied himself closer to President Trump than most Massachusetts Republicans, close enough in fact to have to quarantine after attending a White House function and possible COVID-19 outbreak in September.Ubertaccio thinks Xiarhos will have a harder time retaining Hunt's GOP seat as a newcomer than Rep. Will Crocker will have defending his Hyannis-based seat against Democrat Kip Diggs.\"There's an excellent chance that the Republicans keep the seat in Hyannis. But there's an equally good chance that they may lose it in Sandwich simply because they don't have an incumbent running for reelection and the calculation is very different in voters' minds,\" Ubertaccio said.Former Massachusetts Senate Minority Leader, and veteran of congressional and statewide campaigns, Richard Tisei agrees that any Republican \"sitting back and resting on your laurels\" is going to have a problem this election cycle.\"But if you've been out and you're connected to the community and you've been doing the work, if you're not taking anything for granted and you're running an aggressive campaign, I think you'll make it through whatever storm should be coming in November,\" Tisei told GBH News.If Republicans do lose any of the 13 seats the party is defending this cycle, not much may change in the Democrat-dominated House, where Speaker Robert DeLeo's caucus already has a 127-to-31 advantage.Democratic political strategist Jay Cincotti said an even slimmer Republican caucus emerging from 2020 with fewer moderates from \"purple\" districts would leave a leaner, meaner GOP.\"It probably does empower the extremes of the party with respect to the minority party in this case. So I think if you saw Democratic gains, I think we would see an emboldened extreme right sort of get more noisy,\" Cincotti said.A larger Democratic majority would make it easier for Democrats to override Gov. Charlie Baker's occasional veto, but by flipping vulnerable \"purple\" seats now held by Republicans into the Democratic column, DeLeo could find himself with a greater number of moderate members less willing to take on contentious progressive goals.A counterexample was what happened in the state Senate when it's GOP caucus shriveled to one-tenth of the chamber and Democrats used the super-majority to force a more progressive agenda than had been seen before.\"I think the increase of a Democratic majority will embolden the progressive to try to get louder and to advocate for their positions more aggressively,\" Cincotti said.However the election goes, Tisei is confident that the conservative message of Governors Baker, Jane Swift, Paul Cellucci and Bill Weld will be represented on Beacon Hill. Tisei called Republicans that hold Democratic-leaning seats \"above average to exceptional,\" in their political skill and bipartisanship.\"They're all superstars in their own right that they were able to get elected in Massachusetts in the first place,\" Tisei said.",

        "body": "Lauren Berglund\u2019s journey to voting this year began back in December, shortly after she moved from her home state of Iowa to Saint James, New York, a small hamlet on the north shore of Long Island about an hour from New York City. At the time, the 2020 election was almost a year away \u2014 but based on past experience, Berglund knew that she needed to start getting organized to vote early.That\u2019s because Berglund, who was born with a genetic condition causing significant vision loss, is legally blind. \u201cI wanted to be able to vote independently,\u201d she said, as she had done in previous elections in Iowa.So, she made an appointment at her local Department of Motor Vehicles to officially change her residency to New York, which would then allow her to register to vote in the state. That way, she could head to the polls in person and take advantage of the accessible voting machines required by law to be available at her local polling center. But then the coronavirus pandemic hit.With her DMV appointment cancelled indefinitely, Berglund reset her sights on voting by absentee ballot from her permanent address in Iowa, where she was already registered to vote. There was just one problem: Berglund is not able to read paper or fill in the bubbles that make up a typical mail-in ballot. Once her absentee ballot application arrived, she used an app on her phone to scan it and send it to her computer, where she used software to have the form read aloud back to her. She then converted the form to a fillable PDF so that she could complete the fields with the help of her computer. Then came the problem of sending the application back \u2014 which she had to do not once, but twice, as the first time there was a problem with her registration. Unable to drive, and weary of taking public transportation during the pandemic, she would need to arrange for a safe ride to the post office in order to drop off her application. She knew that would be a hassle to schedule and could also lead to  unwanted exposure to the virus, so she sent the first form back to her mother in Iowa, who walked it into her hometown\u2019s municipal office. A chance run-in with her local postal worker on the street outside her place saved her the second time, as she was able to give him the application directly.\u201cThankfully I had that choice, and someone to help, or this wouldn\u2019t have worked anyway,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really does take a village.\u201dAnd then, finally, her absentee ballot arrived from Iowa \u2014 complete with the bubbles, columns, and signature fields that are so common on most voting ballots.Using her scanning app, she was able to read the ballot, \u201cBut as I was filling it out, I couldn\u2019t tell if I was inside the bullets or not,\u201d she said. Mom to the rescue once again; Berglund FaceTimed her mother to help her read through the ballot and then guide her to fill out the bubbles next to her choices.\u201cI did the best I could,\u201d Berglund said. \u201cBut I did not get to vote independently or privately. Thankfully, I have similar [political] views to my mom, because she helped me fill out the entire thing.\u201dHer completed ballot finally in hand, Berglund knew she couldn't rely on running into her local postal worker again to send it back. So she risked a bus ride to the post office to drop it into the mail herself. After checking the online ballot tracker every single day afterward \u2014 \u201cthankfully, that part was accessible,\u201d she said \u2014 to make sure that it arrived in Iowa safe and sound, it finally came back showing that her ballot had been officially cast \u2014 and her voice officially heard.In the end, Berglund, who works for an organization that places guide dogs with veterans, first responders, and blind individuals, was frustrated by her voting experience, but also somewhat relieved that she didn\u2019t have to brave the polls in person. Due to a connective tissue disease, she is unable to stand comfortably for more than 15 minutes at a time. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the reports of lines that are three blocks long, and there is just no way,\u201d she said.She noted that it\u2019s more difficult for her to maintain the recommended six-feet of social distance because she can\u2019t see to accurately gauge the space between her and the people around her. In addition, her guide dog, Sami, is trained to head right for the door, not to wait in line. And the need for working in close contact with a sighted guide for assistance with the voting machines would have put her at additional risk of exposure for the virus. \u201cI can\u2019t see if someone is wearing a mask properly, so I just hope for the best,\u201d she said.And that\u2019s if the accessible voting machines were even setup and working properly, which Berglund has found in past experience isn\u2019t always the case.\u201cIt would not have been fun to go through all of the trouble to get [to the polls] and then be like \u2018oh shucks,\u2019\u201d without an accessible machine to vote on, she said.Despite the many challenges of voting this year \u2014 in fact, because of them \u2014 Berglund had a strong message for other voters, regardless of disability.\u201cDon\u2019t take your ability to vote easily for granted. Take advantage of it. If you can easily get out and vote, do it,\u201d she said. She also implored people to be kind to one another at the polls. \u201cIt could have taken a lot for some people just to get there,\u201d she said.Berglund\u2019s hope is that the heightened awareness of social injustices that has taken hold across the country will not stop once Election Day is over. \u201cPeople are thinking about things they haven\u2019t always been thinking about, especially when it comes to marginalized communities,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fight is ongoing and always will be.\"",

        "body": "It\u2019s unlikely Donald Trump will win Massachusetts this week, and even more unlikely likely he\u2019ll win Boston, where Hillary Clinton got 81 percent of the vote in 2016. But in one small pocket of the city, the odds of a Trump victory are actually pretty good.Maureen Feeney, the former Boston City Councilor and current city clerk, has lived in the area in question \u2014 Ward 16, Precinct 12 \u2014 for half a century. (On a map of Boston, it\u2019s the city\u2019s southeastern tip, right across the Neponset River from Quincy and Milton.) It is, Feeney says, a place where voting is a social event.\u201cYou\u2019d have cake sales from St. Brendan\u2019s grammar school, people talking and holding signs, giving jabs here and there,\u201d Feeney said. \u201cIt\u2019s just always been a critically important component of living in this neighborhood.\"In addition, Feeney says, 16-12 can feel like a world unto itself, where the same families living side by side for generations creates what feels like a small town in the midst of the city.\u201cSo many of the people who\u2019ve lived here have married or whatever and have bought their parents\u2019 house, or a neighbor\u2019s house,\u201d Feeney said. \u201cI see Brian and Stevie and Amanda and they\u2019re all bringing their kids \u2014 but they used to walk by my house when they were going to school.\u201d If you\u2019re an outsider and visit 16-12, you\u2019ll probably notice Florian Hall, the headquarters for the Boston Firefighters Union. The streets are full of single- and two-family homes with well-kept yards decked out for Halloween \u2014 not to mention a lot of American flags. Florian Hall, the headquarters of the Boston firefighter's union (side view)You might not see a single 'Donald Trump for President' sign. But that absence is deceptive.\u201c[Trump] didn\u2019t win a single precinct in Boston, but he came damn close in 16-12,\u201d said Yawu Miller, the senior editor of the Bay State Banner. \u201cHe got 46 percent of the vote.\u201dEvery election cycle, Miller studies Boston\u2019s election returns, looking for unusual results. And every election, 16-12 stands out. In 2017, for example, Mayor Marty Walsh crushed challenger Tito Jackson, winning a whopping 95 percent of the vote. And in 2018, when Rachael Rollins won the Democratic primary in the Suffolk County District Attorney\u2019s race, her push for criminal justice reform drew support citywide \u2014 but not here. \u201cShe received 20 votes,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAnd Greg Henning. the candidate who was backed by the police unions, received 360 votes.\u201dLarry DiCara, the former Boston City Councilor and mayoral candidate, says that outcome \u2014 and Trump\u2019s strong performance two years earlier \u2014 may reflect the fact that 16-12 is packed with residents who work in public safety. A homemade sign supporting police on Whitridge Street in Boston's Ward 16, Precinct 12\u201cIt\u2019s a neighborhood with a high percentage of people who are police and fire, and police have strongly supported Donald Trump,\u201d DiCara said. \u201cCertainly in the great debate about reforming the police department, and issues of liability, Donald Trump stands with the police, notwithstanding that generally, he\u2019s anathema to organized labor.\u201dMany firefighters are standing with the police during that debate, too \u2014 including their statewide union, the Professional Fire Fighters of Massachusetts, whose website laments \u201cunrelenting attacks\u201d on \u201cour Brothers and Sisters in blue.\u201dBut DiCara said he believes the roots of 16-12\u2019s unusual political identity go back further. He points to 1983, when Ronald Reagan stopped by the Eire Pub \u2014 a literal stone\u2019s throw from the precinct\u2019s northwestern corner \u2014 for a beer and some potent cultural symbolism. \u201cRonald Reagan was able to relate to white, middle-class people far better than any Republican had up to that time,\u201d DiCara said. \u201cThe Eire Pub visit was a real message that \u2018I\u2019m one of you folks, I\u2019m one of the guys! I\u2019ll have a cold one at the Eire!\u2019\u201d Back then, DiCara says, you could find precincts like 16-12 throughout the city.\u201cThese are churchgoing people,\u201d DiCara said. \u201cThe majority of them are white. The great majority of them are Irish. [They\u2019re] very set in their ways, and that includes politics.\u201dModuleNow, as affluent newcomers gentrify Boston, 16-12 has ceased to be representative. Instead, it\u2019s an outlier.Still, one big question remains: How could so many voters back Trump one year and Walsh, a vocal Trump critic, the very next?DiCara notes that when Walsh was a state represenative, 16-12 was part of his district.\u201cHe knows almost everyone in that precinct by first name,\u201d DiCara said of Walsh. \u201cHe knows when Johnny\u2019s going to graduate from B.C. High, or Mary\u2019s going to graduate from UMass Boston, or whatever the case might be.\u201dBut Miller has a different explanation. \u201cPeople used to say people would vote primarily on ethnicity in Boston, next on neighborhood \u2014 they\u2019d vote for somebody from the neighborhood regardless of their ethnicity \u2014 and ideology was like the last thing,\u201d Miller said. \u201cSo it was always more tribal.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s beginning to flip \u2026 almost everywhere, except that little section,\" he said. On Tuesday, as Boston\u2019s presidential results trickle in with what\u2019s likely to be a minimal amount of drama, that little section might just be a national bellwether, telling us if Trump\u2019s white, working-class support is as strong as it was four years ago.
