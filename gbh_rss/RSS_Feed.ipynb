He was 57. The Red Sox announced his death in a statement Sunday. Wakefield had brain cancer, according to ex-teammate Curt Schilling, who outed the illness on a podcast last week — drawing an outpouring of support for Wakefield. The Red Sox confirmed an illness at the time but did not elaborate, saying Wakefield had requested privacy. Drafted by the Pirates as a first baseman who set home run records in college, Wakefield converted to a pitcher after mastering the knuckleball in the minor leagues. Relying on the old-timey pitch that had largely fallen into disuse, he went on to win 200 major league games, including 186 with the Red Sox — behind only Cy Young and Roger Clemens in franchise history. But it was his role in the Red Sox-Yankees rivalry of the early 2000s that turned Wakefield into a fan favorite whose impact went far beyond his numbers. After New York rallied to tie Game 7 of the \\'03 AL Championship Series, Wakefield came on in relief in the 11th inning and Aaron Boone hit his first pitch for a walkoff home run to end Boston\\'s season and extend a World Series drought that stretched back to 1918. The following October, with the Red Sox season again at risk against the Yankees in the ALCS, Wakefield got nine outs in extra innings of Game 5, setting up David Ortiz to win it in the 14th. The Red Sox went on to complete their comeback from a three-games-to-none deficit and then sweep St. Louis in the World Series to claim their first championship in 86 years. \"He was a great competitor when he took that mound,\" former teammate Kevin Youkilis said on the broadcast of Sunday\\'s Red Sox game. \"He was just a great teammate and just a great friend. Had the luxury of playing with him on the field, in the booth, and just glad that I had the opportunity over the years to be alongside of him.\" The Red Sox, and Wakefield, won it all again in 2007. \"There were some years there where I didn\\'t know if I was going to come back or not,\" Wakefield said at his 2012 retirement news conference. \"But I\\'m very grateful that I\\'ve been able to put this uniform on for such a long time, and win two World Series for this great city.\" Wakefield was 11-3 when he made his only All-Star Game in 2009, becoming the second-oldest player — to Satchel Paige — ever selected to his first All-Star Game. Wakefield was the oldest player in baseball at 45 when he earned his 200th win in September 2011, retiring his final six batters. He announced his retirement the following spring training, seven wins short of breaking the franchise record for wins held by Clemens and Young. \"I\\'m still a competitor, but ultimately I think this is what\\'s best for the Red Sox,\" he said at the time. \"I think this is what\\'s best for my family. And to be honest with you, seven wins isn\\'t going to make me a different person or a better man. So, my family really needs me at home.\" An eighth-round Pittsburgh draft pick in 1988, Wakefield converted to a pitcher two years later in an effort to revive his chances of making the majors. He got his callup midway through the 1992 season and went 8-1, finishing third in the NL rookie of the year voting. He added two complete games in the NL playoffs — one in Game 6 to keep Pittsburgh alive. (He was voted the MVP of the Series late in Game 7, before the Atlanta Braves rallied to win on Francisco Cabrera\\'s single with two out in the bottom of the ninth.) But Wakefield was unable to recapture his success in his second year in Pittsburgh, going 6-11 with a 5.61 ERA. He was released by the Pirates after another trip through the minors, and signed six days later by the Red Sox. Wakefield again strung together a dominant run, starting 14-1 in 1995 before finishing the year at 16-8 with a 2.95 ERA. After 17 seasons with Boston, he retired as the franchise leader with 3,006 innings and 430 starts, and second in games and strikeouts. In all, he was 200-180 with a 4.41 ERA. Wakefield was also an eight-time nominee for the Roberto Clemente Award that goes to a ballplayer for exemplary sportsmanship and community involvement, winning it in 2010. \"Tim was more than just a versatile and reliable All-Star pitcher, a highly respected teammate, and a two-time World Series champion,\" baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement, citing \"the dedicated work he and his family did serving the communities of New England.\" After retiring, Wakefield became an analyst for Red Sox broadcasts and remained active in the team\\'s charities. \"Tim\\'s kindness and indomitable spirit were as legendary as his knuckleball,\" Red Sox owner John Henry said. \"He not only captivated us on the field but was the rare athlete whose legacy extended beyond the record books to the countless lives he touched with his warmth and genuine spirit. He had a remarkable ability to uplift, inspire, and connect with others in a way that showed us the true definition of greatness. He embodied the very best of what it means to be a member of the Boston Red Sox and his loss is felt deeply by all of us.\" Copyright 2023 NPR.

The Dolphin Rescue Center, located in Orleans and operated by the International Fund for Animal Welfare, plans to treat about twelve stranded dolphins and porpoises on the Cape each year. Before the facility opened up, rescue teams were operating in mobile clinics that could only hold the animals for a few hours, often not long enough to meet their needs. Now, dolphins will be able to receive care for up to four days, enough time to give many of them a fighting chance before being released back into the wild. GBH's All Things Considered host Arun Rath spoke with Sarah Sharp, a rescue animal veterinarian at the Dolphin Rescue Center about the work being done there. What follows is a lightly edited transcript.Rath: So as I mentioned, this is a first of its kind facility for dolphins. Tell us a bit more about why Cape Cod needs this kind of a clinic.Sharp: Absolutely. So Cape Cod, believe it or not, is actually a global hotspot for dolphin strandings. We see the highest frequency of dolphin mass strandings anywhere in the world. This little spit of land that sticks out into the Atlantic Ocean, we have a lot of dolphins that unfortunately get trapped there. So it gives us an incredible opportunity to actually be able to help these animals when they strand alive and to improve the medical care that they need and to put them back out into the wild as quickly as we can. But there are certainly a number of animals where their needs outmatch what we're able to provide in our mobile clinic right now, so this new dolphin rescue center gives us the opportunity to provide that added care that they need [along with] better diagnostics to be making sure that we're making the best decisions for these animals.Rath: So talk us through that process a little bit. What happens when you encounter a stranded animal up to the care point? What's different now about being able to have this long term care?Sharp: We are an organization that's always relied heavily on our volunteers, and so when we get a report of a stranded dolphin on Cape Cod, they're the first ones that we call to go out to the scene, find the animal and give us an update on the condition. When they confirm that it is a live dolphin, our rescue staff heads out in both our mobile clinic and our trucks to be able to access the animal. The animal is assessed in the field and we transport it using specialized stretchers into our mobile rescue clinic. We like to call it Moby for short. Once inside Moby, we can perform diagnostics on it. We can draw blood and run blood in-house there and do a full health assessment. We can do ultrasounds on these animals and find out from that information that we gain whether or not these animals are going to be good release candidates. If they are, then we take them to Provincetown and release them there, which gives us beach access to really deep water, very close to shore and access to good feeding habitats, basically where the whale watches go right off. So its great dolphin habitat, it gives those animals a good chance of survival. For the animals that are not quite healthy enough to be released immediately, those animals now will get a second chance, so they'll be able to come back with us. We'll transport them again in Moby to our dolphin rescue center in Orleans. There we will be able to admit them into one of our medical tanks and do better diagnostics on them, so we'll be able to get a better ultrasound in the pool there, and we'll be able to track their progress over a couple of days after receiving additional treatments to improve their condition. Then once they're ready and healthy enough to be released, we'll do essentially the same release process that we would have done with our other animals, release them back in Provincetown, back into the ocean.Rath: You know, these are obviously large and very strong animals, but the videos and photos that I've seen of the process, it doesn't seem like they're really resisting. Do you get a sense, and it's a strange question, that the dolphins understand that you're helping them out.Sharp: Yeah, it's a really good question and I wish they did. I definitely can say in my over two decades of experience that most animals don't really appreciate the fact that you're trying to help them, unfortunately. When we do have our stranded dolphins, they oftentimes ... kind of lie on the foam mats that we provide for them. But I always tell people, never underestimate a stranded dolphin. They look completely helpless, but they can actually move fairly significantly. They can thrash their tail. They can do a full 360 barrel roll. So they can actually be quite dangerous. We also have safety protocols in place to make sure that people aren't stepping around what we call the danger zone, which is essentially anywhere from the dorsal fin back to the tail. That's an incredibly powerful area. They have impressive muscle structures there, so those animals can do a lot of damage, even though they look fairly harmless as they're lying on the foam mats for us. I wish they knew that we were helping, but we're able to get the job done for them.Rath: Well, makes it all the more intense from the sounds of it. Talk a bit about the release process. I imagine that also has to involve some precautions given the strength of these animals.Sharp: Absolutely. So when we release these animals, we obviously will do a whole briefing with our team before we enter the water so that everybody's aware of what the plan is. We all coordinate that effort significantly among the team. Then once we're in the water, we gauge it based on the conditions. Sometimes when we release, the conditions are beautiful. It's flat and calm out there. There's no waves and we can really take our time and reacclimate the dolphin to the ocean and get them pumping their tail, getting them a little bit more prepared to swim after being on land for a couple of hours. But sometimes we have to release animals into pretty terrible conditions out there just because we hadn't had a choice. So sometimes we can be dealing with waves that are kind of crushing on us and there are significant safety concerns. So that actually is giving us another opportunity through the Dolphin Rescue Center when those release conditions are really not safe for people or for dolphins, we'll be able to bring those animals back to the Dolphin Rescue Center, hold them for a little bit of time until the ocean calms down, and then we'll be able to release them in a much safer condition as well. So the Dolphin Rescue Center is basically going to be able to serve multiple purposes for us that we're thrilled about.Rath: Is there anything that can be done to to minimize dolphin strandings on the Cape, or because of the the geography and the fact that it's got fish that the dolphins want, is it just going to always be a hotspot?Sharp: Yeah, I think that's a great question and one I don't really have a great answer to, other than to say that dolphins have been stranding here for hundreds and hundreds of years. We have seen some changes in recent years, more or less a slow increase over the years in the number of animals that are stranding. We're not exactly sure why that's happening. Certainly there's a lot of changes going on out in the marine environment. The Gulf of Maine in particular is the fastest warming body of water on the planet. So we're certainly starting to see some changes in terms of maybe where the prey distribution is and the dolphins that strand follow the prey. We're seeing some changes in the species that we see strand and the timing of it in terms of when it happens in the year. Traditionally, we always said our busy season was from January to April as well, when we saw all of our dolphin mass strandings, but now it seems to be a bit more spread out year round. So things are definitely changing. It's a dynamic ecosystem, especially with global warming. It's something that we're paying a lot of attention to. I'm not really sure there's much we can do to decrease the number of dolphins that are actually stranding, so our role right now is to improve the survival of the ones that do.Rath: Sarah, it's been great talking with you about this. Really fascinating and wonderful work. Thank you.Sharp: Thanks so much for your interest.\", 'pubDate': 'Fri, 29 Sep 2023 18:03:00 GMT'}, {'title': \"Wu's plan for enforcement at Mass. and Cass faces council questions about existing police efforts\", 'link': 'https://www.wgbh.org/news/local/2023-09-29/wus-plan-for-enforcement-at-mass-and-cass-faces-council-questions-about-existing-police-efforts', 'description': \"City Councilors on opposing sides of the issue raised questions about the efficacy of Wu's plan for Mass. and Cass during a hearing Thursday.\", 'content:encoded': \"Mayor Michelle Wu’s proposed plan to crack down on homeless encampments at the area known as Mass. and Cass faced heated resistance Thursday during a marathon Boston City Council hearing — an eight-hour debate that centered around the efficacy of police enforcement in the troubled area. Wu filed the ordinance in late August, responding to increasing public safety concerns over the summer in the area at the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Melnea Cass Boulevard. The plan would bring in additional police officers to help disperse crowds and enforce a ban on tents and encampments. People living in tents would be given two weeks’ notice to clear makeshift shelters and place their belongings in storage.At the lengthy hearing, the proposal was criticized by normally opposing factions of the council — including conservative councilor Frank Baker and progressive councilors Ricardo Arroyo and Kendra Lara — who questioned if the ordinance would be necessary in an already heavily policed area with existing laws on the books.“There are ways to go in there and go through the population without removal and extreme displacement,” Baker said. “For us to say that we need an ordinance to clear these things is just wasting our time.”Arroyo said making the wrong decision could be fatal. “Unlike other things that we can afford to get wrong, if you get this wrong, more people die. More people are harmed,” he said. “That's a very different consequence. You don't get to unroll that.”Boston Police Commissioner Michael Cox defended the mayor's proposal, stating that removing tents and increasing police presence “will discourage bad actors” who are “looking to victimize the vulnerable while utilizing tents and other temporary structures to conceal their criminal activities.”Cox said that, without a warrant, police entering or searching through someone’s tent could pose a violation of a person's constitutional right against unreasonable searches and seizures. Without the privacy of a tent, he said, “it becomes a lot easier for us to pursue charges.” The ordinance also would help define the role of police officers at Mass. and Cass, Cox said, who have been “reluctant to engage” with people in the area.“Public-police relations during the protest period was, you know, not the best in the world,” Cox said, referencing a series of police brutality protests that began in 2020. “Maybe some officers didn't think that it was appropriate, and rightly so, to engage with people who are suffering from both mental illness and substance use disorders. They thought that maybe it's not our role, because the public was actually saying that.”But many others argued that current laws are enough to address the situation. The American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts submitted a statement to the council urging against giving police additional power.“There are already laws on the books in Massachusetts prohibiting drug trafficking, sexual assault, property crimes, and violence,” the ACLU wrote. “The Boston Police Department (BPD) already has the power to enforce those laws at Mass. and Cass to protect both people living on the street and those living and working in surrounding neighborhoods.”Councilor Lara asked Cox why police would need an ordinance to enforce laws at Mass. and Cass.“Nothing that you have said today has shown me that in order to increase public safety, you need this ordinance,” Lara said. “These are sworn, trained, armed officers. It is their job. And to hear that there is sex trafficking happening, but the police department has their hands tied behind their back and can’t do anything because there’s a tent? It’s unconscionable, especially with the amount of money that we're spending on policing in the city.”Wu filed the proposed ordinance in late August in response to increased public safety concerns, including reports of violence, drug and sex trafficking.Calls to police have increased by 10% as compared to this time last year, and arrests are up 21%, including 10 firearm-related arrests, Cox said. Violent crime is down, and despite a peak of 188 incidents reported to Boston Police in July, this year’s crime rate never reached levels seen during the same time last year, according to the city’s data dashboard.“Even though the data slightly shows a decrease in violent crime during the same period, we believe this is a result of significant under-reporting of crime in the area,” Cox said. “[It’s] not reflective of the true criminality that's actually occurring.”Dr. Bisola Ojikutu, the executive director of the Boston Public Health Commission, said the tents conceal illegal activity and public safety issues including deadly drug overdoses.Between 2019 and 2021, the rate of fatal overdoses in Boston rose by 36%, Ojikutu said. Last year, 352 people died from an overdose. “Those data are basically telling us that we have a huge problem,” she said.Newmarket Business Association president Sue Sullivan argued that tents make criminal activity less visible to police and conceal danger.“I have found people dead in these tents. I have talked to a woman who wasn't allowed out of a tent for three days because a guy was pimping her out in there, and that's just the tip of the iceberg,” Sullivan said. “Drug dealers are down there and they're in the tents, officers can't see them in there. They come and go and do their business, everybody knows it, but [police] can’t arrest them. We need those tents down.”In addition to an increased police presence, Wu’s proposed strategy includes dispatching four teams of outreach workers into neighboring areas and temporarily shutting down the Engagement Center, a city run site opened in 2017 for clinical and social services on nearby Atkinson Street.Wu’s plan would refer people from Mass. and Cass to shelters, if available, and provide transportation to the shelters if requested. A converted office space on Massachusetts Avenue would serve as a temporary overnight shelter for up to 30 people. The Boston Public Health Commission announced Thursday that it no longer plans to set up a clinic at that location.Tania Del Rio, the head of the city's Community Response Team, says outreach teams are working on a list of people and their individual needs — including whether they are amenable to shelter, if they’re seeking treatment or whether they have family members to return to.“This is going to be an ongoing conversation with them as people change their mind every day,” Del Rio said.Since 2019, mayoral administrations have conducted multiple large-scale sweeps of Mass. and Cass.Dr. Lara Jirmanus, the founder of the Massachusetts Coalition for Health Equity, told councilors at the hearing that research shows that police sweeps, tent clearings and dispersing crowds have been ineffective in the past.“I'm concerned that we’re kind of running into a vicious cycle of, you know, sweep, and then we have a couple of years, and then you're kind of back in this vicious cycle again,” Jirmanus said.If approved by a majority of the 13-member city council, the ordinance can go into effect immediately. On Thursday, the council did not vote on the measure. Arroyo, who chairs the council's government operations committee, told GBH News he's locking in a date for a working session ahead of the council's Oct. 30 deadline. If no action is taken by then, the ordinance will automatically go into effect.\", 'pubDate': 'Fri, 29 Sep 2023 16:02:07 GMT'}, {'title': \"The Academy is replacing Hattie McDaniel's Oscar that has been missing for 50 years\", 'link': 'https://www.wgbh.org/news/national/2023-09-29/the-academy-is-replacing-hattie-mcdaniels-oscar-that-has-been-missing-for-50-years', 'description': 'McDaniel, the first Black person to win an Academy Award, donated her Oscar to Howard University before her death.

Northumbria Police said the teen was arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage. He was in police custody and assisting officers with their inquiries, the force said. \"The tree is a world-renowned landmark and the vandalism has caused understandable shock and anger throughout the local community and beyond,\" police said in a statement. \"This is an incredibly sad day,\" police superintendent Kevin Waring said. \"The tree was iconic to the North East and enjoyed by so many who live in or who have visited this region.\" The Northumberland National Park authority asked the public not to visit the felled tree, which was voted English Tree of the Year in 2016.

Why did it cost so much more in Alaska?', 'link': 'https://www.wgbh.org/news/national/2023-09-29/she-received-chemo-in-two-states-why-did-it-cost-so-much-more-in-alaska', 'description': 'A breast cancer patient who received similar treatments in two states saw significant differences in cost, illuminating how care in remote areas can come with a stiffer price tag.', 'content:encoded': 'Emily Gebel was trying to figure out why she was having trouble breastfeeding. That\\'s when she felt a lump. Gebel, a mother of two children, went to her primary care doctor in Juneau, Alaska, who referred her for testing, she said. Her 9-month-old was asleep in her arms when she got the results. \"I got the call from my primary care nurse telling me it was cancer. And I remember I just sat there for probably at least another half an hour or so and cried,\" Gebel said. Juneau, the state capital, has about 31,700 residents, who are served by the city-owned Bartlett Regional Hospital. But Gebel said she has several friends who have also had cancer, all of whom recommended she seek treatment out of town because they felt bigger cities would have better care. She opted for treatment in Seattle, the closest major American city to Alaska. She underwent surgery at Virginia Mason Medical Center in September 2022. In January, she began chemotherapy at Lifespring Cancer Treatment Center, a stand-alone clinic that she said she selected because it offers a lower-dose chemotherapy. During chemo, she learned she had stage 4 breast cancer, she said. Commuting to Seattle for chemo every week — nonstop flights last as long as two hours and 45 minutes — became tiring. So Gebel began treatment at Bartlett Regional Hospital after her Seattle doctor taught hospital staffers there how to administer her chemo regimen. Then the bill came. The patient: Emily Gebel, 37, insured through her husband\\'s employer by Premera Blue Cross. She was previously covered by Moda Health. Medical service: One round of metronomic chemotherapy, which involves regular infusions at lower but more frequent doses and over a longer period than traditional chemotherapy. Service provider: Bartlett Regional Hospital and Lifespring Cancer Treatment Center. The hospital is a tax-exempt facility owned by the city and borough of Juneau, though most of its revenue comes from the services it provides, according to hospital officials. Lifespring is a stand-alone, doctor-owned cancer clinic in Seattle. Total bill: The prices for Emily\\'s chemo infusions at Bartlett Regional Hospital varied week to week. A hospital bill showed one infusion in July was listed at $5,077.28 — more than three times the price for a similar mix of drugs at the Seattle clinic, $1,611.24. What gives: In the United States, the price for the same medical service can vary based on where it is received. And for those living in remote areas like Alaska, the price difference can put care further out of reach. Emily\\'s firsthand experience with this disparity began after her husband, Jered, requested a cost estimate from Bartlett Regional Hospital. It said Emily\\'s chemo would cost around $7,500 per weekly infusion, more than 4½ times what she had been charged in Seattle. \"The email came through with the bill estimate, and it\\'s like, \\'Oh my goodness, this has to be wrong,\\'\" Jered said. Jered said Emily had met her annual out-of-pocket maximum, meaning her insurance would cover the costs of her treatment, but from the start, the disparity just bothered him. When Emily received a bill for a few rounds of her weekly chemo treatments, it showed that the hospital charged more than triple what the Seattle clinic did for a round of chemo, asking higher prices for every related service and medication she received that week. The hospital charged about $1,000 for the first hour of chemo infusion, which is more than twice the rate at the Seattle clinic. One of Emily\\'s drugs cost $714, more than three times the price at the clinic. It was even the tiniest things: The hospital charged $19.15 for Benadryl, about 22 times the clinic\\'s price of 87 cents. Staff at Lifespring Cancer Treatment Center, the Seattle clinic, did not reply to requests for comment. Sam Muse, the hospital\\'s former chief financial officer who no longer works there, said Bartlett Regional Hospital officials determined prices by looking at average wholesale prices and what other facilities in the region charge. Muse said the hospital had to account for high operating costs. \"Anything that we charge certainly has to take into consideration ... the cost of just supplying healthcare in a rural setting like Juneau,\" Muse said. \"We\\'re not accessible by road at all, only ferry or plane.\" Juneau\\'s isolated geography makes reaching many resources a challenge. The city is part of the Alaska Panhandle, a narrow, island-speckled sliver of the state wedged between Canada, the Pacific Ocean, and Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve. Neither Anchorage nor Vancouver, its nearest major cities, is close by. The hospital — the only one in the city and largest in the panhandle — treats a small number of cancer patients, at least a few hundred last year, Muse said. Its two oncologists live outside the city and fly into Juneau six times a month, said Erin Hardin, a hospital spokesperson. Bartlett spent nearly $11 million last year to pay and fly in nurses, doctors, and other staffers who live outside the city, Muse said. We\\'re \"trying to find that happy medium between keeping care here and keeping costs down and how do we do that in a sustainable way for the long term,\" Muse said. Even though research shows Alaskans seek emergency care and are admitted to the hospital less often than many Americans, they had the third-highest health care expenditures per capita in 2020. \"Alaska is special in that it\\'s small, it\\'s remote, therefore it\\'s more expensive,\" said Mouhcine Guettabi, an associate professor of economics at the University of North Carolina-Wilmington who studied health care costs in Alaska when he taught there. Guettabi said hospitals often need to offer higher wages to recruit doctors and nurses willing to live in Alaska, which has a higher cost of living than most states. Towns or entire regions may have few specialists and only one hospital, creating a dearth of competition that may drive up costs, Guettabi said. It\\'s also more expensive to ship items there, including medical supplies. But Alaska\\'s costs are higher even when taking all those factors into account, Guettabi said. In Anchorage, for instance, prices for medical items increased nearly three times faster from 1991 through 2017 than prices overall. Alaska also has a unique policy that may be increasing prices. Its \"80th percentile rule\" was enacted in 2004 to limit the amount of money patients pay when treated by providers outside their health insurers\\' network. But like many experiments meant to rein in costs, the rule has instead been increasing health care spending, according to a study by Guettabi. \"Critics think the rule may be adding to that soaring spending, partly because over time providers could increase their charges — and insurance payments would have to keep pace,\" the study noted. The resolution: Emily received a bill from the hospital in September, more than five months after beginning treatment there. It said Emily owed about $3,100 even though a previous explanation of benefits said she\\'d met her out-of-pocket limit. Jered said he contacted hospital billing officials, who discovered that a medicine had been incorrectly coded and told Jered that Emily\\'s charge was zero. \"We know how hard it is to pay these ridiculous medical bills,\" Jered said. \"If I\\'m able to push back a little bit against this massive system, well, hey, maybe other people can, too. And who knows, maybe eventually health care prices can come down.\" Emily said she\\'s glad Jered knows how to handle the financial aspects of her care. Like many Americans, she could have just paid or ignored the incorrect bills, risking being sent to collections. \"I can\\'t imagine the amount of time I would have to spend on it while juggling parenting and also dealing with completing treatment, going through the sickness that goes along with that, and just generally feeling very run down,\" she said. The takeaway: Alaska government officials, nonprofits, and experts have suggested methods to lower the cost of health care. The state is considering repealing the 80th percentile rule and implementing value-based care, which emphasizes paying providers based on health outcomes. But what should Alaskans and other patients do in the meantime? If you live in a high-cost state, you might check out prices at a health care system in a state next door. In any case, get ready to advocate for yourself. Jered learned about medical billing by following the Bill of the Month series and reading \"Never Pay the First Bill,\" a book by Marshall Allen, a former ProPublica reporter. Request itemized bills and make sure the codes match the services you received, Jered said. Note any prices that seem outrageous. If you have concerns, arrange an in-person meeting with an official in the provider\\'s finance department. If that\\'s not possible, a phone call is better than email. Make sure to document all conversations, so you have a record. Come prepared with your documents and evidence, including the rate paid by Medicare, the federal insurance system for those 65 and older. Ask the official to explain the reasons for the codes and pricing before contesting anything. You can sometimes negotiate high-priced services down. And remember that the person you\\'re speaking with isn\\'t to blame for your health care costs. \"Don\\'t come at them angry, don\\'t come at them as viewing them as the enemy — because they\\'re not,\" Jered said. \"They are working within the same broken system.\" Emmarie Huetteman of KFF Health News edited the digital story, and Taunya English of KFF Health News edited the audio story.

Some critical services will continue as employees work without pay.', 'content:encoded': 'Lawmakers are inching closer to a government shutdown when government funding runs out at the end of the day on Sept. 30. With a deal nowhere in sight, federal agencies are bracing to place hundreds of thousands of workers on unpaid furlough until funding is restored. The federal government hasn\\'t faced this dilemma since 2018 when the federal government shut down for 35 days, stretching into the new year in 2019. As in shutdowns past, people across the country will see a pause in federal services, programming and pay. Washington, D.C., residents and visitors could feel the impact quickly. Smithsonian facilities will remain open until money runs out. Then they will close, which could dampen the celebrations to say goodbye to the giant pandas in the National Zoo. Wildlife lovers outside of D.C. could see the National Park Service\\'s highly anticipated \"Fat Bear Week\" interrupted as well. Elsewhere, the impacts of a shutdown are likely to snowball as employees go without pay and programs run out of funding to operate. Still — many services will still be available. The Food and Drug Administration will continue \"All vital FDA activities related to imminent threats to the safety of human life,\" Social Security checks will still be issued, Veterans Affairs facilities will remain open. Air traffic and airport personnel will still be on the job, even if without pay, unless employees begin to call in sick to work as they did during the last shutdown. Another institution still running when the money runs out? Congress. They\\'ll keep working without pay, including many of the staffers that keep the Capitol running. Although most major federal agencies have not announced their plans for what would stay open and closed during a potential shut down, here\\'s what we see could be affected and what could continue. Federal employees could be furloughed or asked to work without pay The National Federation for Federal Employees, one of the unions that represents federal workers, estimates that 2.1 million civilian federal workers could see delayed paychecks and roughly 4 million federal contract workers could receive no paycheck. A representative for the Capital Area Food Bank in Washington told NPR the organization is making preparations for as many as 100,000 federal workers who could need food assistance if the government shuts down. Nutrition and food assistance programs could be paused The Agriculture Department, which runs the Supplemental Food Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Women Infants and Children (WIC) programs, is preparing for the nearly 7 million pregnant and postpartum women, infants, and children who rely on WIC to lose access during a shutdown. The USDA Food and Nutrition Service is likely to run out of funding to support normal WIC operations just a few days into a shutdown, according to USDA. The impact on WIC would likely be staggered because some states may have carryover funds or can use their own funds to continue program operations for different amounts of time. Still — Kate Franken, board chair for the National WIC Association, urges families to still seek benefits they think they might qualify for. \"I do think it gets to be really confusing for the public when they see information about a federal government shutdown and wonder what that means for various programs and services that they receive,\" Franken said. \"There\\'s a risk, and we\\'ve experienced this before during shutdowns, where families just sort of assumed that they can\\'t use their benefits or that they shouldn\\'t go to their appointment because services may be closed.\" Households that receive SNAP benefits, formerly known as food stamps, will receive October nutrition assistance as usual regardless of a potential shutdown. It is unknown how November benefits may be impacted should a shutdown persist. Social services for food and education come to a halt Head Start, which supports education for 3- and 4-year-olds across the country, and Meals on Wheels, which brings food to elderly people, could also get interrupted. National Parks are expected to close Visitor centers, campgrounds, research facilities, and museums could be closed for the duration of a shutdown. This would affect events and attractions scheduled for these sites Depending on how long the shutdown persists, this could create interruptions during the Indigenous People\\'s/Columbus Day three-day weekend for many. Last week, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., sent a letter to Interior Secretary Deb Haaland asking the department to use the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act to keep national parks and public lands open during a shut down. Funds from the law were used in 2018 to keep most parks open. Health care is likely to go uninterrupted, but research could pause People who get health care or health insurance from the federal government, whether that\\'s through Medicare or the Indian Health Service, should not experience any interruption in their care. They would still still go to the doctor and still make appointments. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services has enough money to keep paying states for Medicaid and CHIP, the children\\'s health insurance program, for at least for three months. That\\'s good news for around 90 million low-income people who rely on those health insurance programs However, community health centers that get their funding from federal grants could see their funding interrupted by a shutdown. Some clinics are warning they may need to cut back services or staff depending on the timing of the possible shutdown and how long it lasts. Other disruptions could occur at federal health agencies. A report from the Department of Health and Human Services says 42% of agency staff would be furloughed. The National Institutes of Health would furlough nearly 80% of its staff– the only work that would continue is caring for patients at NIH\\'s research hospital. Service members would also work without pay A shutdown would likely affect some 1.3 million active-duty servicemembers who would continue to work but would not get a paycheck. Of the estimated 800,000 Pentagon civilians, some 200,000 would be required to work without pay, because they are \"excepted\" and roles considered \"necessary to protect life and property.\" Another 439,000 of those would stay home without pay, the remainder are paid outside annual appropriations and wouldn\\'t be affected. The White House says all this would be disruptive to national security. The servicemembers are paid twice a month, and the next pay day is Friday, September 29th. Military Commissaries in the U.S. and abroad – which are basically neighborhood grocery stores – will stay open for approximately 60 days into the new fiscal year without appropriations, according to the Defense Department. After the funds run out, only overseas and remote locations will stay open, they warn. The shutdown would also affect those servicemembers scheduled to move to a new assignment. That travel would be halted during a shutdown. Federal law enforcement efforts could slow Larry Cosme, president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, said a lack of funding also means that there are no resources for federal agencies to continue participating in federal-state-local task forces. He said this includes those working on human trafficking investigations, to disrupt terrorist operations, and crack down on drug violations. Copyright 2023 NPR.

Dianne Feinstein of California, a centrist Democrat who was elected to the Senate in 1992 in the “Year of the Woman” and broke gender barriers throughout her long career in local and national politics, has died. She was 90.Three people familiar with the situation confirmed her death to The Associated Press on Friday.Feinstein, the oldest sitting U.S. senator, was a passionate advocate for liberal priorities important to her state -- including environmental protection, reproductive rights and gun control -- but was also known as a pragmatic lawmaker who reached out to Republicans and sought middle ground.She was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1969 and became its first female president in 1978, the same year Mayor George Moscone was gunned down alongside Supervisor Harvey Milk at City Hall by Dan White, a disgruntled former supervisor. Feinstein found Milk’s body.After Moscone’s death, Feinstein became San Francisco\\'s first female mayor. In the Senate, she was one of California’s first two female senators, the first woman to head the Senate Intelligence Committee and the first woman to serve as the Judiciary committee’s top Democrat.Although Feinstein was not always embraced by the feminist movement, her experiences colored her outlook through her five decades in politics.\"I recognize that women have had to fight for everything they have gotten, every right,\" she told The Associated Press in 2005, as the Judiciary Committee prepared to hold hearings on President George W. Bush\\'s nomination of John Roberts to replace Sandra Day O\\'Connor on the Supreme Court.\"So I must tell you, I try to look out for women\\'s rights. I also try to solve problems as I perceive them, with legislation, and reaching out where I can, and working across the aisle,\" she said.Her tendency for bipartisanship helped her notch legislative wins throughout her career. But it also proved to be a liability in her later years in Congress, as her state became more liberal and as the Senate and the electorate became increasingly polarized.A fierce debater who did not suffer fools, the California senator was long known for her verbal zingers and sharp comebacks when challenged on the issues about which she was most fervent. But she lost that edge in her later years in the Senate, as her health visibly declined and she often became confused when answering questions or speaking publicly. In February 2023, she said she would not run for a sixth term the next year. And within weeks of that announcement, she was absent for the Senate for more than two months as she recovered from a bout of shingles.Amid the concerns about her health, Feinstein stepped down as the top Democrat on the Judiciary panel after the 2020 elections, just as her party was about to take the majority. In 2023, she said she would not serve as the Senate president pro tempore, or the most senior member of the majority party, even though she was in line to do so. The president pro tempore opens the Senate every day and holds other ceremonial duties.One of Feinstein’s most significant legislative accomplishments was early in her career, when the Senate approved her amendment to ban manufacturing and sales of certain types of assault weapons as part of a crime bill that President Bill Clinton signed into law in 1994. Though the assault weapons ban expired 10 years later and was never renewed or replaced, it was a poignant win after her career had been significantly shaped by gun violence.Feinstein remembered finding Milk’s body, her finger slipping into a bullet hole as she felt for a pulse. It was a story she would retell often in the years ahead as she pushed for stricter gun control measures.She had little patience for Republicans and others who opposed her on that issue, though she was often challenged. In 1993, during debate on the assault weapons ban, Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, accused her of having an insufficient knowledge of guns and the gun control issue.Feinstein spoke fiercely of the violence she’d lived through in San Francisco and retorted: \\'\\'Senator, I know something about what firearms can do.”Two decades later, after 20 children and six educators were killed in a horrific school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, first-term Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas similarly challenged Feinstein during debate on legislation that would have permanently banned the weapons.\"I\\'m not a sixth grader,” Feinstein snapped back at the much younger Cruz -- a moment that later went viral. She added: \"It\\'s fine you want to lecture me on the Constitution. I appreciate it. Just know I\\'ve been here a long time.\"Feinstein became mayor of San Francisco after the 1978 slayings of Moscone and Milk, leading the city during one of the most turbulent periods in its history. Even her critics credited Feinstein with a calming influence, and she won reelection on her own to two four-year terms.With her success and growing recognition statewide came visibility on the national political stage.In 1984, Feinstein was viewed as a vice presidential possibility for Walter Mondale but faced questions about the business dealings of her husband, Richard Blum. In 1990, she used news footage of her announcement of the assassinations of Moscone and Milk in a television ad that helped her win the Democratic nomination for California governor, making her the first female major-party gubernatorial nominee in the state\\'s history.Although she narrowly lost the general election to Republican Pete Wilson, the stage was set for her election to the Senate two years later to fill the Senate seat Wilson had vacated to run for governor.Feinstein campaigned jointly with Barbara Boxer, who was running for the state\\'s other U.S. Senate seat, and both won, benefiting from positive news coverage and excitement over their historic race. California had never had a female U.S. senator, and female candidates and voters had been galvanized by the Supreme Court hearings in which the all-male Senate Judiciary Committee questioned Anita Hill about her sexual harassment allegations against nominee Clarence Thomas.Feinstein was appointed to the Judiciary panel and eventually the Senate Intelligence Committee, becoming the chairperson in 2009. She was the first woman to lead the intelligence panel, a high-profile perch that gave her a central oversight role over U.S. intelligence controversies, setbacks and triumphs, from the killing of Osama bin Laden to leaks about National Security Agency surveillance.Under Feinstein’s leadership, the intelligence committee conducted a wide-ranging, five-year investigation into CIA interrogation techniques during President George W. Bush’s administration, including waterboarding of terrorism suspects at secret overseas prisons. The resulting 6,300-page “torture report” concluded among other things that waterboarding and other \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" did not provide key evidence in the hunt for bin Laden. A 525-page executive summary was released in late 2014, but the rest of the report has remained classified.The Senate investigation was full of intrigue at the time, including documents that mysteriously disappeared and accusations traded between the Senate and the CIA that the other was stealing information. The drama was captured in a 2019 movie about the investigation called “The Report,” and actor Annette Bening was nominated for a Golden Globe for her portrayal of Feinstein.In the years since, Feinstein has continued to push aggressively for eventual declassification of the report.\"It\\'s my very strong belief that one day this report should be declassified,\" Feinstein said. \"This must be a lesson learned: that torture doesn\\'t work.\"Feinstein sometimes frustrated liberals by adopting moderate or hawkish positions that put her at odds with the left wing of the Democratic Party, as well as with the more liberal Boxer, who retired from the Senate in 2017. Feinstein defended the Obama administration’s expansive collection of Americans\\' phone and email records as necessary for protecting the country, for example, even as other Democratic senators voiced protests. “It’s called protecting America,” Feinstein said then.That tension escalated during Donald Trump’s presidency, when many Democrats had little appetite for compromise. Feinstein become the top Democrat on the Judiciary panel in 2016 and led her party’s messaging through three Supreme Court nominations -- a role that angered liberal advocacy groups that wanted to see a more aggressive partisan in charge.Feinstein closed out confirmation hearings for Justice Amy Coney Barrett with an embrace of Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and a public thanks to him for a job well done. “This has been one of the best set of hearings that I’ve participated in,” Feinstein said at the end of the hearing.Liberal advocacy groups that had fiercely opposed Barrett\\'s nomination to replace the late liberal icon Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg were furious and called for her to step down from the committee leadership.A month later, Feinstein announced she would remain on the committee but step down as the top Democrat. The senator, then 87 years old, did not say why. In a statement, she said she would “continue to do my utmost to bring about positive change in the coming years.”Feinstein was born on June 22, 1933. Her father, Leon Goldman, was a prominent surgeon and medical school professor in San Francisco, but her mother was an abusive woman with a violent temper that was often directed at Feinstein and her two younger sisters.Feinstein graduated from Stanford University in 1955, with a bachelor’s degree in history. She married young and was a divorced single mother of her daughter, Katherine, in 1960, at a time when such a status was still unusual.In 1961, Feinstein was appointed by then-Gov. Pat Brown to the women\\'s parole board, on which she served before running for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Typical of the era, much of the early coverage of her entrance into public life focused on her appearance, and she was invariably described as stunning, tall, slender and raven-haired.Feinstein\\'s second husband, Bert Feinstein, was 19 years older than she, but she described the marriage as \"a 10\" and kept his name even after his death from cancer in 1978. In 1980, she married investment banker Richard Blum, and thanks to his wealth, she was one of the richest members of the Senate. He died in February 2022.In addition to her daughter, Feinstein has a granddaughter, Eileen, and three stepchildren.', 'pubDate': 'Fri, 29 Sep 2023 13:13:10 GMT'}]\n",

He was 57. The Red Sox announced his death in a statement Sunday. Wakefield had brain cancer, according to ex-teammate Curt Schilling, who outed the illness on a podcast last week — drawing an outpouring of support for Wakefield. The Red Sox confirmed an illness at the time but did not elaborate, saying Wakefield had requested privacy. Drafted by the Pirates as a first baseman who set home run records in college, Wakefield converted to a pitcher after mastering the knuckleball in the minor leagues. Relying on the old-timey pitch that had largely fallen into disuse, he went on to win 200 major league games, including 186 with the Red Sox — behind only Cy Young and Roger Clemens in franchise history. But it was his role in the Red Sox-Yankees rivalry of the early 2000s that turned Wakefield into a fan favorite whose impact went far beyond his numbers. After New York rallied to tie Game 7 of the \\'03 AL Championship Series, Wakefield came on in relief in the 11th inning and Aaron Boone hit his first pitch for a walkoff home run to end Boston\\'s season and extend a World Series drought that stretched back to 1918. The following October, with the Red Sox season again at risk against the Yankees in the ALCS, Wakefield got nine outs in extra innings of Game 5, setting up David Ortiz to win it in the 14th. The Red Sox went on to complete their comeback from a three-games-to-none deficit and then sweep St. Louis in the World Series to claim their first championship in 86 years. \"He was a great competitor when he took that mound,\" former teammate Kevin Youkilis said on the broadcast of Sunday\\'s Red Sox game. \"He was just a great teammate and just a great friend. Had the luxury of playing with him on the field, in the booth, and just glad that I had the opportunity over the years to be alongside of him.\" The Red Sox, and Wakefield, won it all again in 2007. \"There were some years there where I didn\\'t know if I was going to come back or not,\" Wakefield said at his 2012 retirement news conference. \"But I\\'m very grateful that I\\'ve been able to put this uniform on for such a long time, and win two World Series for this great city.\" Wakefield was 11-3 when he made his only All-Star Game in 2009, becoming the second-oldest player — to Satchel Paige — ever selected to his first All-Star Game. Wakefield was the oldest player in baseball at 45 when he earned his 200th win in September 2011, retiring his final six batters. He announced his retirement the following spring training, seven wins short of breaking the franchise record for wins held by Clemens and Young. \"I\\'m still a competitor, but ultimately I think this is what\\'s best for the Red Sox,\" he said at the time. \"I think this is what\\'s best for my family. And to be honest with you, seven wins isn\\'t going to make me a different person or a better man. So, my family really needs me at home.\" An eighth-round Pittsburgh draft pick in 1988, Wakefield converted to a pitcher two years later in an effort to revive his chances of making the majors. He got his callup midway through the 1992 season and went 8-1, finishing third in the NL rookie of the year voting. He added two complete games in the NL playoffs — one in Game 6 to keep Pittsburgh alive. (He was voted the MVP of the Series late in Game 7, before the Atlanta Braves rallied to win on Francisco Cabrera\\'s single with two out in the bottom of the ninth.) But Wakefield was unable to recapture his success in his second year in Pittsburgh, going 6-11 with a 5.61 ERA. He was released by the Pirates after another trip through the minors, and signed six days later by the Red Sox. Wakefield again strung together a dominant run, starting 14-1 in 1995 before finishing the year at 16-8 with a 2.95 ERA. After 17 seasons with Boston, he retired as the franchise leader with 3,006 innings and 430 starts, and second in games and strikeouts. In all, he was 200-180 with a 4.41 ERA. Wakefield was also an eight-time nominee for the Roberto Clemente Award that goes to a ballplayer for exemplary sportsmanship and community involvement, winning it in 2010. \"Tim was more than just a versatile and reliable All-Star pitcher, a highly respected teammate, and a two-time World Series champion,\" baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement, citing \"the dedicated work he and his family did serving the communities of New England.\" After retiring, Wakefield became an analyst for Red Sox broadcasts and remained active in the team\\'s charities. \"Tim\\'s kindness and indomitable spirit were as legendary as his knuckleball,\" Red Sox owner John Henry said. \"He not only captivated us on the field but was the rare athlete whose legacy extended beyond the record books to the countless lives he touched with his warmth and genuine spirit. He had a remarkable ability to uplift, inspire, and connect with others in a way that showed us the true definition of greatness. He embodied the very best of what it means to be a member of the Boston Red Sox and his loss is felt deeply by all of us.\" Copyright 2023 NPR.

The Dolphin Rescue Center, located in Orleans and operated by the International Fund for Animal Welfare, plans to treat about twelve stranded dolphins and porpoises on the Cape each year. Before the facility opened up, rescue teams were operating in mobile clinics that could only hold the animals for a few hours, often not long enough to meet their needs. Now, dolphins will be able to receive care for up to four days, enough time to give many of them a fighting chance before being released back into the wild. GBH's All Things Considered host Arun Rath spoke with Sarah Sharp, a rescue animal veterinarian at the Dolphin Rescue Center about the work being done there. What follows is a lightly edited transcript.Rath: So as I mentioned, this is a first of its kind facility for dolphins. Tell us a bit more about why Cape Cod needs this kind of a clinic.Sharp: Absolutely. So Cape Cod, believe it or not, is actually a global hotspot for dolphin strandings. We see the highest frequency of dolphin mass strandings anywhere in the world. This little spit of land that sticks out into the Atlantic Ocean, we have a lot of dolphins that unfortunately get trapped there. So it gives us an incredible opportunity to actually be able to help these animals when they strand alive and to improve the medical care that they need and to put them back out into the wild as quickly as we can. But there are certainly a number of animals where their needs outmatch what we're able to provide in our mobile clinic right now, so this new dolphin rescue center gives us the opportunity to provide that added care that they need [along with] better diagnostics to be making sure that we're making the best decisions for these animals.Rath: So talk us through that process a little bit. What happens when you encounter a stranded animal up to the care point? What's different now about being able to have this long term care?Sharp: We are an organization that's always relied heavily on our volunteers, and so when we get a report of a stranded dolphin on Cape Cod, they're the first ones that we call to go out to the scene, find the animal and give us an update on the condition. When they confirm that it is a live dolphin, our rescue staff heads out in both our mobile clinic and our trucks to be able to access the animal. The animal is assessed in the field and we transport it using specialized stretchers into our mobile rescue clinic. We like to call it Moby for short. Once inside Moby, we can perform diagnostics on it. We can draw blood and run blood in-house there and do a full health assessment. We can do ultrasounds on these animals and find out from that information that we gain whether or not these animals are going to be good release candidates. If they are, then we take them to Provincetown and release them there, which gives us beach access to really deep water, very close to shore and access to good feeding habitats, basically where the whale watches go right off. So its great dolphin habitat, it gives those animals a good chance of survival. For the animals that are not quite healthy enough to be released immediately, those animals now will get a second chance, so they'll be able to come back with us. We'll transport them again in Moby to our dolphin rescue center in Orleans. There we will be able to admit them into one of our medical tanks and do better diagnostics on them, so we'll be able to get a better ultrasound in the pool there, and we'll be able to track their progress over a couple of days after receiving additional treatments to improve their condition. Then once they're ready and healthy enough to be released, we'll do essentially the same release process that we would have done with our other animals, release them back in Provincetown, back into the ocean.Rath: You know, these are obviously large and very strong animals, but the videos and photos that I've seen of the process, it doesn't seem like they're really resisting. Do you get a sense, and it's a strange question, that the dolphins understand that you're helping them out.Sharp: Yeah, it's a really good question and I wish they did. I definitely can say in my over two decades of experience that most animals don't really appreciate the fact that you're trying to help them, unfortunately. When we do have our stranded dolphins, they oftentimes ... kind of lie on the foam mats that we provide for them. But I always tell people, never underestimate a stranded dolphin. They look completely helpless, but they can actually move fairly significantly. They can thrash their tail. They can do a full 360 barrel roll. So they can actually be quite dangerous. We also have safety protocols in place to make sure that people aren't stepping around what we call the danger zone, which is essentially anywhere from the dorsal fin back to the tail. That's an incredibly powerful area. They have impressive muscle structures there, so those animals can do a lot of damage, even though they look fairly harmless as they're lying on the foam mats for us. I wish they knew that we were helping, but we're able to get the job done for them.Rath: Well, makes it all the more intense from the sounds of it. Talk a bit about the release process. I imagine that also has to involve some precautions given the strength of these animals.Sharp: Absolutely. So when we release these animals, we obviously will do a whole briefing with our team before we enter the water so that everybody's aware of what the plan is. We all coordinate that effort significantly among the team. Then once we're in the water, we gauge it based on the conditions. Sometimes when we release, the conditions are beautiful. It's flat and calm out there. There's no waves and we can really take our time and reacclimate the dolphin to the ocean and get them pumping their tail, getting them a little bit more prepared to swim after being on land for a couple of hours. But sometimes we have to release animals into pretty terrible conditions out there just because we hadn't had a choice. So sometimes we can be dealing with waves that are kind of crushing on us and there are significant safety concerns. So that actually is giving us another opportunity through the Dolphin Rescue Center when those release conditions are really not safe for people or for dolphins, we'll be able to bring those animals back to the Dolphin Rescue Center, hold them for a little bit of time until the ocean calms down, and then we'll be able to release them in a much safer condition as well. So the Dolphin Rescue Center is basically going to be able to serve multiple purposes for us that we're thrilled about.Rath: Is there anything that can be done to to minimize dolphin strandings on the Cape, or because of the the geography and the fact that it's got fish that the dolphins want, is it just going to always be a hotspot?Sharp: Yeah, I think that's a great question and one I don't really have a great answer to, other than to say that dolphins have been stranding here for hundreds and hundreds of years. We have seen some changes in recent years, more or less a slow increase over the years in the number of animals that are stranding. We're not exactly sure why that's happening. Certainly there's a lot of changes going on out in the marine environment. The Gulf of Maine in particular is the fastest warming body of water on the planet. So we're certainly starting to see some changes in terms of maybe where the prey distribution is and the dolphins that strand follow the prey. We're seeing some changes in the species that we see strand and the timing of it in terms of when it happens in the year. Traditionally, we always said our busy season was from January to April as well, when we saw all of our dolphin mass strandings, but now it seems to be a bit more spread out year round. So things are definitely changing. It's a dynamic ecosystem, especially with global warming. It's something that we're paying a lot of attention to. I'm not really sure there's much we can do to decrease the number of dolphins that are actually stranding, so our role right now is to improve the survival of the ones that do.Rath: Sarah, it's been great talking with you about this. Really fascinating and wonderful work. Thank you.Sharp: Thanks so much for your interest.\", 'pubDate': 'Fri, 29 Sep 2023 18:03:00 GMT'}, {'title': \"Wu's plan for enforcement at Mass. and Cass faces council questions about existing police efforts\", 'link': 'https://www.wgbh.org/news/local/2023-09-29/wus-plan-for-enforcement-at-mass-and-cass-faces-council-questions-about-existing-police-efforts', 'description': \"City Councilors on opposing sides of the issue raised questions about the efficacy of Wu's plan for Mass. and Cass during a hearing Thursday.\", 'content:encoded': \"Mayor Michelle Wu’s proposed plan to crack down on homeless encampments at the area known as Mass. and Cass faced heated resistance Thursday during a marathon Boston City Council hearing — an eight-hour debate that centered around the efficacy of police enforcement in the troubled area. Wu filed the ordinance in late August, responding to increasing public safety concerns over the summer in the area at the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Melnea Cass Boulevard. The plan would bring in additional police officers to help disperse crowds and enforce a ban on tents and encampments. People living in tents would be given two weeks’ notice to clear makeshift shelters and place their belongings in storage.At the lengthy hearing, the proposal was criticized by normally opposing factions of the council — including conservative councilor Frank Baker and progressive councilors Ricardo Arroyo and Kendra Lara — who questioned if the ordinance would be necessary in an already heavily policed area with existing laws on the books.“There are ways to go in there and go through the population without removal and extreme displacement,” Baker said. “For us to say that we need an ordinance to clear these things is just wasting our time.”Arroyo said making the wrong decision could be fatal. “Unlike other things that we can afford to get wrong, if you get this wrong, more people die. More people are harmed,” he said. “That's a very different consequence. You don't get to unroll that.”Boston Police Commissioner Michael Cox defended the mayor's proposal, stating that removing tents and increasing police presence “will discourage bad actors” who are “looking to victimize the vulnerable while utilizing tents and other temporary structures to conceal their criminal activities.”Cox said that, without a warrant, police entering or searching through someone’s tent could pose a violation of a person's constitutional right against unreasonable searches and seizures. Without the privacy of a tent, he said, “it becomes a lot easier for us to pursue charges.” The ordinance also would help define the role of police officers at Mass. and Cass, Cox said, who have been “reluctant to engage” with people in the area.“Public-police relations during the protest period was, you know, not the best in the world,” Cox said, referencing a series of police brutality protests that began in 2020. “Maybe some officers didn't think that it was appropriate, and rightly so, to engage with people who are suffering from both mental illness and substance use disorders. They thought that maybe it's not our role, because the public was actually saying that.”But many others argued that current laws are enough to address the situation. The American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts submitted a statement to the council urging against giving police additional power.“There are already laws on the books in Massachusetts prohibiting drug trafficking, sexual assault, property crimes, and violence,” the ACLU wrote. “The Boston Police Department (BPD) already has the power to enforce those laws at Mass. and Cass to protect both people living on the street and those living and working in surrounding neighborhoods.”Councilor Lara asked Cox why police would need an ordinance to enforce laws at Mass. and Cass.“Nothing that you have said today has shown me that in order to increase public safety, you need this ordinance,” Lara said. “These are sworn, trained, armed officers. It is their job. And to hear that there is sex trafficking happening, but the police department has their hands tied behind their back and can’t do anything because there’s a tent? It’s unconscionable, especially with the amount of money that we're spending on policing in the city.”Wu filed the proposed ordinance in late August in response to increased public safety concerns, including reports of violence, drug and sex trafficking.Calls to police have increased by 10% as compared to this time last year, and arrests are up 21%, including 10 firearm-related arrests, Cox said. Violent crime is down, and despite a peak of 188 incidents reported to Boston Police in July, this year’s crime rate never reached levels seen during the same time last year, according to the city’s data dashboard.“Even though the data slightly shows a decrease in violent crime during the same period, we believe this is a result of significant under-reporting of crime in the area,” Cox said. “[It’s] not reflective of the true criminality that's actually occurring.”Dr. Bisola Ojikutu, the executive director of the Boston Public Health Commission, said the tents conceal illegal activity and public safety issues including deadly drug overdoses.Between 2019 and 2021, the rate of fatal overdoses in Boston rose by 36%, Ojikutu said. Last year, 352 people died from an overdose. “Those data are basically telling us that we have a huge problem,” she said.Newmarket Business Association president Sue Sullivan argued that tents make criminal activity less visible to police and conceal danger.“I have found people dead in these tents. I have talked to a woman who wasn't allowed out of a tent for three days because a guy was pimping her out in there, and that's just the tip of the iceberg,” Sullivan said. “Drug dealers are down there and they're in the tents, officers can't see them in there. They come and go and do their business, everybody knows it, but [police] can’t arrest them. We need those tents down.”In addition to an increased police presence, Wu’s proposed strategy includes dispatching four teams of outreach workers into neighboring areas and temporarily shutting down the Engagement Center, a city run site opened in 2017 for clinical and social services on nearby Atkinson Street.Wu’s plan would refer people from Mass. and Cass to shelters, if available, and provide transportation to the shelters if requested. A converted office space on Massachusetts Avenue would serve as a temporary overnight shelter for up to 30 people. The Boston Public Health Commission announced Thursday that it no longer plans to set up a clinic at that location.Tania Del Rio, the head of the city's Community Response Team, says outreach teams are working on a list of people and their individual needs — including whether they are amenable to shelter, if they’re seeking treatment or whether they have family members to return to.“This is going to be an ongoing conversation with them as people change their mind every day,” Del Rio said.Since 2019, mayoral administrations have conducted multiple large-scale sweeps of Mass. and Cass.Dr. Lara Jirmanus, the founder of the Massachusetts Coalition for Health Equity, told councilors at the hearing that research shows that police sweeps, tent clearings and dispersing crowds have been ineffective in the past.“I'm concerned that we’re kind of running into a vicious cycle of, you know, sweep, and then we have a couple of years, and then you're kind of back in this vicious cycle again,” Jirmanus said.If approved by a majority of the 13-member city council, the ordinance can go into effect immediately. On Thursday, the council did not vote on the measure. Arroyo, who chairs the council's government operations committee, told GBH News he's locking in a date for a working session ahead of the council's Oct. 30 deadline. If no action is taken by then, the ordinance will automatically go into effect.\", 'pubDate': 'Fri, 29 Sep 2023 16:02:07 GMT'}, {'title': \"The Academy is replacing Hattie McDaniel's Oscar that has been missing for 50 years\", 'link': 'https://www.wgbh.org/news/national/2023-09-29/the-academy-is-replacing-hattie-mcdaniels-oscar-that-has-been-missing-for-50-years', 'description': 'McDaniel, the first Black person to win an Academy Award, donated her Oscar to Howard University before her death.

That\\'s when she felt a lump. Gebel, a mother of two children, went to her primary care doctor in Juneau, Alaska, who referred her for testing, she said. Her 9-month-old was asleep in her arms when she got the results. \"I got the call from my primary care nurse telling me it was cancer. And I remember I just sat there for probably at least another half an hour or so and cried,\" Gebel said. Juneau, the state capital, has about 31,700 residents, who are served by the city-owned Bartlett Regional Hospital. But Gebel said she has several friends who have also had cancer, all of whom recommended she seek treatment out of town because they felt bigger cities would have better care. She opted for treatment in Seattle, the closest major American city to Alaska. She underwent surgery at Virginia Mason Medical Center in September 2022. In January, she began chemotherapy at Lifespring Cancer Treatment Center, a stand-alone clinic that she said she selected because it offers a lower-dose chemotherapy. During chemo, she learned she had stage 4 breast cancer, she said. Commuting to Seattle for chemo every week — nonstop flights last as long as two hours and 45 minutes — became tiring. So Gebel began treatment at Bartlett Regional Hospital after her Seattle doctor taught hospital staffers there how to administer her chemo regimen. Then the bill came. The patient: Emily Gebel, 37, insured through her husband\\'s employer by Premera Blue Cross. She was previously covered by Moda Health. Medical service: One round of metronomic chemotherapy, which involves regular infusions at lower but more frequent doses and over a longer period than traditional chemotherapy. Service provider: Bartlett Regional Hospital and Lifespring Cancer Treatment Center. The hospital is a tax-exempt facility owned by the city and borough of Juneau, though most of its revenue comes from the services it provides, according to hospital officials. Lifespring is a stand-alone, doctor-owned cancer clinic in Seattle. Total bill: The prices for Emily\\'s chemo infusions at Bartlett Regional Hospital varied week to week. A hospital bill showed one infusion in July was listed at $5,077.28 — more than three times the price for a similar mix of drugs at the Seattle clinic, $1,611.24. What gives: In the United States, the price for the same medical service can vary based on where it is received. And for those living in remote areas like Alaska, the price difference can put care further out of reach. Emily\\'s firsthand experience with this disparity began after her husband, Jered, requested a cost estimate from Bartlett Regional Hospital. It said Emily\\'s chemo would cost around $7,500 per weekly infusion, more than 4½ times what she had been charged in Seattle. \"The email came through with the bill estimate, and it\\'s like, \\'Oh my goodness, this has to be wrong,\\'\" Jered said. Jered said Emily had met her annual out-of-pocket maximum, meaning her insurance would cover the costs of her treatment, but from the start, the disparity just bothered him. When Emily received a bill for a few rounds of her weekly chemo treatments, it showed that the hospital charged more than triple what the Seattle clinic did for a round of chemo, asking higher prices for every related service and medication she received that week. The hospital charged about $1,000 for the first hour of chemo infusion, which is more than twice the rate at the Seattle clinic. One of Emily\\'s drugs cost $714, more than three times the price at the clinic. It was even the tiniest things: The hospital charged $19.15 for Benadryl, about 22 times the clinic\\'s price of 87 cents. Staff at Lifespring Cancer Treatment Center, the Seattle clinic, did not reply to requests for comment. Sam Muse, the hospital\\'s former chief financial officer who no longer works there, said Bartlett Regional Hospital officials determined prices by looking at average wholesale prices and what other facilities in the region charge. Muse said the hospital had to account for high operating costs. \"Anything that we charge certainly has to take into consideration ... the cost of just supplying healthcare in a rural setting like Juneau,\" Muse said. \"We\\'re not accessible by road at all, only ferry or plane.\" Juneau\\'s isolated geography makes reaching many resources a challenge. The city is part of the Alaska Panhandle, a narrow, island-speckled sliver of the state wedged between Canada, the Pacific Ocean, and Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve. Neither Anchorage nor Vancouver, its nearest major cities, is close by. The hospital — the only one in the city and largest in the panhandle — treats a small number of cancer patients, at least a few hundred last year, Muse said. Its two oncologists live outside the city and fly into Juneau six times a month, said Erin Hardin, a hospital spokesperson. Bartlett spent nearly $11 million last year to pay and fly in nurses, doctors, and other staffers who live outside the city, Muse said. We\\'re \"trying to find that happy medium between keeping care here and keeping costs down and how do we do that in a sustainable way for the long term,\" Muse said. Even though research shows Alaskans seek emergency care and are admitted to the hospital less often than many Americans, they had the third-highest health care expenditures per capita in 2020. \"Alaska is special in that it\\'s small, it\\'s remote, therefore it\\'s more expensive,\" said Mouhcine Guettabi, an associate professor of economics at the University of North Carolina-Wilmington who studied health care costs in Alaska when he taught there. Guettabi said hospitals often need to offer higher wages to recruit doctors and nurses willing to live in Alaska, which has a higher cost of living than most states. Towns or entire regions may have few specialists and only one hospital, creating a dearth of competition that may drive up costs, Guettabi said. It\\'s also more expensive to ship items there, including medical supplies. But Alaska\\'s costs are higher even when taking all those factors into account, Guettabi said. In Anchorage, for instance, prices for medical items increased nearly three times faster from 1991 through 2017 than prices overall. Alaska also has a unique policy that may be increasing prices. Its \"80th percentile rule\" was enacted in 2004 to limit the amount of money patients pay when treated by providers outside their health insurers\\' network. But like many experiments meant to rein in costs, the rule has instead been increasing health care spending, according to a study by Guettabi. \"Critics think the rule may be adding to that soaring spending, partly because over time providers could increase their charges — and insurance payments would have to keep pace,\" the study noted. The resolution: Emily received a bill from the hospital in September, more than five months after beginning treatment there. It said Emily owed about $3,100 even though a previous explanation of benefits said she\\'d met her out-of-pocket limit. Jered said he contacted hospital billing officials, who discovered that a medicine had been incorrectly coded and told Jered that Emily\\'s charge was zero. \"We know how hard it is to pay these ridiculous medical bills,\" Jered said. \"If I\\'m able to push back a little bit against this massive system, well, hey, maybe other people can, too. And who knows, maybe eventually health care prices can come down.\" Emily said she\\'s glad Jered knows how to handle the financial aspects of her care. Like many Americans, she could have just paid or ignored the incorrect bills, risking being sent to collections. \"I can\\'t imagine the amount of time I would have to spend on it while juggling parenting and also dealing with completing treatment, going through the sickness that goes along with that, and just generally feeling very run down,\" she said. The takeaway: Alaska government officials, nonprofits, and experts have suggested methods to lower the cost of health care. The state is considering repealing the 80th percentile rule and implementing value-based care, which emphasizes paying providers based on health outcomes. But what should Alaskans and other patients do in the meantime? If you live in a high-cost state, you might check out prices at a health care system in a state next door. In any case, get ready to advocate for yourself. Jered learned about medical billing by following the Bill of the Month series and reading \"Never Pay the First Bill,\" a book by Marshall Allen, a former ProPublica reporter. Request itemized bills and make sure the codes match the services you received, Jered said. Note any prices that seem outrageous. If you have concerns, arrange an in-person meeting with an official in the provider\\'s finance department. If that\\'s not possible, a phone call is better than email. Make sure to document all conversations, so you have a record. Come prepared with your documents and evidence, including the rate paid by Medicare, the federal insurance system for those 65 and older. Ask the official to explain the reasons for the codes and pricing before contesting anything. You can sometimes negotiate high-priced services down. And remember that the person you\\'re speaking with isn\\'t to blame for your health care costs. \"Don\\'t come at them angry, don\\'t come at them as viewing them as the enemy — because they\\'re not,\" Jered said. \"They are working within the same broken system.\" Emmarie Huetteman of KFF Health News edited the digital story, and Taunya English of KFF Health News edited the audio story.

Some critical services will continue as employees work without pay.', 'content:encoded': 'Lawmakers are inching closer to a government shutdown when government funding runs out at the end of the day on Sept. 30. With a deal nowhere in sight, federal agencies are bracing to place hundreds of thousands of workers on unpaid furlough until funding is restored. The federal government hasn\\'t faced this dilemma since 2018 when the federal government shut down for 35 days, stretching into the new year in 2019. As in shutdowns past, people across the country will see a pause in federal services, programming and pay. Washington, D.C., residents and visitors could feel the impact quickly. Smithsonian facilities will remain open until money runs out. Then they will close, which could dampen the celebrations to say goodbye to the giant pandas in the National Zoo. Wildlife lovers outside of D.C. could see the National Park Service\\'s highly anticipated \"Fat Bear Week\" interrupted as well. Elsewhere, the impacts of a shutdown are likely to snowball as employees go without pay and programs run out of funding to operate. Still — many services will still be available. The Food and Drug Administration will continue \"All vital FDA activities related to imminent threats to the safety of human life,\" Social Security checks will still be issued, Veterans Affairs facilities will remain open. Air traffic and airport personnel will still be on the job, even if without pay, unless employees begin to call in sick to work as they did during the last shutdown. Another institution still running when the money runs out? Congress. They\\'ll keep working without pay, including many of the staffers that keep the Capitol running. Although most major federal agencies have not announced their plans for what would stay open and closed during a potential shut down, here\\'s what we see could be affected and what could continue. Federal employees could be furloughed or asked to work without pay The National Federation for Federal Employees, one of the unions that represents federal workers, estimates that 2.1 million civilian federal workers could see delayed paychecks and roughly 4 million federal contract workers could receive no paycheck. A representative for the Capital Area Food Bank in Washington told NPR the organization is making preparations for as many as 100,000 federal workers who could need food assistance if the government shuts down. Nutrition and food assistance programs could be paused The Agriculture Department, which runs the Supplemental Food Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Women Infants and Children (WIC) programs, is preparing for the nearly 7 million pregnant and postpartum women, infants, and children who rely on WIC to lose access during a shutdown. The USDA Food and Nutrition Service is likely to run out of funding to support normal WIC operations just a few days into a shutdown, according to USDA. The impact on WIC would likely be staggered because some states may have carryover funds or can use their own funds to continue program operations for different amounts of time. Still — Kate Franken, board chair for the National WIC Association, urges families to still seek benefits they think they might qualify for. \"I do think it gets to be really confusing for the public when they see information about a federal government shutdown and wonder what that means for various programs and services that they receive,\" Franken said. \"There\\'s a risk, and we\\'ve experienced this before during shutdowns, where families just sort of assumed that they can\\'t use their benefits or that they shouldn\\'t go to their appointment because services may be closed.\" Households that receive SNAP benefits, formerly known as food stamps, will receive October nutrition assistance as usual regardless of a potential shutdown. It is unknown how November benefits may be impacted should a shutdown persist. Social services for food and education come to a halt Head Start, which supports education for 3- and 4-year-olds across the country, and Meals on Wheels, which brings food to elderly people, could also get interrupted. National Parks are expected to close Visitor centers, campgrounds, research facilities, and museums could be closed for the duration of a shutdown. This would affect events and attractions scheduled for these sites Depending on how long the shutdown persists, this could create interruptions during the Indigenous People\\'s/Columbus Day three-day weekend for many. Last week, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., sent a letter to Interior Secretary Deb Haaland asking the department to use the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act to keep national parks and public lands open during a shut down. Funds from the law were used in 2018 to keep most parks open. Health care is likely to go uninterrupted, but research could pause People who get health care or health insurance from the federal government, whether that\\'s through Medicare or the Indian Health Service, should not experience any interruption in their care. They would still still go to the doctor and still make appointments. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services has enough money to keep paying states for Medicaid and CHIP, the children\\'s health insurance program, for at least for three months. That\\'s good news for around 90 million low-income people who rely on those health insurance programs However, community health centers that get their funding from federal grants could see their funding interrupted by a shutdown. Some clinics are warning they may need to cut back services or staff depending on the timing of the possible shutdown and how long it lasts. Other disruptions could occur at federal health agencies. A report from the Department of Health and Human Services says 42% of agency staff would be furloughed. The National Institutes of Health would furlough nearly 80% of its staff– the only work that would continue is caring for patients at NIH\\'s research hospital. Service members would also work without pay A shutdown would likely affect some 1.3 million active-duty servicemembers who would continue to work but would not get a paycheck. Of the estimated 800,000 Pentagon civilians, some 200,000 would be required to work without pay, because they are \"excepted\" and roles considered \"necessary to protect life and property.\" Another 439,000 of those would stay home without pay, the remainder are paid outside annual appropriations and wouldn\\'t be affected. The White House says all this would be disruptive to national security. The servicemembers are paid twice a month, and the next pay day is Friday, September 29th. Military Commissaries in the U.S. and abroad – which are basically neighborhood grocery stores – will stay open for approximately 60 days into the new fiscal year without appropriations, according to the Defense Department. After the funds run out, only overseas and remote locations will stay open, they warn. The shutdown would also affect those servicemembers scheduled to move to a new assignment. That travel would be halted during a shutdown. Federal law enforcement efforts could slow Larry Cosme, president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, said a lack of funding also means that there are no resources for federal agencies to continue participating in federal-state-local task forces. He said this includes those working on human trafficking investigations, to disrupt terrorist operations, and crack down on drug violations. Copyright 2023 NPR.

Dianne Feinstein of California dies at age 90, sources tell the AP', 'link': 'https://www.wgbh.org/news/national/2023-09-29/democratic-sen-dianne-feinstein-of-california-dies-at-age-90-sources-tell-the-ap', 'description': 'Feinstein, the oldest sitting U.S. senator, said earlier this year she would not run for a sixth term in 2024.', 'content:encoded': 'WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, a centrist Democrat who was elected to the Senate in 1992 in the “Year of the Woman” and broke gender barriers throughout her long career in local and national politics, has died. She was 90.Three people familiar with the situation confirmed her death to The Associated Press on Friday.Feinstein, the oldest sitting U.S. senator, was a passionate advocate for liberal priorities important to her state -- including environmental protection, reproductive rights and gun control -- but was also known as a pragmatic lawmaker who reached out to Republicans and sought middle ground.She was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1969 and became its first female president in 1978, the same year Mayor George Moscone was gunned down alongside Supervisor Harvey Milk at City Hall by Dan White, a disgruntled former supervisor. Feinstein found Milk’s body.After Moscone’s death, Feinstein became San Francisco\\'s first female mayor. In the Senate, she was one of California’s first two female senators, the first woman to head the Senate Intelligence Committee and the first woman to serve as the Judiciary committee’s top Democrat.Although Feinstein was not always embraced by the feminist movement, her experiences colored her outlook through her five decades in politics.\"I recognize that women have had to fight for everything they have gotten, every right,\" she told The Associated Press in 2005, as the Judiciary Committee prepared to hold hearings on President George W. Bush\\'s nomination of John Roberts to replace Sandra Day O\\'Connor on the Supreme Court.\"So I must tell you, I try to look out for women\\'s rights. I also try to solve problems as I perceive them, with legislation, and reaching out where I can, and working across the aisle,\" she said.Her tendency for bipartisanship helped her notch legislative wins throughout her career. But it also proved to be a liability in her later years in Congress, as her state became more liberal and as the Senate and the electorate became increasingly polarized.A fierce debater who did not suffer fools, the California senator was long known for her verbal zingers and sharp comebacks when challenged on the issues about which she was most fervent. But she lost that edge in her later years in the Senate, as her health visibly declined and she often became confused when answering questions or speaking publicly. In February 2023, she said she would not run for a sixth term the next year. And within weeks of that announcement, she was absent for the Senate for more than two months as she recovered from a bout of shingles.Amid the concerns about her health, Feinstein stepped down as the top Democrat on the Judiciary panel after the 2020 elections, just as her party was about to take the majority. In 2023, she said she would not serve as the Senate president pro tempore, or the most senior member of the majority party, even though she was in line to do so. The president pro tempore opens the Senate every day and holds other ceremonial duties.One of Feinstein’s most significant legislative accomplishments was early in her career, when the Senate approved her amendment to ban manufacturing and sales of certain types of assault weapons as part of a crime bill that President Bill Clinton signed into law in 1994. Though the assault weapons ban expired 10 years later and was never renewed or replaced, it was a poignant win after her career had been significantly shaped by gun violence.Feinstein remembered finding Milk’s body, her finger slipping into a bullet hole as she felt for a pulse. It was a story she would retell often in the years ahead as she pushed for stricter gun control measures.She had little patience for Republicans and others who opposed her on that issue, though she was often challenged. In 1993, during debate on the assault weapons ban, Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, accused her of having an insufficient knowledge of guns and the gun control issue.Feinstein spoke fiercely of the violence she’d lived through in San Francisco and retorted: \\'\\'Senator, I know something about what firearms can do.”Two decades later, after 20 children and six educators were killed in a horrific school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, first-term Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas similarly challenged Feinstein during debate on legislation that would have permanently banned the weapons.\"I\\'m not a sixth grader,” Feinstein snapped back at the much younger Cruz -- a moment that later went viral. She added: \"It\\'s fine you want to lecture me on the Constitution. I appreciate it. Just know I\\'ve been here a long time.\"Feinstein became mayor of San Francisco after the 1978 slayings of Moscone and Milk, leading the city during one of the most turbulent periods in its history. Even her critics credited Feinstein with a calming influence, and she won reelection on her own to two four-year terms.With her success and growing recognition statewide came visibility on the national political stage.In 1984, Feinstein was viewed as a vice presidential possibility for Walter Mondale but faced questions about the business dealings of her husband, Richard Blum. In 1990, she used news footage of her announcement of the assassinations of Moscone and Milk in a television ad that helped her win the Democratic nomination for California governor, making her the first female major-party gubernatorial nominee in the state\\'s history.Although she narrowly lost the general election to Republican Pete Wilson, the stage was set for her election to the Senate two years later to fill the Senate seat Wilson had vacated to run for governor.Feinstein campaigned jointly with Barbara Boxer, who was running for the state\\'s other U.S. Senate seat, and both won, benefiting from positive news coverage and excitement over their historic race. California had never had a female U.S. senator, and female candidates and voters had been galvanized by the Supreme Court hearings in which the all-male Senate Judiciary Committee questioned Anita Hill about her sexual harassment allegations against nominee Clarence Thomas.Feinstein was appointed to the Judiciary panel and eventually the Senate Intelligence Committee, becoming the chairperson in 2009. She was the first woman to lead the intelligence panel, a high-profile perch that gave her a central oversight role over U.S. intelligence controversies, setbacks and triumphs, from the killing of Osama bin Laden to leaks about National Security Agency surveillance.Under Feinstein’s leadership, the intelligence committee conducted a wide-ranging, five-year investigation into CIA interrogation techniques during President George W. Bush’s administration, including waterboarding of terrorism suspects at secret overseas prisons. The resulting 6,300-page “torture report” concluded among other things that waterboarding and other \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" did not provide key evidence in the hunt for bin Laden. A 525-page executive summary was released in late 2014, but the rest of the report has remained classified.The Senate investigation was full of intrigue at the time, including documents that mysteriously disappeared and accusations traded between the Senate and the CIA that the other was stealing information. The drama was captured in a 2019 movie about the investigation called “The Report,” and actor Annette Bening was nominated for a Golden Globe for her portrayal of Feinstein.In the years since, Feinstein has continued to push aggressively for eventual declassification of the report.\"It\\'s my very strong belief that one day this report should be declassified,\" Feinstein said. \"This must be a lesson learned: that torture doesn\\'t work.\"Feinstein sometimes frustrated liberals by adopting moderate or hawkish positions that put her at odds with the left wing of the Democratic Party, as well as with the more liberal Boxer, who retired from the Senate in 2017. Feinstein defended the Obama administration’s expansive collection of Americans\\' phone and email records as necessary for protecting the country, for example, even as other Democratic senators voiced protests. “It’s called protecting America,” Feinstein said then.That tension escalated during Donald Trump’s presidency, when many Democrats had little appetite for compromise. Feinstein become the top Democrat on the Judiciary panel in 2016 and led her party’s messaging through three Supreme Court nominations -- a role that angered liberal advocacy groups that wanted to see a more aggressive partisan in charge.Feinstein closed out confirmation hearings for Justice Amy Coney Barrett with an embrace of Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and a public thanks to him for a job well done. “This has been one of the best set of hearings that I’ve participated in,” Feinstein said at the end of the hearing.Liberal advocacy groups that had fiercely opposed Barrett\\'s nomination to replace the late liberal icon Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg were furious and called for her to step down from the committee leadership.A month later, Feinstein announced she would remain on the committee but step down as the top Democrat. The senator, then 87 years old, did not say why. In a statement, she said she would “continue to do my utmost to bring about positive change in the coming years.”Feinstein was born on June 22, 1933. Her father, Leon Goldman, was a prominent surgeon and medical school professor in San Francisco, but her mother was an abusive woman with a violent temper that was often directed at Feinstein and her two younger sisters.Feinstein graduated from Stanford University in 1955, with a bachelor’s degree in history. She married young and was a divorced single mother of her daughter, Katherine, in 1960, at a time when such a status was still unusual.In 1961, Feinstein was appointed by then-Gov. Pat Brown to the women\\'s parole board, on which she served before running for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Typical of the era, much of the early coverage of her entrance into public life focused on her appearance, and she was invariably described as stunning, tall, slender and raven-haired.Feinstein\\'s second husband, Bert Feinstein, was 19 years older than she, but she described the marriage as \"a 10\" and kept his name even after his death from cancer in 1978. In 1980, she married investment banker Richard Blum, and thanks to his wealth, she was one of the richest members of the Senate. He died in February 2022.In addition to her daughter, Feinstein has a granddaughter, Eileen, and three stepchildren.', 'pubDate': 'Fri, 29 Sep 2023 13:13:10 GMT'}]\n",

He was 57. The Red Sox announced his death in a statement Sunday. Wakefield had brain cancer, according to ex-teammate Curt Schilling, who outed the illness on a podcast last week — drawing an outpouring of support for Wakefield. The Red Sox confirmed an illness at the time but did not elaborate, saying Wakefield had requested privacy. Drafted by the Pirates as a first baseman who set home run records in college, Wakefield converted to a pitcher after mastering the knuckleball in the minor leagues. Relying on the old-timey pitch that had largely fallen into disuse, he went on to win 200 major league games, including 186 with the Red Sox — behind only Cy Young and Roger Clemens in franchise history. But it was his role in the Red Sox-Yankees rivalry of the early 2000s that turned Wakefield into a fan favorite whose impact went far beyond his numbers. After New York rallied to tie Game 7 of the \\'03 AL Championship Series, Wakefield came on in relief in the 11th inning and Aaron Boone hit his first pitch for a walkoff home run to end Boston\\'s season and extend a World Series drought that stretched back to 1918. The following October, with the Red Sox season again at risk against the Yankees in the ALCS, Wakefield got nine outs in extra innings of Game 5, setting up David Ortiz to win it in the 14th. The Red Sox went on to complete their comeback from a three-games-to-none deficit and then sweep St. Louis in the World Series to claim their first championship in 86 years. \"He was a great competitor when he took that mound,\" former teammate Kevin Youkilis said on the broadcast of Sunday\\'s Red Sox game. \"He was just a great teammate and just a great friend. Had the luxury of playing with him on the field, in the booth, and just glad that I had the opportunity over the years to be alongside of him.\" The Red Sox, and Wakefield, won it all again in 2007. \"There were some years there where I didn\\'t know if I was going to come back or not,\" Wakefield said at his 2012 retirement news conference. \"But I\\'m very grateful that I\\'ve been able to put this uniform on for such a long time, and win two World Series for this great city.\" Wakefield was 11-3 when he made his only All-Star Game in 2009, becoming the second-oldest player — to Satchel Paige — ever selected to his first All-Star Game. Wakefield was the oldest player in baseball at 45 when he earned his 200th win in September 2011, retiring his final six batters. He announced his retirement the following spring training, seven wins short of breaking the franchise record for wins held by Clemens and Young. \"I\\'m still a competitor, but ultimately I think this is what\\'s best for the Red Sox,\" he said at the time. \"I think this is what\\'s best for my family. And to be honest with you, seven wins isn\\'t going to make me a different person or a better man. So, my family really needs me at home.\" An eighth-round Pittsburgh draft pick in 1988, Wakefield converted to a pitcher two years later in an effort to revive his chances of making the majors. He got his callup midway through the 1992 season and went 8-1, finishing third in the NL rookie of the year voting. He added two complete games in the NL playoffs — one in Game 6 to keep Pittsburgh alive. (He was voted the MVP of the Series late in Game 7, before the Atlanta Braves rallied to win on Francisco Cabrera\\'s single with two out in the bottom of the ninth.) But Wakefield was unable to recapture his success in his second year in Pittsburgh, going 6-11 with a 5.61 ERA. He was released by the Pirates after another trip through the minors, and signed six days later by the Red Sox. Wakefield again strung together a dominant run, starting 14-1 in 1995 before finishing the year at 16-8 with a 2.95 ERA. After 17 seasons with Boston, he retired as the franchise leader with 3,006 innings and 430 starts, and second in games and strikeouts. In all, he was 200-180 with a 4.41 ERA. Wakefield was also an eight-time nominee for the Roberto Clemente Award that goes to a ballplayer for exemplary sportsmanship and community involvement, winning it in 2010. \"Tim was more than just a versatile and reliable All-Star pitcher, a highly respected teammate, and a two-time World Series champion,\" baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement, citing \"the dedicated work he and his family did serving the communities of New England.\" After retiring, Wakefield became an analyst for Red Sox broadcasts and remained active in the team\\'s charities. \"Tim\\'s kindness and indomitable spirit were as legendary as his knuckleball,\" Red Sox owner John Henry said. \"He not only captivated us on the field but was the rare athlete whose legacy extended beyond the record books to the countless lives he touched with his warmth and genuine spirit. He had a remarkable ability to uplift, inspire, and connect with others in a way that showed us the true definition of greatness. He embodied the very best of what it means to be a member of the Boston Red Sox and his loss is felt deeply by all of us.\" Copyright 2023 NPR.

It is what Harvard was made to do.”Gay also faces a couple of unprecedented challenges as the school’s newest president.Earlier this year, the Supreme Court struck down Harvard University’s race-conscious admissions policy, ending the use of affirmative action.Gay has already been on the job for months, and said in a video message after the ruling that it had “strengthened our resolve to continue opening doors.”She will also have to steer the university through a renewed push to end legacy admissions. In July, the U.S. Department of Education launched a civil rights inquiry into the school’s practice citing reports of discrimination.In her speech during her inaugural ceremony, Gay paid tribute to four enslaved African Americans that were owned by the school’s first president.“Bilhah, Titus, Venus and Juba lived and worked in Wadsworth House as the personal property of the president of Harvard University,” she said. “My story is not their story. But our stories and the stories of the many trailblazers between us are linked by this institution's long history of exclusion, and the long journey of resistance and resilience to overcome it.”Gay joined Harvard as a professor of government in 2006 and became a professor of African American studies in 2007. Gay also served as the dean of social sciences from 2015 to 2018.Gay graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire and received her undergraduate degree from Stanford University where she studied economics. She then earned her doctorate from Harvard University in 1998.As president, Gay will also lead Harvard’s multibillion-dollar campus expansion into Boston.\", 'pubDate': 'Fri, 29 Sep 2023 22:16:25 GMT'}, {'title': \"NPR's Aisha Harris argues pop culture is much more than just entertainment\", 'link': 'https://www.wgbh.org/news/local/2023-09-29/nprs-aisha-harris-argues-pop-culture-is-much-more-than-just-entertainment', 'description': 'We sit down with the co-host of \"Pop Culture Happy Hour\" to discuss her new book, \"Wannabe: Reckonings with the Pop Culture That Shapes Me.\"', 'content:encoded': 'As an observant young girl and a curious tween, Aisha Harris, co-host of NPR\\'s Pop Culture Happy Hour, was deeply immersed in pop culture.

And yet, many Latino nonprofits in Massachusetts also struggle to make ends meet — one 2020 report says less than 2% of philanthropic dollars are being directly invested in Latino-based organizations, and nearly 100 new nonprofit organizations would need to be created to fill the current gaps in services to the Latino population.\"Our volunteers can only volunteer for so long,\" Lina Cañon, director of finance operations and development for Chica Project, told Under the Radar. \"And so if you\\'re not paying the women that are in the organization equitable wages and being competitive with the market and allowing them to live in Boston, which we all know is expensive, then how are you actually going to sustain that program?\"Some experts see solutions in policy, and one thing Tomás Gonzalez, director of community and advocacy for Amplify Latinx, wants passed is a bill that would, \"allow for the creation of a micro business development center, which would hope to grant $50,000 grants to folks if they hire individuals from the community, returning citizens, those coming off transition assistance, those that are local to to the establishment, so that you can give that business owner the room that they need.

The Dolphin Rescue Center, located in Orleans and operated by the International Fund for Animal Welfare, plans to treat about twelve stranded dolphins and porpoises on the Cape each year. Before the facility opened up, rescue teams were operating in mobile clinics that could only hold the animals for a few hours, often not long enough to meet their needs. Now, dolphins will be able to receive care for up to four days, enough time to give many of them a fighting chance before being released back into the wild. GBH's All Things Considered host Arun Rath spoke with Sarah Sharp, a rescue animal veterinarian at the Dolphin Rescue Center about the work being done there. What follows is a lightly edited transcript.Rath: So as I mentioned, this is a first of its kind facility for dolphins. Tell us a bit more about why Cape Cod needs this kind of a clinic.Sharp: Absolutely. So Cape Cod, believe it or not, is actually a global hotspot for dolphin strandings. We see the highest frequency of dolphin mass strandings anywhere in the world. This little spit of land that sticks out into the Atlantic Ocean, we have a lot of dolphins that unfortunately get trapped there. So it gives us an incredible opportunity to actually be able to help these animals when they strand alive and to improve the medical care that they need and to put them back out into the wild as quickly as we can. But there are certainly a number of animals where their needs outmatch what we're able to provide in our mobile clinic right now, so this new dolphin rescue center gives us the opportunity to provide that added care that they need [along with] better diagnostics to be making sure that we're making the best decisions for these animals.Rath: So talk us through that process a little bit. What happens when you encounter a stranded animal up to the care point? What's different now about being able to have this long term care?Sharp: We are an organization that's always relied heavily on our volunteers, and so when we get a report of a stranded dolphin on Cape Cod, they're the first ones that we call to go out to the scene, find the animal and give us an update on the condition. When they confirm that it is a live dolphin, our rescue staff heads out in both our mobile clinic and our trucks to be able to access the animal. The animal is assessed in the field and we transport it using specialized stretchers into our mobile rescue clinic. We like to call it Moby for short. Once inside Moby, we can perform diagnostics on it. We can draw blood and run blood in-house there and do a full health assessment. We can do ultrasounds on these animals and find out from that information that we gain whether or not these animals are going to be good release candidates. If they are, then we take them to Provincetown and release them there, which gives us beach access to really deep water, very close to shore and access to good feeding habitats, basically where the whale watches go right off. So its great dolphin habitat, it gives those animals a good chance of survival. For the animals that are not quite healthy enough to be released immediately, those animals now will get a second chance, so they'll be able to come back with us. We'll transport them again in Moby to our dolphin rescue center in Orleans. There we will be able to admit them into one of our medical tanks and do better diagnostics on them, so we'll be able to get a better ultrasound in the pool there, and we'll be able to track their progress over a couple of days after receiving additional treatments to improve their condition. Then once they're ready and healthy enough to be released, we'll do essentially the same release process that we would have done with our other animals, release them back in Provincetown, back into the ocean.Rath: You know, these are obviously large and very strong animals, but the videos and photos that I've seen of the process, it doesn't seem like they're really resisting. Do you get a sense, and it's a strange question, that the dolphins understand that you're helping them out.Sharp: Yeah, it's a really good question and I wish they did. I definitely can say in my over two decades of experience that most animals don't really appreciate the fact that you're trying to help them, unfortunately. When we do have our stranded dolphins, they oftentimes ... kind of lie on the foam mats that we provide for them. But I always tell people, never underestimate a stranded dolphin. They look completely helpless, but they can actually move fairly significantly. They can thrash their tail. They can do a full 360 barrel roll. So they can actually be quite dangerous. We also have safety protocols in place to make sure that people aren't stepping around what we call the danger zone, which is essentially anywhere from the dorsal fin back to the tail. That's an incredibly powerful area. They have impressive muscle structures there, so those animals can do a lot of damage, even though they look fairly harmless as they're lying on the foam mats for us. I wish they knew that we were helping, but we're able to get the job done for them.Rath: Well, makes it all the more intense from the sounds of it. Talk a bit about the release process. I imagine that also has to involve some precautions given the strength of these animals.Sharp: Absolutely. So when we release these animals, we obviously will do a whole briefing with our team before we enter the water so that everybody's aware of what the plan is. We all coordinate that effort significantly among the team. Then once we're in the water, we gauge it based on the conditions. Sometimes when we release, the conditions are beautiful. It's flat and calm out there. There's no waves and we can really take our time and reacclimate the dolphin to the ocean and get them pumping their tail, getting them a little bit more prepared to swim after being on land for a couple of hours. But sometimes we have to release animals into pretty terrible conditions out there just because we hadn't had a choice. So sometimes we can be dealing with waves that are kind of crushing on us and there are significant safety concerns. So that actually is giving us another opportunity through the Dolphin Rescue Center when those release conditions are really not safe for people or for dolphins, we'll be able to bring those animals back to the Dolphin Rescue Center, hold them for a little bit of time until the ocean calms down, and then we'll be able to release them in a much safer condition as well. So the Dolphin Rescue Center is basically going to be able to serve multiple purposes for us that we're thrilled about.Rath: Is there anything that can be done to to minimize dolphin strandings on the Cape, or because of the the geography and the fact that it's got fish that the dolphins want, is it just going to always be a hotspot?Sharp: Yeah, I think that's a great question and one I don't really have a great answer to, other than to say that dolphins have been stranding here for hundreds and hundreds of years. We have seen some changes in recent years, more or less a slow increase over the years in the number of animals that are stranding. We're not exactly sure why that's happening. Certainly there's a lot of changes going on out in the marine environment. The Gulf of Maine in particular is the fastest warming body of water on the planet. So we're certainly starting to see some changes in terms of maybe where the prey distribution is and the dolphins that strand follow the prey. We're seeing some changes in the species that we see strand and the timing of it in terms of when it happens in the year. Traditionally, we always said our busy season was from January to April as well, when we saw all of our dolphin mass strandings, but now it seems to be a bit more spread out year round. So things are definitely changing. It's a dynamic ecosystem, especially with global warming. It's something that we're paying a lot of attention to. I'm not really sure there's much we can do to decrease the number of dolphins that are actually stranding, so our role right now is to improve the survival of the ones that do.Rath: Sarah, it's been great talking with you about this. Really fascinating and wonderful work. Thank you.Sharp: Thanks so much for your interest.\", 'pubDate': 'Fri, 29 Sep 2023 18:03:00 GMT'}, {'title': \"Wu's plan for enforcement at Mass. and Cass faces council questions about existing police efforts\", 'link': 'https://www.wgbh.org/news/local/2023-09-29/wus-plan-for-enforcement-at-mass-and-cass-faces-council-questions-about-existing-police-efforts', 'description': \"City Councilors on opposing sides of the issue raised questions about the efficacy of Wu's plan for Mass. and Cass during a hearing Thursday.\", 'content:encoded': \"Mayor Michelle Wu’s proposed plan to crack down on homeless encampments at the area known as Mass. and Cass faced heated resistance Thursday during a marathon Boston City Council hearing — an eight-hour debate that centered around the efficacy of police enforcement in the troubled area. Wu filed the ordinance in late August, responding to increasing public safety concerns over the summer in the area at the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Melnea Cass Boulevard. The plan would bring in additional police officers to help disperse crowds and enforce a ban on tents and encampments. People living in tents would be given two weeks’ notice to clear makeshift shelters and place their belongings in storage.At the lengthy hearing, the proposal was criticized by normally opposing factions of the council — including conservative councilor Frank Baker and progressive councilors Ricardo Arroyo and Kendra Lara — who questioned if the ordinance would be necessary in an already heavily policed area with existing laws on the books.“There are ways to go in there and go through the population without removal and extreme displacement,” Baker said. “For us to say that we need an ordinance to clear these things is just wasting our time.”Arroyo said making the wrong decision could be fatal. “Unlike other things that we can afford to get wrong, if you get this wrong, more people die. More people are harmed,” he said. “That's a very different consequence. You don't get to unroll that.”Boston Police Commissioner Michael Cox defended the mayor's proposal, stating that removing tents and increasing police presence “will discourage bad actors” who are “looking to victimize the vulnerable while utilizing tents and other temporary structures to conceal their criminal activities.”Cox said that, without a warrant, police entering or searching through someone’s tent could pose a violation of a person's constitutional right against unreasonable searches and seizures. Without the privacy of a tent, he said, “it becomes a lot easier for us to pursue charges.” The ordinance also would help define the role of police officers at Mass. and Cass, Cox said, who have been “reluctant to engage” with people in the area.“Public-police relations during the protest period was, you know, not the best in the world,” Cox said, referencing a series of police brutality protests that began in 2020. “Maybe some officers didn't think that it was appropriate, and rightly so, to engage with people who are suffering from both mental illness and substance use disorders. They thought that maybe it's not our role, because the public was actually saying that.”But many others argued that current laws are enough to address the situation. The American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts submitted a statement to the council urging against giving police additional power.“There are already laws on the books in Massachusetts prohibiting drug trafficking, sexual assault, property crimes, and violence,” the ACLU wrote. “The Boston Police Department (BPD) already has the power to enforce those laws at Mass. and Cass to protect both people living on the street and those living and working in surrounding neighborhoods.”Councilor Lara asked Cox why police would need an ordinance to enforce laws at Mass. and Cass.“Nothing that you have said today has shown me that in order to increase public safety, you need this ordinance,” Lara said. “These are sworn, trained, armed officers. It is their job. And to hear that there is sex trafficking happening, but the police department has their hands tied behind their back and can’t do anything because there’s a tent? It’s unconscionable, especially with the amount of money that we're spending on policing in the city.”Wu filed the proposed ordinance in late August in response to increased public safety concerns, including reports of violence, drug and sex trafficking.Calls to police have increased by 10% as compared to this time last year, and arrests are up 21%, including 10 firearm-related arrests, Cox said. Violent crime is down, and despite a peak of 188 incidents reported to Boston Police in July, this year’s crime rate never reached levels seen during the same time last year, according to the city’s data dashboard.“Even though the data slightly shows a decrease in violent crime during the same period, we believe this is a result of significant under-reporting of crime in the area,” Cox said. “[It’s] not reflective of the true criminality that's actually occurring.”Dr. Bisola Ojikutu, the executive director of the Boston Public Health Commission, said the tents conceal illegal activity and public safety issues including deadly drug overdoses.Between 2019 and 2021, the rate of fatal overdoses in Boston rose by 36%, Ojikutu said. Last year, 352 people died from an overdose. “Those data are basically telling us that we have a huge problem,” she said.Newmarket Business Association president Sue Sullivan argued that tents make criminal activity less visible to police and conceal danger.“I have found people dead in these tents. I have talked to a woman who wasn't allowed out of a tent for three days because a guy was pimping her out in there, and that's just the tip of the iceberg,” Sullivan said. “Drug dealers are down there and they're in the tents, officers can't see them in there. They come and go and do their business, everybody knows it, but [police] can’t arrest them. We need those tents down.”In addition to an increased police presence, Wu’s proposed strategy includes dispatching four teams of outreach workers into neighboring areas and temporarily shutting down the Engagement Center, a city run site opened in 2017 for clinical and social services on nearby Atkinson Street.Wu’s plan would refer people from Mass. and Cass to shelters, if available, and provide transportation to the shelters if requested. A converted office space on Massachusetts Avenue would serve as a temporary overnight shelter for up to 30 people. The Boston Public Health Commission announced Thursday that it no longer plans to set up a clinic at that location.Tania Del Rio, the head of the city's Community Response Team, says outreach teams are working on a list of people and their individual needs — including whether they are amenable to shelter, if they’re seeking treatment or whether they have family members to return to.“This is going to be an ongoing conversation with them as people change their mind every day,” Del Rio said.Since 2019, mayoral administrations have conducted multiple large-scale sweeps of Mass. and Cass.Dr. Lara Jirmanus, the founder of the Massachusetts Coalition for Health Equity, told councilors at the hearing that research shows that police sweeps, tent clearings and dispersing crowds have been ineffective in the past.“I'm concerned that we’re kind of running into a vicious cycle of, you know, sweep, and then we have a couple of years, and then you're kind of back in this vicious cycle again,” Jirmanus said.If approved by a majority of the 13-member city council, the ordinance can go into effect immediately. On Thursday, the council did not vote on the measure. Arroyo, who chairs the council's government operations committee, told GBH News he's locking in a date for a working session ahead of the council's Oct. 30 deadline. If no action is taken by then, the ordinance will automatically go into effect.\", 'pubDate': 'Fri, 29 Sep 2023 16:02:07 GMT'}, {'title': \"The Academy is replacing Hattie McDaniel's Oscar that has been missing for 50 years\", 'link': 'https://www.wgbh.org/news/national/2023-09-29/the-academy-is-replacing-hattie-mcdaniels-oscar-that-has-been-missing-for-50-years', 'description': 'McDaniel, the first Black person to win an Academy Award, donated her Oscar to Howard University before her death.

McDaniel was the first Black person to be nominated for and win an Oscar for her supporting role as Mammy in the 1939 film Gone With the Wind. She went on to act in more than 300 movies, and shortly before her death from breast cancer in 1952, she asked that the Oscar be moved from her home to Howard University in Washington. But the plaque, which preceded the gold statuettes and was given to supporting winners from 1936 to 1942, suddenly disappeared from the school\\'s fine arts building. \"Hattie McDaniel was a groundbreaking artist who changed the course of cinema and impacted generations of performers who followed her,\" Academy Museum Director Jacqueline Stewart and Academy CEO Bill Kramer said in a Tuesday statement. \"We are thrilled to present a replacement of Hattie McDaniel\\'s Academy Award to Howard University.\" Thomas Battle, the former director of the Moorland-Spingarn Research Center at Howard, told NPR in 2009 that he believes the award went missing in the late 1960s or early 1970s, possibly during a period of student unrest. \"But unfortunately all of the principals who would have been involved at the university at that time — administrators and others — are no longer with us, and we have not been able to get the kind of direct information that we would like to be able to pursue this investigation further.\" Denise Randle, who tracked the university\\'s inventory of artifacts beginning in 1972, first said she thought it was thrown away.

Why did it cost so much more in Alaska?', 'link': 'https://www.wgbh.org/news/national/2023-09-29/she-received-chemo-in-two-states-why-did-it-cost-so-much-more-in-alaska', 'description': 'A breast cancer patient who received similar treatments in two states saw significant differences in cost, illuminating how care in remote areas can come with a stiffer price tag.', 'content:encoded': 'Emily Gebel was trying to figure out why she was having trouble breastfeeding. That\\'s when she felt a lump. Gebel, a mother of two children, went to her primary care doctor in Juneau, Alaska, who referred her for testing, she said. Her 9-month-old was asleep in her arms when she got the results. \"I got the call from my primary care nurse telling me it was cancer. And I remember I just sat there for probably at least another half an hour or so and cried,\" Gebel said. Juneau, the state capital, has about 31,700 residents, who are served by the city-owned Bartlett Regional Hospital. But Gebel said she has several friends who have also had cancer, all of whom recommended she seek treatment out of town because they felt bigger cities would have better care. She opted for treatment in Seattle, the closest major American city to Alaska. She underwent surgery at Virginia Mason Medical Center in September 2022. In January, she began chemotherapy at Lifespring Cancer Treatment Center, a stand-alone clinic that she said she selected because it offers a lower-dose chemotherapy. During chemo, she learned she had stage 4 breast cancer, she said. Commuting to Seattle for chemo every week — nonstop flights last as long as two hours and 45 minutes — became tiring. So Gebel began treatment at Bartlett Regional Hospital after her Seattle doctor taught hospital staffers there how to administer her chemo regimen. Then the bill came. The patient: Emily Gebel, 37, insured through her husband\\'s employer by Premera Blue Cross. She was previously covered by Moda Health. Medical service: One round of metronomic chemotherapy, which involves regular infusions at lower but more frequent doses and over a longer period than traditional chemotherapy. Service provider: Bartlett Regional Hospital and Lifespring Cancer Treatment Center. The hospital is a tax-exempt facility owned by the city and borough of Juneau, though most of its revenue comes from the services it provides, according to hospital officials. Lifespring is a stand-alone, doctor-owned cancer clinic in Seattle. Total bill: The prices for Emily\\'s chemo infusions at Bartlett Regional Hospital varied week to week. A hospital bill showed one infusion in July was listed at $5,077.28 — more than three times the price for a similar mix of drugs at the Seattle clinic, $1,611.24. What gives: In the United States, the price for the same medical service can vary based on where it is received. And for those living in remote areas like Alaska, the price difference can put care further out of reach. Emily\\'s firsthand experience with this disparity began after her husband, Jered, requested a cost estimate from Bartlett Regional Hospital. It said Emily\\'s chemo would cost around $7,500 per weekly infusion, more than 4½ times what she had been charged in Seattle. \"The email came through with the bill estimate, and it\\'s like, \\'Oh my goodness, this has to be wrong,\\'\" Jered said. Jered said Emily had met her annual out-of-pocket maximum, meaning her insurance would cover the costs of her treatment, but from the start, the disparity just bothered him. When Emily received a bill for a few rounds of her weekly chemo treatments, it showed that the hospital charged more than triple what the Seattle clinic did for a round of chemo, asking higher prices for every related service and medication she received that week. The hospital charged about $1,000 for the first hour of chemo infusion, which is more than twice the rate at the Seattle clinic. One of Emily\\'s drugs cost $714, more than three times the price at the clinic. It was even the tiniest things: The hospital charged $19.15 for Benadryl, about 22 times the clinic\\'s price of 87 cents. Staff at Lifespring Cancer Treatment Center, the Seattle clinic, did not reply to requests for comment. Sam Muse, the hospital\\'s former chief financial officer who no longer works there, said Bartlett Regional Hospital officials determined prices by looking at average wholesale prices and what other facilities in the region charge. Muse said the hospital had to account for high operating costs. \"Anything that we charge certainly has to take into consideration ... the cost of just supplying healthcare in a rural setting like Juneau,\" Muse said. \"We\\'re not accessible by road at all, only ferry or plane.\" Juneau\\'s isolated geography makes reaching many resources a challenge. The city is part of the Alaska Panhandle, a narrow, island-speckled sliver of the state wedged between Canada, the Pacific Ocean, and Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve. Neither Anchorage nor Vancouver, its nearest major cities, is close by. The hospital — the only one in the city and largest in the panhandle — treats a small number of cancer patients, at least a few hundred last year, Muse said. Its two oncologists live outside the city and fly into Juneau six times a month, said Erin Hardin, a hospital spokesperson. Bartlett spent nearly $11 million last year to pay and fly in nurses, doctors, and other staffers who live outside the city, Muse said. We\\'re \"trying to find that happy medium between keeping care here and keeping costs down and how do we do that in a sustainable way for the long term,\" Muse said. Even though research shows Alaskans seek emergency care and are admitted to the hospital less often than many Americans, they had the third-highest health care expenditures per capita in 2020. \"Alaska is special in that it\\'s small, it\\'s remote, therefore it\\'s more expensive,\" said Mouhcine Guettabi, an associate professor of economics at the University of North Carolina-Wilmington who studied health care costs in Alaska when he taught there. Guettabi said hospitals often need to offer higher wages to recruit doctors and nurses willing to live in Alaska, which has a higher cost of living than most states. Towns or entire regions may have few specialists and only one hospital, creating a dearth of competition that may drive up costs, Guettabi said. It\\'s also more expensive to ship items there, including medical supplies. But Alaska\\'s costs are higher even when taking all those factors into account, Guettabi said. In Anchorage, for instance, prices for medical items increased nearly three times faster from 1991 through 2017 than prices overall. Alaska also has a unique policy that may be increasing prices. Its \"80th percentile rule\" was enacted in 2004 to limit the amount of money patients pay when treated by providers outside their health insurers\\' network. But like many experiments meant to rein in costs, the rule has instead been increasing health care spending, according to a study by Guettabi. \"Critics think the rule may be adding to that soaring spending, partly because over time providers could increase their charges — and insurance payments would have to keep pace,\" the study noted. The resolution: Emily received a bill from the hospital in September, more than five months after beginning treatment there. It said Emily owed about $3,100 even though a previous explanation of benefits said she\\'d met her out-of-pocket limit. Jered said he contacted hospital billing officials, who discovered that a medicine had been incorrectly coded and told Jered that Emily\\'s charge was zero. \"We know how hard it is to pay these ridiculous medical bills,\" Jered said. \"If I\\'m able to push back a little bit against this massive system, well, hey, maybe other people can, too. And who knows, maybe eventually health care prices can come down.\" Emily said she\\'s glad Jered knows how to handle the financial aspects of her care. Like many Americans, she could have just paid or ignored the incorrect bills, risking being sent to collections. \"I can\\'t imagine the amount of time I would have to spend on it while juggling parenting and also dealing with completing treatment, going through the sickness that goes along with that, and just generally feeling very run down,\" she said. The takeaway: Alaska government officials, nonprofits, and experts have suggested methods to lower the cost of health care. The state is considering repealing the 80th percentile rule and implementing value-based care, which emphasizes paying providers based on health outcomes. But what should Alaskans and other patients do in the meantime? If you live in a high-cost state, you might check out prices at a health care system in a state next door. In any case, get ready to advocate for yourself. Jered learned about medical billing by following the Bill of the Month series and reading \"Never Pay the First Bill,\" a book by Marshall Allen, a former ProPublica reporter. Request itemized bills and make sure the codes match the services you received, Jered said. Note any prices that seem outrageous. If you have concerns, arrange an in-person meeting with an official in the provider\\'s finance department. If that\\'s not possible, a phone call is better than email. Make sure to document all conversations, so you have a record. Come prepared with your documents and evidence, including the rate paid by Medicare, the federal insurance system for those 65 and older. Ask the official to explain the reasons for the codes and pricing before contesting anything. You can sometimes negotiate high-priced services down. And remember that the person you\\'re speaking with isn\\'t to blame for your health care costs. \"Don\\'t come at them angry, don\\'t come at them as viewing them as the enemy — because they\\'re not,\" Jered said. \"They are working within the same broken system.\" Emmarie Huetteman of KFF Health News edited the digital story, and Taunya English of KFF Health News edited the audio story.

Wildlife lovers outside of D.C. could see the National Park Service\\'s highly anticipated \"Fat Bear Week\" interrupted as well. Elsewhere, the impacts of a shutdown are likely to snowball as employees go without pay and programs run out of funding to operate. Still — many services will still be available. The Food and Drug Administration will continue \"All vital FDA activities related to imminent threats to the safety of human life,\" Social Security checks will still be issued, Veterans Affairs facilities will remain open. Air traffic and airport personnel will still be on the job, even if without pay, unless employees begin to call in sick to work as they did during the last shutdown. Another institution still running when the money runs out? Congress. They\\'ll keep working without pay, including many of the staffers that keep the Capitol running. Although most major federal agencies have not announced their plans for what would stay open and closed during a potential shut down, here\\'s what we see could be affected and what could continue. Federal employees could be furloughed or asked to work without pay The National Federation for Federal Employees, one of the unions that represents federal workers, estimates that 2.1 million civilian federal workers could see delayed paychecks and roughly 4 million federal contract workers could receive no paycheck. A representative for the Capital Area Food Bank in Washington told NPR the organization is making preparations for as many as 100,000 federal workers who could need food assistance if the government shuts down. Nutrition and food assistance programs could be paused The Agriculture Department, which runs the Supplemental Food Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Women Infants and Children (WIC) programs, is preparing for the nearly 7 million pregnant and postpartum women, infants, and children who rely on WIC to lose access during a shutdown. The USDA Food and Nutrition Service is likely to run out of funding to support normal WIC operations just a few days into a shutdown, according to USDA. The impact on WIC would likely be staggered because some states may have carryover funds or can use their own funds to continue program operations for different amounts of time. Still — Kate Franken, board chair for the National WIC Association, urges families to still seek benefits they think they might qualify for. \"I do think it gets to be really confusing for the public when they see information about a federal government shutdown and wonder what that means for various programs and services that they receive,\" Franken said. \"There\\'s a risk, and we\\'ve experienced this before during shutdowns, where families just sort of assumed that they can\\'t use their benefits or that they shouldn\\'t go to their appointment because services may be closed.\" Households that receive SNAP benefits, formerly known as food stamps, will receive October nutrition assistance as usual regardless of a potential shutdown. It is unknown how November benefits may be impacted should a shutdown persist. Social services for food and education come to a halt Head Start, which supports education for 3- and 4-year-olds across the country, and Meals on Wheels, which brings food to elderly people, could also get interrupted. National Parks are expected to close Visitor centers, campgrounds, research facilities, and museums could be closed for the duration of a shutdown. This would affect events and attractions scheduled for these sites Depending on how long the shutdown persists, this could create interruptions during the Indigenous People\\'s/Columbus Day three-day weekend for many. Last week, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., sent a letter to Interior Secretary Deb Haaland asking the department to use the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act to keep national parks and public lands open during a shut down. Funds from the law were used in 2018 to keep most parks open. Health care is likely to go uninterrupted, but research could pause People who get health care or health insurance from the federal government, whether that\\'s through Medicare or the Indian Health Service, should not experience any interruption in their care. They would still still go to the doctor and still make appointments. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services has enough money to keep paying states for Medicaid and CHIP, the children\\'s health insurance program, for at least for three months. That\\'s good news for around 90 million low-income people who rely on those health insurance programs However, community health centers that get their funding from federal grants could see their funding interrupted by a shutdown. Some clinics are warning they may need to cut back services or staff depending on the timing of the possible shutdown and how long it lasts. Other disruptions could occur at federal health agencies. A report from the Department of Health and Human Services says 42% of agency staff would be furloughed. The National Institutes of Health would furlough nearly 80% of its staff– the only work that would continue is caring for patients at NIH\\'s research hospital. Service members would also work without pay A shutdown would likely affect some 1.3 million active-duty servicemembers who would continue to work but would not get a paycheck. Of the estimated 800,000 Pentagon civilians, some 200,000 would be required to work without pay, because they are \"excepted\" and roles considered \"necessary to protect life and property.\" Another 439,000 of those would stay home without pay, the remainder are paid outside annual appropriations and wouldn\\'t be affected. The White House says all this would be disruptive to national security. The servicemembers are paid twice a month, and the next pay day is Friday, September 29th. Military Commissaries in the U.S. and abroad – which are basically neighborhood grocery stores – will stay open for approximately 60 days into the new fiscal year without appropriations, according to the Defense Department. After the funds run out, only overseas and remote locations will stay open, they warn. The shutdown would also affect those servicemembers scheduled to move to a new assignment. That travel would be halted during a shutdown. Federal law enforcement efforts could slow Larry Cosme, president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, said a lack of funding also means that there are no resources for federal agencies to continue participating in federal-state-local task forces. He said this includes those working on human trafficking investigations, to disrupt terrorist operations, and crack down on drug violations. Copyright 2023 NPR.

Dianne Feinstein of California dies at age 90, sources tell the AP', 'link': 'https://www.wgbh.org/news/national/2023-09-29/democratic-sen-dianne-feinstein-of-california-dies-at-age-90-sources-tell-the-ap', 'description': 'Feinstein, the oldest sitting U.S. senator, said earlier this year she would not run for a sixth term in 2024.', 'content:encoded': 'WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, a centrist Democrat who was elected to the Senate in 1992 in the “Year of the Woman” and broke gender barriers throughout her long career in local and national politics, has died. She was 90.Three people familiar with the situation confirmed her death to The Associated Press on Friday.Feinstein, the oldest sitting U.S. senator, was a passionate advocate for liberal priorities important to her state -- including environmental protection, reproductive rights and gun control -- but was also known as a pragmatic lawmaker who reached out to Republicans and sought middle ground.She was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1969 and became its first female president in 1978, the same year Mayor George Moscone was gunned down alongside Supervisor Harvey Milk at City Hall by Dan White, a disgruntled former supervisor. Feinstein found Milk’s body.After Moscone’s death, Feinstein became San Francisco\\'s first female mayor. In the Senate, she was one of California’s first two female senators, the first woman to head the Senate Intelligence Committee and the first woman to serve as the Judiciary committee’s top Democrat.Although Feinstein was not always embraced by the feminist movement, her experiences colored her outlook through her five decades in politics.\"I recognize that women have had to fight for everything they have gotten, every right,\" she told The Associated Press in 2005, as the Judiciary Committee prepared to hold hearings on President George W. Bush\\'s nomination of John Roberts to replace Sandra Day O\\'Connor on the Supreme Court.\"So I must tell you, I try to look out for women\\'s rights. I also try to solve problems as I perceive them, with legislation, and reaching out where I can, and working across the aisle,\" she said.Her tendency for bipartisanship helped her notch legislative wins throughout her career. But it also proved to be a liability in her later years in Congress, as her state became more liberal and as the Senate and the electorate became increasingly polarized.A fierce debater who did not suffer fools, the California senator was long known for her verbal zingers and sharp comebacks when challenged on the issues about which she was most fervent. But she lost that edge in her later years in the Senate, as her health visibly declined and she often became confused when answering questions or speaking publicly. In February 2023, she said she would not run for a sixth term the next year. And within weeks of that announcement, she was absent for the Senate for more than two months as she recovered from a bout of shingles.Amid the concerns about her health, Feinstein stepped down as the top Democrat on the Judiciary panel after the 2020 elections, just as her party was about to take the majority. In 2023, she said she would not serve as the Senate president pro tempore, or the most senior member of the majority party, even though she was in line to do so. The president pro tempore opens the Senate every day and holds other ceremonial duties.One of Feinstein’s most significant legislative accomplishments was early in her career, when the Senate approved her amendment to ban manufacturing and sales of certain types of assault weapons as part of a crime bill that President Bill Clinton signed into law in 1994. Though the assault weapons ban expired 10 years later and was never renewed or replaced, it was a poignant win after her career had been significantly shaped by gun violence.Feinstein remembered finding Milk’s body, her finger slipping into a bullet hole as she felt for a pulse. It was a story she would retell often in the years ahead as she pushed for stricter gun control measures.She had little patience for Republicans and others who opposed her on that issue, though she was often challenged. In 1993, during debate on the assault weapons ban, Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, accused her of having an insufficient knowledge of guns and the gun control issue.Feinstein spoke fiercely of the violence she’d lived through in San Francisco and retorted: \\'\\'Senator, I know something about what firearms can do.”Two decades later, after 20 children and six educators were killed in a horrific school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, first-term Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas similarly challenged Feinstein during debate on legislation that would have permanently banned the weapons.\"I\\'m not a sixth grader,” Feinstein snapped back at the much younger Cruz -- a moment that later went viral. She added: \"It\\'s fine you want to lecture me on the Constitution. I appreciate it. Just know I\\'ve been here a long time.\"Feinstein became mayor of San Francisco after the 1978 slayings of Moscone and Milk, leading the city during one of the most turbulent periods in its history. Even her critics credited Feinstein with a calming influence, and she won reelection on her own to two four-year terms.With her success and growing recognition statewide came visibility on the national political stage.In 1984, Feinstein was viewed as a vice presidential possibility for Walter Mondale but faced questions about the business dealings of her husband, Richard Blum. In 1990, she used news footage of her announcement of the assassinations of Moscone and Milk in a television ad that helped her win the Democratic nomination for California governor, making her the first female major-party gubernatorial nominee in the state\\'s history.Although she narrowly lost the general election to Republican Pete Wilson, the stage was set for her election to the Senate two years later to fill the Senate seat Wilson had vacated to run for governor.Feinstein campaigned jointly with Barbara Boxer, who was running for the state\\'s other U.S. Senate seat, and both won, benefiting from positive news coverage and excitement over their historic race. California had never had a female U.S. senator, and female candidates and voters had been galvanized by the Supreme Court hearings in which the all-male Senate Judiciary Committee questioned Anita Hill about her sexual harassment allegations against nominee Clarence Thomas.Feinstein was appointed to the Judiciary panel and eventually the Senate Intelligence Committee, becoming the chairperson in 2009. She was the first woman to lead the intelligence panel, a high-profile perch that gave her a central oversight role over U.S. intelligence controversies, setbacks and triumphs, from the killing of Osama bin Laden to leaks about National Security Agency surveillance.Under Feinstein’s leadership, the intelligence committee conducted a wide-ranging, five-year investigation into CIA interrogation techniques during President George W. Bush’s administration, including waterboarding of terrorism suspects at secret overseas prisons. The resulting 6,300-page “torture report” concluded among other things that waterboarding and other \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" did not provide key evidence in the hunt for bin Laden. A 525-page executive summary was released in late 2014, but the rest of the report has remained classified.The Senate investigation was full of intrigue at the time, including documents that mysteriously disappeared and accusations traded between the Senate and the CIA that the other was stealing information. The drama was captured in a 2019 movie about the investigation called “The Report,” and actor Annette Bening was nominated for a Golden Globe for her portrayal of Feinstein.In the years since, Feinstein has continued to push aggressively for eventual declassification of the report.\"It\\'s my very strong belief that one day this report should be declassified,\" Feinstein said. \"This must be a lesson learned: that torture doesn\\'t work.\"Feinstein sometimes frustrated liberals by adopting moderate or hawkish positions that put her at odds with the left wing of the Democratic Party, as well as with the more liberal Boxer, who retired from the Senate in 2017. Feinstein defended the Obama administration’s expansive collection of Americans\\' phone and email records as necessary for protecting the country, for example, even as other Democratic senators voiced protests. “It’s called protecting America,” Feinstein said then.That tension escalated during Donald Trump’s presidency, when many Democrats had little appetite for compromise. Feinstein become the top Democrat on the Judiciary panel in 2016 and led her party’s messaging through three Supreme Court nominations -- a role that angered liberal advocacy groups that wanted to see a more aggressive partisan in charge.Feinstein closed out confirmation hearings for Justice Amy Coney Barrett with an embrace of Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and a public thanks to him for a job well done. “This has been one of the best set of hearings that I’ve participated in,” Feinstein said at the end of the hearing.Liberal advocacy groups that had fiercely opposed Barrett\\'s nomination to replace the late liberal icon Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg were furious and called for her to step down from the committee leadership.A month later, Feinstein announced she would remain on the committee but step down as the top Democrat. The senator, then 87 years old, did not say why. In a statement, she said she would “continue to do my utmost to bring about positive change in the coming years.”Feinstein was born on June 22, 1933. Her father, Leon Goldman, was a prominent surgeon and medical school professor in San Francisco, but her mother was an abusive woman with a violent temper that was often directed at Feinstein and her two younger sisters.Feinstein graduated from Stanford University in 1955, with a bachelor’s degree in history. She married young and was a divorced single mother of her daughter, Katherine, in 1960, at a time when such a status was still unusual.In 1961, Feinstein was appointed by then-Gov. Pat Brown to the women\\'s parole board, on which she served before running for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Typical of the era, much of the early coverage of her entrance into public life focused on her appearance, and she was invariably described as stunning, tall, slender and raven-haired.Feinstein\\'s second husband, Bert Feinstein, was 19 years older than she, but she described the marriage as \"a 10\" and kept his name even after his death from cancer in 1978. In 1980, she married investment banker Richard Blum, and thanks to his wealth, she was one of the richest members of the Senate. He died in February 2022.In addition to her daughter, Feinstein has a granddaughter, Eileen, and three stepchildren.', 'pubDate': 'Fri, 29 Sep 2023 13:13:10 GMT'}]\n",

It is what Harvard was made to do.”Gay also faces a couple of unprecedented challenges as the school’s newest president.Earlier this year, the Supreme Court struck down Harvard University’s race-conscious admissions policy, ending the use of affirmative action.Gay has already been on the job for months, and said in a video message after the ruling that it had “strengthened our resolve to continue opening doors.”She will also have to steer the university through a renewed push to end legacy admissions. In July, the U.S. Department of Education launched a civil rights inquiry into the school’s practice citing reports of discrimination.In her speech during her inaugural ceremony, Gay paid tribute to four enslaved African Americans that were owned by the school’s first president.“Bilhah, Titus, Venus and Juba lived and worked in Wadsworth House as the personal property of the president of Harvard University,” she said. “My story is not their story. But our stories and the stories of the many trailblazers between us are linked by this institution's long history of exclusion, and the long journey of resistance and resilience to overcome it.”Gay joined Harvard as a professor of government in 2006 and became a professor of African American studies in 2007. Gay also served as the dean of social sciences from 2015 to 2018.Gay graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire and received her undergraduate degree from Stanford University where she studied economics.

The Dolphin Rescue Center, located in Orleans and operated by the International Fund for Animal Welfare, plans to treat about twelve stranded dolphins and porpoises on the Cape each year. Before the facility opened up, rescue teams were operating in mobile clinics that could only hold the animals for a few hours, often not long enough to meet their needs. Now, dolphins will be able to receive care for up to four days, enough time to give many of them a fighting chance before being released back into the wild. GBH's All Things Considered host Arun Rath spoke with Sarah Sharp, a rescue animal veterinarian at the Dolphin Rescue Center about the work being done there. What follows is a lightly edited transcript.Rath: So as I mentioned, this is a first of its kind facility for dolphins. Tell us a bit more about why Cape Cod needs this kind of a clinic.Sharp: Absolutely. So Cape Cod, believe it or not, is actually a global hotspot for dolphin strandings. We see the highest frequency of dolphin mass strandings anywhere in the world. This little spit of land that sticks out into the Atlantic Ocean, we have a lot of dolphins that unfortunately get trapped there. So it gives us an incredible opportunity to actually be able to help these animals when they strand alive and to improve the medical care that they need and to put them back out into the wild as quickly as we can. But there are certainly a number of animals where their needs outmatch what we're able to provide in our mobile clinic right now, so this new dolphin rescue center gives us the opportunity to provide that added care that they need [along with] better diagnostics to be making sure that we're making the best decisions for these animals.Rath: So talk us through that process a little bit. What happens when you encounter a stranded animal up to the care point? What's different now about being able to have this long term care?Sharp: We are an organization that's always relied heavily on our volunteers, and so when we get a report of a stranded dolphin on Cape Cod, they're the first ones that we call to go out to the scene, find the animal and give us an update on the condition. When they confirm that it is a live dolphin, our rescue staff heads out in both our mobile clinic and our trucks to be able to access the animal. The animal is assessed in the field and we transport it using specialized stretchers into our mobile rescue clinic. We like to call it Moby for short. Once inside Moby, we can perform diagnostics on it. We can draw blood and run blood in-house there and do a full health assessment. We can do ultrasounds on these animals and find out from that information that we gain whether or not these animals are going to be good release candidates. If they are, then we take them to Provincetown and release them there, which gives us beach access to really deep water, very close to shore and access to good feeding habitats, basically where the whale watches go right off. So its great dolphin habitat, it gives those animals a good chance of survival. For the animals that are not quite healthy enough to be released immediately, those animals now will get a second chance, so they'll be able to come back with us. We'll transport them again in Moby to our dolphin rescue center in Orleans. There we will be able to admit them into one of our medical tanks and do better diagnostics on them, so we'll be able to get a better ultrasound in the pool there, and we'll be able to track their progress over a couple of days after receiving additional treatments to improve their condition. Then once they're ready and healthy enough to be released, we'll do essentially the same release process that we would have done with our other animals, release them back in Provincetown, back into the ocean.Rath: You know, these are obviously large and very strong animals, but the videos and photos that I've seen of the process, it doesn't seem like they're really resisting. Do you get a sense, and it's a strange question, that the dolphins understand that you're helping them out.Sharp: Yeah, it's a really good question and I wish they did. I definitely can say in my over two decades of experience that most animals don't really appreciate the fact that you're trying to help them, unfortunately. When we do have our stranded dolphins, they oftentimes ... kind of lie on the foam mats that we provide for them. But I always tell people, never underestimate a stranded dolphin. They look completely helpless, but they can actually move fairly significantly. They can thrash their tail. They can do a full 360 barrel roll. So they can actually be quite dangerous. We also have safety protocols in place to make sure that people aren't stepping around what we call the danger zone, which is essentially anywhere from the dorsal fin back to the tail. That's an incredibly powerful area. They have impressive muscle structures there, so those animals can do a lot of damage, even though they look fairly harmless as they're lying on the foam mats for us. I wish they knew that we were helping, but we're able to get the job done for them.Rath: Well, makes it all the more intense from the sounds of it. Talk a bit about the release process. I imagine that also has to involve some precautions given the strength of these animals.Sharp: Absolutely. So when we release these animals, we obviously will do a whole briefing with our team before we enter the water so that everybody's aware of what the plan is. We all coordinate that effort significantly among the team. Then once we're in the water, we gauge it based on the conditions. Sometimes when we release, the conditions are beautiful. It's flat and calm out there. There's no waves and we can really take our time and reacclimate the dolphin to the ocean and get them pumping their tail, getting them a little bit more prepared to swim after being on land for a couple of hours. But sometimes we have to release animals into pretty terrible conditions out there just because we hadn't had a choice. So sometimes we can be dealing with waves that are kind of crushing on us and there are significant safety concerns. So that actually is giving us another opportunity through the Dolphin Rescue Center when those release conditions are really not safe for people or for dolphins, we'll be able to bring those animals back to the Dolphin Rescue Center, hold them for a little bit of time until the ocean calms down, and then we'll be able to release them in a much safer condition as well. So the Dolphin Rescue Center is basically going to be able to serve multiple purposes for us that we're thrilled about.Rath: Is there anything that can be done to to minimize dolphin strandings on the Cape, or because of the the geography and the fact that it's got fish that the dolphins want, is it just going to always be a hotspot?Sharp: Yeah, I think that's a great question and one I don't really have a great answer to, other than to say that dolphins have been stranding here for hundreds and hundreds of years. We have seen some changes in recent years, more or less a slow increase over the years in the number of animals that are stranding. We're not exactly sure why that's happening. Certainly there's a lot of changes going on out in the marine environment. The Gulf of Maine in particular is the fastest warming body of water on the planet. So we're certainly starting to see some changes in terms of maybe where the prey distribution is and the dolphins that strand follow the prey. We're seeing some changes in the species that we see strand and the timing of it in terms of when it happens in the year. Traditionally, we always said our busy season was from January to April as well, when we saw all of our dolphin mass strandings, but now it seems to be a bit more spread out year round. So things are definitely changing. It's a dynamic ecosystem, especially with global warming. It's something that we're paying a lot of attention to. I'm not really sure there's much we can do to decrease the number of dolphins that are actually stranding, so our role right now is to improve the survival of the ones that do.Rath: Sarah, it's been great talking with you about this. Really fascinating and wonderful work. Thank you.Sharp: Thanks so much for your interest.\", 'pubDate': 'Fri, 29 Sep 2023 18:03:00 GMT'}, {'title': \"Wu's plan for enforcement at Mass. and Cass faces council questions about existing police efforts\", 'link': 'https://www.wgbh.org/news/local/2023-09-29/wus-plan-for-enforcement-at-mass-and-cass-faces-council-questions-about-existing-police-efforts', 'description': \"City Councilors on opposing sides of the issue raised questions about the efficacy of Wu's plan for Mass. and Cass during a hearing Thursday.\", 'content:encoded': \"Mayor Michelle Wu’s proposed plan to crack down on homeless encampments at the area known as Mass. and Cass faced heated resistance Thursday during a marathon Boston City Council hearing — an eight-hour debate that centered around the efficacy of police enforcement in the troubled area. Wu filed the ordinance in late August, responding to increasing public safety concerns over the summer in the area at the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Melnea Cass Boulevard. The plan would bring in additional police officers to help disperse crowds and enforce a ban on tents and encampments. People living in tents would be given two weeks’ notice to clear makeshift shelters and place their belongings in storage.At the lengthy hearing, the proposal was criticized by normally opposing factions of the council — including conservative councilor Frank Baker and progressive councilors Ricardo Arroyo and Kendra Lara — who questioned if the ordinance would be necessary in an already heavily policed area with existing laws on the books.“There are ways to go in there and go through the population without removal and extreme displacement,” Baker said. “For us to say that we need an ordinance to clear these things is just wasting our time.”Arroyo said making the wrong decision could be fatal. “Unlike other things that we can afford to get wrong, if you get this wrong, more people die. More people are harmed,” he said. “That's a very different consequence. You don't get to unroll that.”Boston Police Commissioner Michael Cox defended the mayor's proposal, stating that removing tents and increasing police presence “will discourage bad actors” who are “looking to victimize the vulnerable while utilizing tents and other temporary structures to conceal their criminal activities.”Cox said that, without a warrant, police entering or searching through someone’s tent could pose a violation of a person's constitutional right against unreasonable searches and seizures. Without the privacy of a tent, he said, “it becomes a lot easier for us to pursue charges.” The ordinance also would help define the role of police officers at Mass. and Cass, Cox said, who have been “reluctant to engage” with people in the area.“Public-police relations during the protest period was, you know, not the best in the world,” Cox said, referencing a series of police brutality protests that began in 2020. “Maybe some officers didn't think that it was appropriate, and rightly so, to engage with people who are suffering from both mental illness and substance use disorders. They thought that maybe it's not our role, because the public was actually saying that.”But many others argued that current laws are enough to address the situation. The American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts submitted a statement to the council urging against giving police additional power.“There are already laws on the books in Massachusetts prohibiting drug trafficking, sexual assault, property crimes, and violence,” the ACLU wrote. “The Boston Police Department (BPD) already has the power to enforce those laws at Mass. and Cass to protect both people living on the street and those living and working in surrounding neighborhoods.”Councilor Lara asked Cox why police would need an ordinance to enforce laws at Mass. and Cass.“Nothing that you have said today has shown me that in order to increase public safety, you need this ordinance,” Lara said. “These are sworn, trained, armed officers. It is their job. And to hear that there is sex trafficking happening, but the police department has their hands tied behind their back and can’t do anything because there’s a tent? It’s unconscionable, especially with the amount of money that we're spending on policing in the city.”Wu filed the proposed ordinance in late August in response to increased public safety concerns, including reports of violence, drug and sex trafficking.Calls to police have increased by 10% as compared to this time last year, and arrests are up 21%, including 10 firearm-related arrests, Cox said. Violent crime is down, and despite a peak of 188 incidents reported to Boston Police in July, this year’s crime rate never reached levels seen during the same time last year, according to the city’s data dashboard.“Even though the data slightly shows a decrease in violent crime during the same period, we believe this is a result of significant under-reporting of crime in the area,” Cox said. “[It’s] not reflective of the true criminality that's actually occurring.”Dr. Bisola Ojikutu, the executive director of the Boston Public Health Commission, said the tents conceal illegal activity and public safety issues including deadly drug overdoses.Between 2019 and 2021, the rate of fatal overdoses in Boston rose by 36%, Ojikutu said. Last year, 352 people died from an overdose. “Those data are basically telling us that we have a huge problem,” she said.Newmarket Business Association president Sue Sullivan argued that tents make criminal activity less visible to police and conceal danger.“I have found people dead in these tents. I have talked to a woman who wasn't allowed out of a tent for three days because a guy was pimping her out in there, and that's just the tip of the iceberg,” Sullivan said. “Drug dealers are down there and they're in the tents, officers can't see them in there. They come and go and do their business, everybody knows it, but [police] can’t arrest them. We need those tents down.”In addition to an increased police presence, Wu’s proposed strategy includes dispatching four teams of outreach workers into neighboring areas and temporarily shutting down the Engagement Center, a city run site opened in 2017 for clinical and social services on nearby Atkinson Street.Wu’s plan would refer people from Mass. and Cass to shelters, if available, and provide transportation to the shelters if requested. A converted office space on Massachusetts Avenue would serve as a temporary overnight shelter for up to 30 people. The Boston Public Health Commission announced Thursday that it no longer plans to set up a clinic at that location.Tania Del Rio, the head of the city's Community Response Team, says outreach teams are working on a list of people and their individual needs — including whether they are amenable to shelter, if they’re seeking treatment or whether they have family members to return to.“This is going to be an ongoing conversation with them as people change their mind every day,” Del Rio said.Since 2019, mayoral administrations have conducted multiple large-scale sweeps of Mass. and Cass.Dr. Lara Jirmanus, the founder of the Massachusetts Coalition for Health Equity, told councilors at the hearing that research shows that police sweeps, tent clearings and dispersing crowds have been ineffective in the past.“I'm concerned that we’re kind of running into a vicious cycle of, you know, sweep, and then we have a couple of years, and then you're kind of back in this vicious cycle again,” Jirmanus said.If approved by a majority of the 13-member city council, the ordinance can go into effect immediately. On Thursday, the council did not vote on the measure. Arroyo, who chairs the council's government operations committee, told GBH News he's locking in a date for a working session ahead of the council's Oct. 30 deadline. If no action is taken by then, the ordinance will automatically go into effect.\", 'pubDate': 'Fri, 29 Sep 2023 16:02:07 GMT'}, {'title': \"The Academy is replacing Hattie McDaniel's Oscar that has been missing for 50 years\", 'link': 'https://www.wgbh.org/news/national/2023-09-29/the-academy-is-replacing-hattie-mcdaniels-oscar-that-has-been-missing-for-50-years', 'description': 'McDaniel, the first Black person to win an Academy Award, donated her Oscar to Howard University before her death. But the plaque mysteriously went missing, likely sometime around the 1960s or 1970s.', 'content:encoded': 'The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is sending Howard University a replacement Oscar for the groundbreaking actress Hattie McDaniel, whose original award has been missing for at least 50 years. McDaniel was the first Black person to be nominated for and win an Oscar for her supporting role as Mammy in the 1939 film Gone With the Wind. She went on to act in more than 300 movies, and shortly before her death from breast cancer in 1952, she asked that the Oscar be moved from her home to Howard University in Washington. But the plaque, which preceded the gold statuettes and was given to supporting winners from 1936 to 1942, suddenly disappeared from the school\\'s fine arts building. \"Hattie McDaniel was a groundbreaking artist who changed the course of cinema and impacted generations of performers who followed her,\" Academy Museum Director Jacqueline Stewart and Academy CEO Bill Kramer said in a Tuesday statement. \"We are thrilled to present a replacement of Hattie McDaniel\\'s Academy Award to Howard University.\" Thomas Battle, the former director of the Moorland-Spingarn Research Center at Howard, told NPR in 2009 that he believes the award went missing in the late 1960s or early 1970s, possibly during a period of student unrest. \"But unfortunately all of the principals who would have been involved at the university at that time — administrators and others — are no longer with us, and we have not been able to get the kind of direct information that we would like to be able to pursue this investigation further.\" Denise Randle, who tracked the university\\'s inventory of artifacts beginning in 1972, first said she thought it was thrown away. Then, she thought it must have been misplaced. Actress Karla Burns, who portrayed McDaniel in the one-woman show Hi-Hat, thought the plaque was stolen. Nevertheless, the new, gifted plaque will be housed in Howard\\'s Chadwick A.

Why did it cost so much more in Alaska?', 'link': 'https://www.wgbh.org/news/national/2023-09-29/she-received-chemo-in-two-states-why-did-it-cost-so-much-more-in-alaska', 'description': 'A breast cancer patient who received similar treatments in two states saw significant differences in cost, illuminating how care in remote areas can come with a stiffer price tag.', 'content:encoded': 'Emily Gebel was trying to figure out why she was having trouble breastfeeding. That\\'s when she felt a lump. Gebel, a mother of two children, went to her primary care doctor in Juneau, Alaska, who referred her for testing, she said. Her 9-month-old was asleep in her arms when she got the results. \"I got the call from my primary care nurse telling me it was cancer. And I remember I just sat there for probably at least another half an hour or so and cried,\" Gebel said. Juneau, the state capital, has about 31,700 residents, who are served by the city-owned Bartlett Regional Hospital. But Gebel said she has several friends who have also had cancer, all of whom recommended she seek treatment out of town because they felt bigger cities would have better care. She opted for treatment in Seattle, the closest major American city to Alaska. She underwent surgery at Virginia Mason Medical Center in September 2022. In January, she began chemotherapy at Lifespring Cancer Treatment Center, a stand-alone clinic that she said she selected because it offers a lower-dose chemotherapy. During chemo, she learned she had stage 4 breast cancer, she said. Commuting to Seattle for chemo every week — nonstop flights last as long as two hours and 45 minutes — became tiring. So Gebel began treatment at Bartlett Regional Hospital after her Seattle doctor taught hospital staffers there how to administer her chemo regimen. Then the bill came. The patient: Emily Gebel, 37, insured through her husband\\'s employer by Premera Blue Cross. She was previously covered by Moda Health. Medical service: One round of metronomic chemotherapy, which involves regular infusions at lower but more frequent doses and over a longer period than traditional chemotherapy. Service provider: Bartlett Regional Hospital and Lifespring Cancer Treatment Center. The hospital is a tax-exempt facility owned by the city and borough of Juneau, though most of its revenue comes from the services it provides, according to hospital officials. Lifespring is a stand-alone, doctor-owned cancer clinic in Seattle. Total bill: The prices for Emily\\'s chemo infusions at Bartlett Regional Hospital varied week to week. A hospital bill showed one infusion in July was listed at $5,077.28 — more than three times the price for a similar mix of drugs at the Seattle clinic, $1,611.24. What gives: In the United States, the price for the same medical service can vary based on where it is received. And for those living in remote areas like Alaska, the price difference can put care further out of reach. Emily\\'s firsthand experience with this disparity began after her husband, Jered, requested a cost estimate from Bartlett Regional Hospital. It said Emily\\'s chemo would cost around $7,500 per weekly infusion, more than 4½ times what she had been charged in Seattle. \"The email came through with the bill estimate, and it\\'s like, \\'Oh my goodness, this has to be wrong,\\'\" Jered said. Jered said Emily had met her annual out-of-pocket maximum, meaning her insurance would cover the costs of her treatment, but from the start, the disparity just bothered him. When Emily received a bill for a few rounds of her weekly chemo treatments, it showed that the hospital charged more than triple what the Seattle clinic did for a round of chemo, asking higher prices for every related service and medication she received that week. The hospital charged about $1,000 for the first hour of chemo infusion, which is more than twice the rate at the Seattle clinic. One of Emily\\'s drugs cost $714, more than three times the price at the clinic. It was even the tiniest things: The hospital charged $19.15 for Benadryl, about 22 times the clinic\\'s price of 87 cents. Staff at Lifespring Cancer Treatment Center, the Seattle clinic, did not reply to requests for comment. Sam Muse, the hospital\\'s former chief financial officer who no longer works there, said Bartlett Regional Hospital officials determined prices by looking at average wholesale prices and what other facilities in the region charge. Muse said the hospital had to account for high operating costs. \"Anything that we charge certainly has to take into consideration ... the cost of just supplying healthcare in a rural setting like Juneau,\" Muse said. \"We\\'re not accessible by road at all, only ferry or plane.\" Juneau\\'s isolated geography makes reaching many resources a challenge. The city is part of the Alaska Panhandle, a narrow, island-speckled sliver of the state wedged between Canada, the Pacific Ocean, and Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve. Neither Anchorage nor Vancouver, its nearest major cities, is close by. The hospital — the only one in the city and largest in the panhandle — treats a small number of cancer patients, at least a few hundred last year, Muse said. Its two oncologists live outside the city and fly into Juneau six times a month, said Erin Hardin, a hospital spokesperson. Bartlett spent nearly $11 million last year to pay and fly in nurses, doctors, and other staffers who live outside the city, Muse said. We\\'re \"trying to find that happy medium between keeping care here and keeping costs down and how do we do that in a sustainable way for the long term,\" Muse said. Even though research shows Alaskans seek emergency care and are admitted to the hospital less often than many Americans, they had the third-highest health care expenditures per capita in 2020. \"Alaska is special in that it\\'s small, it\\'s remote, therefore it\\'s more expensive,\" said Mouhcine Guettabi, an associate professor of economics at the University of North Carolina-Wilmington who studied health care costs in Alaska when he taught there. Guettabi said hospitals often need to offer higher wages to recruit doctors and nurses willing to live in Alaska, which has a higher cost of living than most states. Towns or entire regions may have few specialists and only one hospital, creating a dearth of competition that may drive up costs, Guettabi said. It\\'s also more expensive to ship items there, including medical supplies. But Alaska\\'s costs are higher even when taking all those factors into account, Guettabi said. In Anchorage, for instance, prices for medical items increased nearly three times faster from 1991 through 2017 than prices overall. Alaska also has a unique policy that may be increasing prices. Its \"80th percentile rule\" was enacted in 2004 to limit the amount of money patients pay when treated by providers outside their health insurers\\' network. But like many experiments meant to rein in costs, the rule has instead been increasing health care spending, according to a study by Guettabi. \"Critics think the rule may be adding to that soaring spending, partly because over time providers could increase their charges — and insurance payments would have to keep pace,\" the study noted. The resolution: Emily received a bill from the hospital in September, more than five months after beginning treatment there. It said Emily owed about $3,100 even though a previous explanation of benefits said she\\'d met her out-of-pocket limit. Jered said he contacted hospital billing officials, who discovered that a medicine had been incorrectly coded and told Jered that Emily\\'s charge was zero. \"We know how hard it is to pay these ridiculous medical bills,\" Jered said. \"If I\\'m able to push back a little bit against this massive system, well, hey, maybe other people can, too. And who knows, maybe eventually health care prices can come down.\" Emily said she\\'s glad Jered knows how to handle the financial aspects of her care. Like many Americans, she could have just paid or ignored the incorrect bills, risking being sent to collections. \"I can\\'t imagine the amount of time I would have to spend on it while juggling parenting and also dealing with completing treatment, going through the sickness that goes along with that, and just generally feeling very run down,\" she said. The takeaway: Alaska government officials, nonprofits, and experts have suggested methods to lower the cost of health care. The state is considering repealing the 80th percentile rule and implementing value-based care, which emphasizes paying providers based on health outcomes. But what should Alaskans and other patients do in the meantime? If you live in a high-cost state, you might check out prices at a health care system in a state next door. In any case, get ready to advocate for yourself. Jered learned about medical billing by following the Bill of the Month series and reading \"Never Pay the First Bill,\" a book by Marshall Allen, a former ProPublica reporter. Request itemized bills and make sure the codes match the services you received, Jered said. Note any prices that seem outrageous. If you have concerns, arrange an in-person meeting with an official in the provider\\'s finance department. If that\\'s not possible, a phone call is better than email. Make sure to document all conversations, so you have a record. Come prepared with your documents and evidence, including the rate paid by Medicare, the federal insurance system for those 65 and older. Ask the official to explain the reasons for the codes and pricing before contesting anything. You can sometimes negotiate high-priced services down. And remember that the person you\\'re speaking with isn\\'t to blame for your health care costs. \"Don\\'t come at them angry, don\\'t come at them as viewing them as the enemy — because they\\'re not,\" Jered said. \"They are working within the same broken system.\" Emmarie Huetteman of KFF Health News edited the digital story, and Taunya English of KFF Health News edited the audio story.

Some critical services will continue as employees work without pay.', 'content:encoded': 'Lawmakers are inching closer to a government shutdown when government funding runs out at the end of the day on Sept. 30. With a deal nowhere in sight, federal agencies are bracing to place hundreds of thousands of workers on unpaid furlough until funding is restored. The federal government hasn\\'t faced this dilemma since 2018 when the federal government shut down for 35 days, stretching into the new year in 2019. As in shutdowns past, people across the country will see a pause in federal services, programming and pay. Washington, D.C., residents and visitors could feel the impact quickly. Smithsonian facilities will remain open until money runs out. Then they will close, which could dampen the celebrations to say goodbye to the giant pandas in the National Zoo. Wildlife lovers outside of D.C. could see the National Park Service\\'s highly anticipated \"Fat Bear Week\" interrupted as well. Elsewhere, the impacts of a shutdown are likely to snowball as employees go without pay and programs run out of funding to operate. Still — many services will still be available. The Food and Drug Administration will continue \"All vital FDA activities related to imminent threats to the safety of human life,\" Social Security checks will still be issued, Veterans Affairs facilities will remain open. Air traffic and airport personnel will still be on the job, even if without pay, unless employees begin to call in sick to work as they did during the last shutdown. Another institution still running when the money runs out? Congress. They\\'ll keep working without pay, including many of the staffers that keep the Capitol running. Although most major federal agencies have not announced their plans for what would stay open and closed during a potential shut down, here\\'s what we see could be affected and what could continue. Federal employees could be furloughed or asked to work without pay The National Federation for Federal Employees, one of the unions that represents federal workers, estimates that 2.1 million civilian federal workers could see delayed paychecks and roughly 4 million federal contract workers could receive no paycheck. A representative for the Capital Area Food Bank in Washington told NPR the organization is making preparations for as many as 100,000 federal workers who could need food assistance if the government shuts down. Nutrition and food assistance programs could be paused The Agriculture Department, which runs the Supplemental Food Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Women Infants and Children (WIC) programs, is preparing for the nearly 7 million pregnant and postpartum women, infants, and children who rely on WIC to lose access during a shutdown. The USDA Food and Nutrition Service is likely to run out of funding to support normal WIC operations just a few days into a shutdown, according to USDA. The impact on WIC would likely be staggered because some states may have carryover funds or can use their own funds to continue program operations for different amounts of time. Still — Kate Franken, board chair for the National WIC Association, urges families to still seek benefits they think they might qualify for. \"I do think it gets to be really confusing for the public when they see information about a federal government shutdown and wonder what that means for various programs and services that they receive,\" Franken said. \"There\\'s a risk, and we\\'ve experienced this before during shutdowns, where families just sort of assumed that they can\\'t use their benefits or that they shouldn\\'t go to their appointment because services may be closed.\" Households that receive SNAP benefits, formerly known as food stamps, will receive October nutrition assistance as usual regardless of a potential shutdown. It is unknown how November benefits may be impacted should a shutdown persist. Social services for food and education come to a halt Head Start, which supports education for 3- and 4-year-olds across the country, and Meals on Wheels, which brings food to elderly people, could also get interrupted. National Parks are expected to close Visitor centers, campgrounds, research facilities, and museums could be closed for the duration of a shutdown. This would affect events and attractions scheduled for these sites Depending on how long the shutdown persists, this could create interruptions during the Indigenous People\\'s/Columbus Day three-day weekend for many. Last week, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., sent a letter to Interior Secretary Deb Haaland asking the department to use the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act to keep national parks and public lands open during a shut down. Funds from the law were used in 2018 to keep most parks open. Health care is likely to go uninterrupted, but research could pause People who get health care or health insurance from the federal government, whether that\\'s through Medicare or the Indian Health Service, should not experience any interruption in their care. They would still still go to the doctor and still make appointments. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services has enough money to keep paying states for Medicaid and CHIP, the children\\'s health insurance program, for at least for three months. That\\'s good news for around 90 million low-income people who rely on those health insurance programs However, community health centers that get their funding from federal grants could see their funding interrupted by a shutdown. Some clinics are warning they may need to cut back services or staff depending on the timing of the possible shutdown and how long it lasts. Other disruptions could occur at federal health agencies. A report from the Department of Health and Human Services says 42% of agency staff would be furloughed. The National Institutes of Health would furlough nearly 80% of its staff– the only work that would continue is caring for patients at NIH\\'s research hospital. Service members would also work without pay A shutdown would likely affect some 1.3 million active-duty servicemembers who would continue to work but would not get a paycheck. Of the estimated 800,000 Pentagon civilians, some 200,000 would be required to work without pay, because they are \"excepted\" and roles considered \"necessary to protect life and property.\" Another 439,000 of those would stay home without pay, the remainder are paid outside annual appropriations and wouldn\\'t be affected. The White House says all this would be disruptive to national security. The servicemembers are paid twice a month, and the next pay day is Friday, September 29th. Military Commissaries in the U.S. and abroad – which are basically neighborhood grocery stores – will stay open for approximately 60 days into the new fiscal year without appropriations, according to the Defense Department. After the funds run out, only overseas and remote locations will stay open, they warn. The shutdown would also affect those servicemembers scheduled to move to a new assignment. That travel would be halted during a shutdown. Federal law enforcement efforts could slow Larry Cosme, president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, said a lack of funding also means that there are no resources for federal agencies to continue participating in federal-state-local task forces. He said this includes those working on human trafficking investigations, to disrupt terrorist operations, and crack down on drug violations. Copyright 2023 NPR.

Dianne Feinstein of California, a centrist Democrat who was elected to the Senate in 1992 in the “Year of the Woman” and broke gender barriers throughout her long career in local and national politics, has died. She was 90.Three people familiar with the situation confirmed her death to The Associated Press on Friday.Feinstein, the oldest sitting U.S. senator, was a passionate advocate for liberal priorities important to her state -- including environmental protection, reproductive rights and gun control -- but was also known as a pragmatic lawmaker who reached out to Republicans and sought middle ground.She was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1969 and became its first female president in 1978, the same year Mayor George Moscone was gunned down alongside Supervisor Harvey Milk at City Hall by Dan White, a disgruntled former supervisor. Feinstein found Milk’s body.After Moscone’s death, Feinstein became San Francisco\\'s first female mayor. In the Senate, she was one of California’s first two female senators, the first woman to head the Senate Intelligence Committee and the first woman to serve as the Judiciary committee’s top Democrat.Although Feinstein was not always embraced by the feminist movement, her experiences colored her outlook through her five decades in politics.\"I recognize that women have had to fight for everything they have gotten, every right,\" she told The Associated Press in 2005, as the Judiciary Committee prepared to hold hearings on President George W. Bush\\'s nomination of John Roberts to replace Sandra Day O\\'Connor on the Supreme Court.\"So I must tell you, I try to look out for women\\'s rights. I also try to solve problems as I perceive them, with legislation, and reaching out where I can, and working across the aisle,\" she said.Her tendency for bipartisanship helped her notch legislative wins throughout her career. But it also proved to be a liability in her later years in Congress, as her state became more liberal and as the Senate and the electorate became increasingly polarized.A fierce debater who did not suffer fools, the California senator was long known for her verbal zingers and sharp comebacks when challenged on the issues about which she was most fervent. But she lost that edge in her later years in the Senate, as her health visibly declined and she often became confused when answering questions or speaking publicly. In February 2023, she said she would not run for a sixth term the next year. And within weeks of that announcement, she was absent for the Senate for more than two months as she recovered from a bout of shingles.Amid the concerns about her health, Feinstein stepped down as the top Democrat on the Judiciary panel after the 2020 elections, just as her party was about to take the majority. In 2023, she said she would not serve as the Senate president pro tempore, or the most senior member of the majority party, even though she was in line to do so. The president pro tempore opens the Senate every day and holds other ceremonial duties.One of Feinstein’s most significant legislative accomplishments was early in her career, when the Senate approved her amendment to ban manufacturing and sales of certain types of assault weapons as part of a crime bill that President Bill Clinton signed into law in 1994. Though the assault weapons ban expired 10 years later and was never renewed or replaced, it was a poignant win after her career had been significantly shaped by gun violence.Feinstein remembered finding Milk’s body, her finger slipping into a bullet hole as she felt for a pulse. It was a story she would retell often in the years ahead as she pushed for stricter gun control measures.She had little patience for Republicans and others who opposed her on that issue, though she was often challenged. In 1993, during debate on the assault weapons ban, Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, accused her of having an insufficient knowledge of guns and the gun control issue.Feinstein spoke fiercely of the violence she’d lived through in San Francisco and retorted: \\'\\'Senator, I know something about what firearms can do.”Two decades later, after 20 children and six educators were killed in a horrific school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, first-term Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas similarly challenged Feinstein during debate on legislation that would have permanently banned the weapons.\"I\\'m not a sixth grader,” Feinstein snapped back at the much younger Cruz -- a moment that later went viral. She added: \"It\\'s fine you want to lecture me on the Constitution. I appreciate it. Just know I\\'ve been here a long time.\"Feinstein became mayor of San Francisco after the 1978 slayings of Moscone and Milk, leading the city during one of the most turbulent periods in its history. Even her critics credited Feinstein with a calming influence, and she won reelection on her own to two four-year terms.With her success and growing recognition statewide came visibility on the national political stage.In 1984, Feinstein was viewed as a vice presidential possibility for Walter Mondale but faced questions about the business dealings of her husband, Richard Blum. In 1990, she used news footage of her announcement of the assassinations of Moscone and Milk in a television ad that helped her win the Democratic nomination for California governor, making her the first female major-party gubernatorial nominee in the state\\'s history.Although she narrowly lost the general election to Republican Pete Wilson, the stage was set for her election to the Senate two years later to fill the Senate seat Wilson had vacated to run for governor.Feinstein campaigned jointly with Barbara Boxer, who was running for the state\\'s other U.S. Senate seat, and both won, benefiting from positive news coverage and excitement over their historic race. California had never had a female U.S. senator, and female candidates and voters had been galvanized by the Supreme Court hearings in which the all-male Senate Judiciary Committee questioned Anita Hill about her sexual harassment allegations against nominee Clarence Thomas.Feinstein was appointed to the Judiciary panel and eventually the Senate Intelligence Committee, becoming the chairperson in 2009. She was the first woman to lead the intelligence panel, a high-profile perch that gave her a central oversight role over U.S. intelligence controversies, setbacks and triumphs, from the killing of Osama bin Laden to leaks about National Security Agency surveillance.Under Feinstein’s leadership, the intelligence committee conducted a wide-ranging, five-year investigation into CIA interrogation techniques during President George W. Bush’s administration, including waterboarding of terrorism suspects at secret overseas prisons. The resulting 6,300-page “torture report” concluded among other things that waterboarding and other \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" did not provide key evidence in the hunt for bin Laden. A 525-page executive summary was released in late 2014, but the rest of the report has remained classified.The Senate investigation was full of intrigue at the time, including documents that mysteriously disappeared and accusations traded between the Senate and the CIA that the other was stealing information. The drama was captured in a 2019 movie about the investigation called “The Report,” and actor Annette Bening was nominated for a Golden Globe for her portrayal of Feinstein.In the years since, Feinstein has continued to push aggressively for eventual declassification of the report.\"It\\'s my very strong belief that one day this report should be declassified,\" Feinstein said. \"This must be a lesson learned: that torture doesn\\'t work.\"Feinstein sometimes frustrated liberals by adopting moderate or hawkish positions that put her at odds with the left wing of the Democratic Party, as well as with the more liberal Boxer, who retired from the Senate in 2017. Feinstein defended the Obama administration’s expansive collection of Americans\\' phone and email records as necessary for protecting the country, for example, even as other Democratic senators voiced protests. “It’s called protecting America,” Feinstein said then.That tension escalated during Donald Trump’s presidency, when many Democrats had little appetite for compromise. Feinstein become the top Democrat on the Judiciary panel in 2016 and led her party’s messaging through three Supreme Court nominations -- a role that angered liberal advocacy groups that wanted to see a more aggressive partisan in charge.Feinstein closed out confirmation hearings for Justice Amy Coney Barrett with an embrace of Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and a public thanks to him for a job well done. “This has been one of the best set of hearings that I’ve participated in,” Feinstein said at the end of the hearing.Liberal advocacy groups that had fiercely opposed Barrett\\'s nomination to replace the late liberal icon Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg were furious and called for her to step down from the committee leadership.A month later, Feinstein announced she would remain on the committee but step down as the top Democrat. The senator, then 87 years old, did not say why. In a statement, she said she would “continue to do my utmost to bring about positive change in the coming years.”Feinstein was born on June 22, 1933. Her father, Leon Goldman, was a prominent surgeon and medical school professor in San Francisco, but her mother was an abusive woman with a violent temper that was often directed at Feinstein and her two younger sisters.Feinstein graduated from Stanford University in 1955, with a bachelor’s degree in history. She married young and was a divorced single mother of her daughter, Katherine, in 1960, at a time when such a status was still unusual.In 1961, Feinstein was appointed by then-Gov. Pat Brown to the women\\'s parole board, on which she served before running for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Typical of the era, much of the early coverage of her entrance into public life focused on her appearance, and she was invariably described as stunning, tall, slender and raven-haired.Feinstein\\'s second husband, Bert Feinstein, was 19 years older than she, but she described the marriage as \"a 10\" and kept his name even after his death from cancer in 1978. In 1980, she married investment banker Richard Blum, and thanks to his wealth, she was one of the richest members of the Senate. He died in February 2022.In addition to her daughter, Feinstein has a granddaughter, Eileen, and three stepchildren.', 'pubDate': 'Fri, 29 Sep 2023 13:13:10 GMT'}, {'title': 'The magic of skipping stones at Lake Paran in Bennington', 'link': 'https://www.wgbh.org/news/local/2023-09-29/the-magic-of-skipping-stones-at-lake-paran-in-bennington', 'description': 'The 10th annual Lake Paran Stone Skipping Competition was held on Sept. 16 in Bennington.', 'content:encoded': 'When Benjamin Ohmer released his prize winning toss at the 10th annual Lake Paran Stone Skipping Competition in North Bennington, he knew it was a good throw. Ben, who is 6, got his stone to skip 22 times across the surface of the lake, enough to take first prize in his age group. “I started to see it started skipping and I was like, ‘That’s ‘gonna be a lot,” he said, after collecting his first-prize trophy. “It was the most I ever got in a competition.” Ben traveled out to Lake Paran with his family from their home in northwestern Pennsylvania to take part in the competition, one of only a handful of organized stone skipping events in the country. His father, Dave Ohmer, who’s won five first place prizes at the Franklin, Pennsylvania championship, said stone skipping has become a way to explore new places with his family, teach and learn new skills, and get his four boys to work together and not fight, even it’s for just a few hours. “Core part of our family, man,” he said. “I’ve been doing it for as long as, since before I was a father, I’ve been going to competitions. So all my kids kind of grew up, all of our little family get-aways on the weekends were, you know, were throwing rocks.” Lake Paran is a dammed reservoir, in the southwestern corner of Vermont. There’s a public beach and day camps during the summer, a fundraising Paran Plunge in February and year-round environmental walks and activities. “Paran is a really important resource in this community,” said Alisa Del Tufo, chair of Paran Recreations, the nonprofit organization that manages the lake. “We are a very welcoming place for the whole community, and we also are environmental stewards for you know, a part of our environment that\\'s under a lot of stress right now, with everything from the weeds and flooding, to more heat and just everything that people are dealing with all over the state.” She said the stone skipping competition doesn’t really bring in too much money. Admission is free, and the adult stone skippers only pay $10 to register. But on this day, when more than a hundred people came out to watch, and stone skippers from across the country and Canada drove over to Bennington County for a chance to win a bag of fudge, Del Tufo said the day’s been a success. “We are always looking for more attention from the folks up in Montpelier, because being down in this southern corner of the state we often don’t get the attention that we think we should be getting,” Del Tufo said. “So we really are interested in bringing as many people here as we can to enjoy the beauty of this place.\" There are only three other stone skipping competitions in the country, according to Del Tufo, and the event here at Lake Paran is divided between age groups and skill levels. Three judges sit up on park benches, looking over the lake, doing their best to count how many times the stone skims across the surface. There are no real rules, except that the stones have to be natural and unaltered. No shaving or smoothing. “Stone skipping is fun because it’s magic,” said Ezra Feldman, who was competing in the Lake Paran event for the first time. “The stone is supposed to sink, and it just floats on top of the surface of the water.” Feldman said he grew up skipping stones, whenever he found himself along a body of water with good rocks nearby, and he never thought much about it before he found himself on a crowded, public beach with crowds of other people skipping stones. “It’s amazing,” he said. “And you start thinking about how it works. And why it spins, and why it skips better when it spins, and what kind of edges you should have, and whether a round stone is better than a kind of square stone, and if you have a stone with a little bit of a dome and a flat edge, like which one is better to skip on. And I’m in the amateurs because I don’t know. But it’s fun.” In between the various levels of competitions everyone made their way down to the lake to practice, compare stones and talk strategy. This was the third year Arlo Kent came down with his family to Lake Paran from their home in Stowe. Arlo is 13, and he was competing at the professional level this year after scoring really well at last year’s competition. He said he’s been watching the pros and learning what he can while developing his own style. “I’m really trying to just refine my technique,” said Arlo. “I’m testing out all the different ways to throw it. I’m working on the angle of the rock itself, and also the angle that you throw it at. And I’m also learning from a few pros, their techniques. Yeah, it’s just a fun competition. Everyone here is very friendly. And, you know, I like to see how many skips I can get.” Arlo went head-to-head with some of the best stone skippers in the country. And, he didn’t make it out of the first round. But he said he’ll keep skipping stones on the Little River, which runs through his town, and he’ll be back next year. Have questions, comments or tips?
