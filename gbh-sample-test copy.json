        "body": "Thomas White, a senior at Boston Latin School, is like a lot of high school athletes. A cross country runner, he trained hard all summer in hopes a season would happen.And, to his surprise, it did. But it wasn't without restrictions.\u201cThe state \u2026 didn\u2019t really know what was safe or not safe. So everything kept getting pushed back,\" said White's coach, Chris Blondin. \"And we were just praying that it wouldn\u2019t end up like the spring season where it outright got cancelled. So the fact that we even have a season at all is just a blessing.\u201dBut then, in the last week of October, Boston Public Schools postponed the few athletic activities it was allowing, essentially killing the BLS season. It's just one example of the dark hole that high school sports have been thrown into during the pandemic. And even for the sports and districts that are still going, a season can seem like a countdown to the inevitable postponement or cancellation. And for White, and other high school seniors like him, that uncertainty about what happens next may be the common refrain as they attempt to navigate through the haze of COVID-19.More from COVID And The ClassroomFor the full story, click on the audio player button above.

        "body": "A wave of blue votes could wash over the Massachusetts State House's small Republican caucus this election, but local political experts say that voters may be more than willing to keep conservatives on Beacon Hill even if most Bay Staters want to reject President Trump.Tuesday's election is expected to draw as many as 3.5 million Massachusetts ballots through the mail and in person, energized by Massachusetts voters' zeal to replace Trump, who lost to Hillary Clinton here 61 percent to 33 percent in 2016.Georgetown Republican Rep. Lenny Mirra knows what he's up against as he runs for a fourth term and that \"there are a lot of people that won't vote for Republicans because of Donald Trump.\"\"Even though a state legislator has nothing to do with the president, there are people that will say, no, you're on the 'red team' and Donald Trump is on the 'red team', therefore I'm not voting for you,\" Mirra told GBH News. \"There are people like that. There's a lot of people like that,\" he said.Stonehill College political scientist Peter Ubertaccio said the national political mood is not always a good barometer of what's happening at the local level and that Republicans that focus on the district and not the White House can survive Democratic challenges even when the winds are blowing against the GOP.\"Voters will make a distinction between a presidential candidate or president they don't like,\" Ubertaccio said, \"The work of a state legislator is so different than the way in which a president is perceived in a locality that they can, in fact, overcome.\"Trump will likely lose to Joe Biden throughout Massachusetts, but areas like Worcester and Barnstable County could show slimmer Democratic victory margins than the deepest blue precincts of the Commonwealth. On the Cape this year, Republicans are defending three contiguous seats from the bridges to Brewster that Democrats think they can pick up.Republican Rep. Randy Hunt's retirement from the Fifth Barnstable district leaves retired Yarmouth deputy police chief and Republican candidate Steven Xiarhos running to replace him on Beacon Hill against Democratic opponent Jim Dever, an attorney and Sandwich school committee member.Xiarhos has tied himself closer to President Trump than most Massachusetts Republicans, close enough in fact to have to quarantine after attending a White House function and possible COVID-19 outbreak in September.Ubertaccio thinks Xiarhos will have a harder time retaining Hunt's GOP seat as a newcomer than Rep. Will Crocker will have defending his Hyannis-based seat against Democrat Kip Diggs.\"There's an excellent chance that the Republicans keep the seat in Hyannis. But there's an equally good chance that they may lose it in Sandwich simply because they don't have an incumbent running for reelection and the calculation is very different in voters' minds,\" Ubertaccio said.Former Massachusetts Senate Minority Leader, and veteran of congressional and statewide campaigns, Richard Tisei agrees that any Republican \"sitting back and resting on your laurels\" is going to have a problem this election cycle.\"But if you've been out and you're connected to the community and you've been doing the work, if you're not taking anything for granted and you're running an aggressive campaign, I think you'll make it through whatever storm should be coming in November,\" Tisei told GBH News.If Republicans do lose any of the 13 seats the party is defending this cycle, not much may change in the Democrat-dominated House, where Speaker Robert DeLeo's caucus already has a 127-to-31 advantage.Democratic political strategist Jay Cincotti said an even slimmer Republican caucus emerging from 2020 with fewer moderates from \"purple\" districts would leave a leaner, meaner GOP.\"It probably does empower the extremes of the party with respect to the minority party in this case. So I think if you saw Democratic gains, I think we would see an emboldened extreme right sort of get more noisy,\" Cincotti said.A larger Democratic majority would make it easier for Democrats to override Gov. Charlie Baker's occasional veto, but by flipping vulnerable \"purple\" seats now held by Republicans into the Democratic column, DeLeo could find himself with a greater number of moderate members less willing to take on contentious progressive goals.A counterexample was what happened in the state Senate when it's GOP caucus shriveled to one-tenth of the chamber and Democrats used the super-majority to force a more progressive agenda than had been seen before.\"I think the increase of a Democratic majority will embolden the progressive to try to get louder and to advocate for their positions more aggressively,\" Cincotti said.However the election goes, Tisei is confident that the conservative message of Governors Baker, Jane Swift, Paul Cellucci and Bill Weld will be represented on Beacon Hill. Tisei called Republicans that hold Democratic-leaning seats \"above average to exceptional,\" in their political skill and bipartisanship.\"They're all superstars in their own right that they were able to get elected in Massachusetts in the first place,\" Tisei said.",

        "body": "Lauren Berglund\u2019s journey to voting this year began back in December, shortly after she moved from her home state of Iowa to Saint James, New York, a small hamlet on the north shore of Long Island about an hour from New York City. At the time, the 2020 election was almost a year away \u2014 but based on past experience, Berglund knew that she needed to start getting organized to vote early.That\u2019s because Berglund, who was born with a genetic condition causing significant vision loss, is legally blind. \u201cI wanted to be able to vote independently,\u201d she said, as she had done in previous elections in Iowa.So, she made an appointment at her local Department of Motor Vehicles to officially change her residency to New York, which would then allow her to register to vote in the state. That way, she could head to the polls in person and take advantage of the accessible voting machines required by law to be available at her local polling center. But then the coronavirus pandemic hit.With her DMV appointment cancelled indefinitely, Berglund reset her sights on voting by absentee ballot from her permanent address in Iowa, where she was already registered to vote. There was just one problem: Berglund is not able to read paper or fill in the bubbles that make up a typical mail-in ballot. Once her absentee ballot application arrived, she used an app on her phone to scan it and send it to her computer, where she used software to have the form read aloud back to her. She then converted the form to a fillable PDF so that she could complete the fields with the help of her computer. Then came the problem of sending the application back \u2014 which she had to do not once, but twice, as the first time there was a problem with her registration. Unable to drive, and weary of taking public transportation during the pandemic, she would need to arrange for a safe ride to the post office in order to drop off her application. She knew that would be a hassle to schedule and could also lead to  unwanted exposure to the virus, so she sent the first form back to her mother in Iowa, who walked it into her hometown\u2019s municipal office. A chance run-in with her local postal worker on the street outside her place saved her the second time, as she was able to give him the application directly.\u201cThankfully I had that choice, and someone to help, or this wouldn\u2019t have worked anyway,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really does take a village.\u201dAnd then, finally, her absentee ballot arrived from Iowa \u2014 complete with the bubbles, columns, and signature fields that are so common on most voting ballots.Using her scanning app, she was able to read the ballot, \u201cBut as I was filling it out, I couldn\u2019t tell if I was inside the bullets or not,\u201d she said. Mom to the rescue once again; Berglund FaceTimed her mother to help her read through the ballot and then guide her to fill out the bubbles next to her choices.\u201cI did the best I could,\u201d Berglund said. \u201cBut I did not get to vote independently or privately. Thankfully, I have similar [political] views to my mom, because she helped me fill out the entire thing.\u201dHer completed ballot finally in hand, Berglund knew she couldn't rely on running into her local postal worker again to send it back. So she risked a bus ride to the post office to drop it into the mail herself. After checking the online ballot tracker every single day afterward \u2014 \u201cthankfully, that part was accessible,\u201d she said \u2014 to make sure that it arrived in Iowa safe and sound, it finally came back showing that her ballot had been officially cast \u2014 and her voice officially heard.In the end, Berglund, who works for an organization that places guide dogs with veterans, first responders, and blind individuals, was frustrated by her voting experience, but also somewhat relieved that she didn\u2019t have to brave the polls in person. Due to a connective tissue disease, she is unable to stand comfortably for more than 15 minutes at a time. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the reports of lines that are three blocks long, and there is just no way,\u201d she said.She noted that it\u2019s more difficult for her to maintain the recommended six-feet of social distance because she can\u2019t see to accurately gauge the space between her and the people around her. In addition, her guide dog, Sami, is trained to head right for the door, not to wait in line. And the need for working in close contact with a sighted guide for assistance with the voting machines would have put her at additional risk of exposure for the virus. \u201cI can\u2019t see if someone is wearing a mask properly, so I just hope for the best,\u201d she said.And that\u2019s if the accessible voting machines were even setup and working properly, which Berglund has found in past experience isn\u2019t always the case.\u201cIt would not have been fun to go through all of the trouble to get [to the polls] and then be like \u2018oh shucks,\u2019\u201d without an accessible machine to vote on, she said.Despite the many challenges of voting this year \u2014 in fact, because of them \u2014 Berglund had a strong message for other voters, regardless of disability.\u201cDon\u2019t take your ability to vote easily for granted. Take advantage of it. If you can easily get out and vote, do it,\u201d she said. She also implored people to be kind to one another at the polls. \u201cIt could have taken a lot for some people just to get there,\u201d she said.Berglund\u2019s hope is that the heightened awareness of social injustices that has taken hold across the country will not stop once Election Day is over. \u201cPeople are thinking about things they haven\u2019t always been thinking about, especially when it comes to marginalized communities,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fight is ongoing and always will be.\"",

        "body": "It\u2019s unlikely Donald Trump will win Massachusetts this week, and even more unlikely likely he\u2019ll win Boston, where Hillary Clinton got 81 percent of the vote in 2016. But in one small pocket of the city, the odds of a Trump victory are actually pretty good.Maureen Feeney, the former Boston City Councilor and current city clerk, has lived in the area in question \u2014 Ward 16, Precinct 12 \u2014 for half a century. (On a map of Boston, it\u2019s the city\u2019s southeastern tip, right across the Neponset River from Quincy and Milton.) It is, Feeney says, a place where voting is a social event.\u201cYou\u2019d have cake sales from St. Brendan\u2019s grammar school, people talking and holding signs, giving jabs here and there,\u201d Feeney said. \u201cIt\u2019s just always been a critically important component of living in this neighborhood.\"In addition, Feeney says, 16-12 can feel like a world unto itself, where the same families living side by side for generations creates what feels like a small town in the midst of the city.\u201cSo many of the people who\u2019ve lived here have married or whatever and have bought their parents\u2019 house, or a neighbor\u2019s house,\u201d Feeney said. \u201cI see Brian and Stevie and Amanda and they\u2019re all bringing their kids \u2014 but they used to walk by my house when they were going to school.\u201d If you\u2019re an outsider and visit 16-12, you\u2019ll probably notice Florian Hall, the headquarters for the Boston Firefighters Union. The streets are full of single- and two-family homes with well-kept yards decked out for Halloween \u2014 not to mention a lot of American flags. Florian Hall, the headquarters of the Boston firefighter's union (side view)You might not see a single 'Donald Trump for President' sign. But that absence is deceptive.\u201c[Trump] didn\u2019t win a single precinct in Boston, but he came damn close in 16-12,\u201d said Yawu Miller, the senior editor of the Bay State Banner. \u201cHe got 46 percent of the vote.\u201dEvery election cycle, Miller studies Boston\u2019s election returns, looking for unusual results. And every election, 16-12 stands out. In 2017, for example, Mayor Marty Walsh crushed challenger Tito Jackson, winning a whopping 95 percent of the vote. And in 2018, when Rachael Rollins won the Democratic primary in the Suffolk County District Attorney\u2019s race, her push for criminal justice reform drew support citywide \u2014 but not here. \u201cShe received 20 votes,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAnd Greg Henning. the candidate who was backed by the police unions, received 360 votes.\u201dLarry DiCara, the former Boston City Councilor and mayoral candidate, says that outcome \u2014 and Trump\u2019s strong performance two years earlier \u2014 may reflect the fact that 16-12 is packed with residents who work in public safety. A homemade sign supporting police on Whitridge Street in Boston's Ward 16, Precinct 12\u201cIt\u2019s a neighborhood with a high percentage of people who are police and fire, and police have strongly supported Donald Trump,\u201d DiCara said. \u201cCertainly in the great debate about reforming the police department, and issues of liability, Donald Trump stands with the police, notwithstanding that generally, he\u2019s anathema to organized labor.\u201dMany firefighters are standing with the police during that debate, too \u2014 including their statewide union, the Professional Fire Fighters of Massachusetts, whose website laments \u201cunrelenting attacks\u201d on \u201cour Brothers and Sisters in blue.\u201dBut DiCara said he believes the roots of 16-12\u2019s unusual political identity go back further. He points to 1983, when Ronald Reagan stopped by the Eire Pub \u2014 a literal stone\u2019s throw from the precinct\u2019s northwestern corner \u2014 for a beer and some potent cultural symbolism. \u201cRonald Reagan was able to relate to white, middle-class people far better than any Republican had up to that time,\u201d DiCara said. \u201cThe Eire Pub visit was a real message that \u2018I\u2019m one of you folks, I\u2019m one of the guys! I\u2019ll have a cold one at the Eire!\u2019\u201d Back then, DiCara says, you could find precincts like 16-12 throughout the city.\u201cThese are churchgoing people,\u201d DiCara said. \u201cThe majority of them are white. The great majority of them are Irish. [They\u2019re] very set in their ways, and that includes politics.\u201dModuleNow, as affluent newcomers gentrify Boston, 16-12 has ceased to be representative. Instead, it\u2019s an outlier.Still, one big question remains: How could so many voters back Trump one year and Walsh, a vocal Trump critic, the very next?DiCara notes that when Walsh was a state represenative, 16-12 was part of his district.\u201cHe knows almost everyone in that precinct by first name,\u201d DiCara said of Walsh. \u201cHe knows when Johnny\u2019s going to graduate from B.C. High, or Mary\u2019s going to graduate from UMass Boston, or whatever the case might be.\u201dBut Miller has a different explanation. \u201cPeople used to say people would vote primarily on ethnicity in Boston, next on neighborhood \u2014 they\u2019d vote for somebody from the neighborhood regardless of their ethnicity \u2014 and ideology was like the last thing,\u201d Miller said. \u201cSo it was always more tribal.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s beginning to flip \u2026 almost everywhere, except that little section,\" he said. On Tuesday, as Boston\u2019s presidential results trickle in with what\u2019s likely to be a minimal amount of drama, that little section might just be a national bellwether, telling us if Trump\u2019s white, working-class support is as strong as it was four years ago.

        "body": "The state Department of Public Health released new details last week about the sources of COVID-19 clusters in Massachusetts, using data from the state's contact tracing efforts. But in some ways, the data raise more questions than answers.While Gov. Charlie Baker and other public officials have repeatedly said the biggest risk of infection was coming from social gatherings, particularly among young people, the data show that the vast majority of COVID-19 clusters were traced back to transmission within households. A household \"cluster\" is defined as two or more people living at the same address who were infected within four weeks of each other. The state's weekly COVID-19 report, released Thursday, stated that there have been 3,854 such household clusters in the state, leading to 7,428 confirmed cases. By comparison, contact tracing found 33 clusters that could be traced back to social gatherings, leading to 79 confirmed cases. Those clusters led to testing of another 96 \"close contacts,\" who were found not to be infected.Long-term care facilities were the second most common setting for clusters, with 141 clusters leading to 811 cases. Fifty-five child care clusters led to 78 coronavirus infections.Epidemiologists and infectious disease experts say the rate of spread within households is unsurprising.\"It's an issue of proximity and duration,\" said Dr. Erica Shenoy, associate chief of the Infection Control Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital. \"We spend a lot of time in our home together. And if there are more of us in close quarters, it provides more opportunity for the infection to spread.\"That is a factor in the higher rates seen in many of the state's lower income communities, said Dr. Paul Biddinger, chief of the Division of Emergency Preparedness at MGH, and director of the MGH Center for Disaster Medicine. \"I think [it] underscores some of the disparities that we see in transmission, where communities with high housing density, high number of people in any given household, especially multi-generational, remains a significant risk,\" Biddinger said. People let their guard down at home, said Tory Mazzola, a spokesperson for the state COVID-19 Command Center, in a statement. \"It's critical that residents are aware of this and -- especially those living in multi-generational homes or with family members who have underlying conditions -- take precautions even in their home, such as wearing a mask, washing hands and not sharing utensils, as a few examples.\" But household clusters don't happen in isolation. Someone still has to get infected somewhere else and bring the virus into a home. The new data doesn't shed much light on where those infections are happening.  The cases the state was able to trace to clusters account for 54 percent of the more than 150,000 confirmed cases the state has seen since the beginning of the pandemic.\"The case investigations and the tracing that we're doing is showing us that there is not one reason. There's not these super-spreader events that you see in other places,\" Boston Chief of Health and Human Services Marty Martinez said in a press call Friday.\"There's a lot of small little scenarios that are happening that is really increasing the spread, especially in different neighborhoods and different communities,\" he said. And that, Martinez said, underscores the need for people to wear masks and keep their distance when out in public.\"Massachusetts, I think, in general, has done a pretty good job at social distancing and mask wearing and things like that,\" Dr. Michael Mina of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health said in a press call Friday. \"Of course, we've seen even in Massachusetts that people are getting tired. People are going back to work. People are going back to school. And so community transmission is increasing again. And that will cause exponential increase through the households.\"And people infected in those households, he added, then go back out into the community and infect others.More than a third of the state's communities are now in the so-called \"red zone,\" meaning over the last two weeks, they've reported more than eight cases per day on average, per 100,00 residents. That's almost double the number of cities and towns in the red zone two weeks ago. The state as a whole is in the red zone for the third week in a row. Hospitalizations and deaths have been climbing steadily since early September, though not as sharply as the daily case counts. But that could change if the rising number of cases translates into more severely sick people.With the data from the state's contact tracing efforts showing that household transmission was the single biggest risk for clusters, the upcoming holidays could result in an additional spike in cases, as visiting family members and friends essentially increase the size of households overnight.\"We are all looking for connections, we all miss our families. We all want to have some joy at the holiday time and I very, very much appreciate that,\" said Biddinger. \"But I think hopefully people will try to find ways to have joy and to connect with their families in a way that doesn't significantly increase transmission. Because if we disregard the virus and just gather together without precautions, what happens in December and January could be very concerning.\"GBH News' Mark Herz contributed to this report.Correction: This story has been updated to correct the percentage of total infections the state has been able to trace to clusters.",

        "body": "A couple of years ago, Daymian Mejia, a senior at Lesley University in Cambridge, began experiencing thoughts of self-harm and suicidal ideation. The son of Dominican immigrants, the 23-year-old from Jamaica Plain is the first in his family to go to college. At Lesley, he studies digital film. He also has a mood swing disorder, which he said \"becomes like a tint over everything.\" \u201cEvery single emotion, everything that you do, just feels like it's somewhat distorted,\u201d Mejia said.   A young Latino attending a predominantly white school, Mejia said he had felt isolated on campus even before the pandemic.\u201cI could count every single person of color in the film program,\u201d he said. \u201cYou walk into a room and culturally, you know that there's no type of connection. I grew up very Americanized, but regardless, even just looking at this skin, there's a disconnect.\u201dNational data show Mejia, who is brown-skinned, is far from alone in feeling disconnected on campus. A national survey conducted this fall found 90 percent of students are experiencing stress or anxiety as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, and one in four say their depression has significantly increased since March. Students from historically underrepresented groups \u2014 Black, Latino and Native American students \u2014 were more likely to report they\u2019re stressed and depressed on campus and that they lack a sense of belonging, according to the survey of 2,000 college and high school students for Active Minds, a nonprofit that promotes mental health awareness among students.That disturbing trend is constant among both undergrads and graduate students, said Tabbye Chavous, director of the National Center for Institutional Diversity at the University of Michigan.\u201cLatinx, Middle Eastern and Arab American students may be particularly likely to report anti-immigrant treatment, regardless of their actual immigrant status,\u201d she said during a recent forum event hosted by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Chavous' research finds that since March, Asian and Asian-American students are reporting increased xenophobia made worse by the pandemic and anti-immigrant political rhetoric. And Black students are also under significant stress.\u201cAnti-Blackness may uniquely impact Black students, showing up in their experiences of being treated with fear and suspicion, policing and monitoring, interactions based on anti-intellectual stereotypes,\u201d she said.GBH\u2019s Basic Black: Mental Health & College StudentsNationally, the pandemic is driving down college enrollment. As a result, many predominantly white schools are relying more on high-performing students of color who may need more support, financially and otherwise.Carlota Ocampo, provost at Trinity Washington University in D.C., said colleges can\u2019t just enroll these students \u2014 they should provide mental health supports to help them succeed.\u201cWe must recognize that American society is constructed in such a way that people of color have experiences that are different and that may be traumatizing,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is not a problem of the person of color. That's a problem of society.\u201dDuring a pandemic and one of the most bitter elections in American history, Ocampo said college students of color have been facing unprecedented levels of stress and anxiety.\u201cIt's like we're living through the Spanish flu, the Great Depression, the riots of \u201868, all while Andrew Jackson is president,\u201d she said. \u201cThey're kind of like bothering everybody, so you can imagine all the more how these may be impacting people whose overall relationship to society just is fragile.\u201dOcampo is a national advisor to The Steve Fund, a nonprofit that advocates for mental health resources for underrepresented students. It recently made a series of recommendations to colleges, like revising the curriculum and widening the career pipeline.Chavous said it\u2019s also important to engage and promote professors who support students\u2019 mental health. \u201cWhen faculty are actually supported, incentivized and recognized for doing this work as important work, they\u2019re more likely to do it,\u201d she said.On Campus Radio: Stressed And Depressed On CampusAt Lesley, Mejia is on track to graduate this spring. He's trying to stay hopeful as he prepares to launch his career during a recession. But he said his pandemic depression is colliding with his seasonal depression.\u201cYou also have election stress and, even post-election, there\u2019s still going to be so much,\u201d he said before Nov. 3. Taking all of his classes online, Mejia can\u2019t see a therapist or even a professor face-to-face.\u201cI haven\u2019t even attempted to reach out because I'm not going to want to have a Zoom call to talk out my feelings with somebody,\u201d he said. \u201cUsually, what I need is to be in-person with somebody, and that's literally eliminated.\u201dFor now, Mejia is coping the best way he knows how: by writing poetry and taking photographs. When things get really bad, he sends a text to a suicide prevention hotline. GBH News' Diane Adame contributed to this report.If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255) or use the Crisis Text Line by texting \u201cHome\u201d to 741741.

        "body": "For the past year and a half, 20-year-old Jonathan Jutras, who has a developmental disability, has been held without bail at Middleton Jail, accused of indecently assaulting three boys at a playground in Beverly. While in custody, Jutras has come down with multiple illnesses, including COVID-19, and has reportedly been harassed by others in custody. Dutras' case is raising questions about how the state's criminal justice system handles those with disabilities. GBH All Things Considered host Arun Rath spoke with Salem News reporter Julie Manganis, who's been covering the case. This transcript has been edited for clarity.Arun Rath: Take us back to how all of this got started. What is Dutras accused of doing?Julie Manganis: He is accused of indecently assaulting three young boys, between the ages of 8 and 11, at a playground in Beverly. He is charged with basically trying to force the boys to pull their pants down, and then with inappropriately having contact with them. Rath: Jutras is an adult, he's 20 years old, but he has developmental disabilities that mean he does not function like a typical 20-year-old who does not have disabilities. Could you tell us in some more detail what he's dealing with and what that's meant for him and his family?Manganis: He has multiple diagnoses. He has a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, he is on the autism spectrum, and he has some physical limitations because he was born, I believe, three months premature. He has some lung issues and he functions at least emotionally at the same level as these boys, at about the 9- to 10-year-old level. He tends to want to associate with them. There may be other things going on, but he doesn't have an easy time dealing with people his own age, so that's been a problem. Now, of course, this is a much more serious situation that he's found himself in. Rath: Do we know why he would be put in jail with the general population as opposed to some other facility? Manganis: He was sent to a hospital for evaluation, but he doesn't necessarily meet the criteria for hospitalization at this point. But going back to the jail isn't a good fit for him, either. The problem is that there really aren't a lot of options in between, such as a supervised group home. That's what his lawyer was trying to find for him. Unfortunately, because of the conflict between his family and the attorney, there's been a lot of disagreement over which group home he would go to. There's also a lack of available places in these group homes. He needs a level of security beyond what most group homes will offer. The ones that are available are sometimes a distance away or they have other issues that impact the family, too.Rath: What's life like for him in jail? Manganis: I'm told that he has had a recurring skin infection. They haven't been able to really get a handle on it. He has had COVID-19, which is a concern because of his underlying lung condition. And because he's smaller and less mature, he tends to find himself being bullied and exploited by other, more savvy folks over there. So it hasn't been easy for him.Rath: Tell us more about the conflict between his parents and his lawyer that have resulted in the situation. Manganis: One of the problems is that his mother is very protective of him, and she heard that he was being considered for what's called a forensic group home. There are other people in that group home who have some serious criminal charges against them, but for one reason or another, either haven't been able to be tried or have been adjudicated and gotten some type of probation. She's concerned about him being in that facility and not being able to fend for himself there and not getting services. His lawyer said that really there are no perfect options, and even if it's not the ideal place for him, it's better than where he is now. So the lawyer was advocating for him to go to that group home. Unfortunately, as they were debating this, the spot was given to someone else. Rath: Even going beyond the reasons for him being in jail, a year and a half seems like a long time. That means that it goes back to before the pandemic. Why has it not been resolved? Manganis: Like a lot of cases, it's been basically put on hold. The other complication here is that he has been found to be not competent, so he can't participate in proceedings to resolve the case, which is another issue. He's kind of in this legal limbo, and the district attorney is concerned about public safety, so they don't want to necessarily drop the case. His lawyer can't really proceed in court without his ability to participate. Then COVID-19 came along and a lot of the proceedings ended up being delayed.Rath: In the course of your reporting, have you interviewed Jonathan Jutras?Manganis: I wasn't able to interview him directly. Part of the reason is because he's had various placements in the jail, and part of it is I think there's a concern on the part of his lawyer that he would potentially say something that could hurt his case. Based on reports from his family members, he's not doing well. Rath: You talked about the particulars of this case that have led to the situation. Also, we are in a pandemic which is unprecedented. But is this case, for those reasons, very much an outlier, or have you seen other situations like this in our criminal justice system? Manganis: I haven't seen other cases that are specifically like this one, but I have seen cases of people who are clearly in need of services that they can't receive at the jail, who have mental health issues or developmental issues, who are involved in the courts for one reason or another and can't get the services that they need. Rath: Do we have any sense of when there might be resolution? Is there any resolution in sight for this case of Jonathan Jutras?Manganis: For this case, I don't think the criminal case is going anywhere at this point, for now, but there is a possible placement for him. According to his mother, there may be an opening at a program in January that would be more appropriate for him. So she's on board with that. There have also been some developments in terms of her role in the case, so there may be some progress now because the case is now starting to get a little bit of attention in court. The judges and court staff are looking at it and saying, This case is a year and a half old. What are we doing with it? ",

        "body": "President Trump makes five stops in five different swing states Sunday, while his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, focuses on Pennsylvania just days before Election Day.Trump began his Sunday speaking to supporters in Macomb County, Mich. \u2014 a state he captured by just about 10,000 votes in 2016, but where Biden currently leads in polls \u2014 to make a last-ditch appeal to voters as to why he deserves to be reelected. In his characteristically boastful tone, Trump defended his administration's handling of the coronavirus and touted the nation's economic success prior to the pandemic. \"This election is a choice between the Biden depression,\" Trump said, \"or you can have the greatest economic boom in the history of our country.\"\"The Biden plan is to imprison you in your home,\" Trump added. His administration has pushed to get people back to work and kids to school with few restrictions, even as the coronavirus has continued to savage the country. Trump's jam-packed campaign schedule ahead of the end of voting on Tuesday highlights the uphill battle he faces to reelection and the categorically dissimilar style to campaigning he has taken in contrast to Biden. With 230,000 Americans now dead from the coronavirus, Trump has repeatedly denied responsibility for the virus' toll, and he continues to hold large, close-contact campaign events in outdoor spaces. \"Look at what China has done to the world. And we're not forgetting it,\" Trump said Sunday in Michigan, in reference to the coronavirus, which first appeared in China. Researchers at Stanford University have found that Trump's rallies this summer were likely responsible for some 30,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus. Researchers say that these events likely resulted in more than 700 deaths. Biden, on the other hand, has made underscoring the human cost of the pandemic his key pitch to voters while spotlighting what he calls an irresponsible and anti-science handling of the virus by Trump and his administration. In keeping with public health guidelines, Biden has held fewer, smaller campaign events \u2014 often with supporters remaining in or around their cars for a drive-in \u2014  while accusing Trump of orchestrating \"super-spreader\" rallies. Biden holds two events Sunday in Philadelphia, and then travels to Cleveland Monday before returning to Pennsylvania to barnstorm the state. Trump himself held four rallies in Pennsylvania on Saturday. It's another swing state that Trump carried in 2016 but where the president now trails in surveys.With the election just days away, Biden has also enlisted the help of Democratic favorite Barack Obama, the former president. He appeared with Biden in Michigan on Saturday, and travels to Georgia and Florida on Monday. Trump has planned five rallies in four key states on Monday, ending in Michigan.One Biden campaign event in Texas had to be cancelled over the weekend, after a caravan of Trump supporters swarmed a Biden campaign bus and forced it to stop. Trump seemed to praise his supporters' actions in a tweet, proclaiming \"I LOVE TEXAS!\" alongside what appeared to be a video of the incident.  Copyright 2020 NPR.

        "body": "I\u2019m proud of my lifetime of voting, exercising my most important civic duty \u2014 a lifetime duty that has its roots in the many times I went to the polls before I could vote.My election season tradition began as a kid accompanying my parents as they cast their ballots. Both working people, they would go during the last hours \u2014 a deliberate move, I realized years later, to make sure they\u2019d meet up with most of our neighbors, who also went to the polls at the end of the work day. It was a festive atmosphere, with my parents laughing and catching up on local gossip while showing off my sister and me as the well-behaved children that we were. I recall waiting in line, and how exciting and satisfying it was to go behind the curtain and watch my parents pull the levers on those old-fashioned machines.From those early experiences, voting was a habit ingrained in me. As soon as I was eligible to vote, I did so faithfully, with pride. On the one occasion when I was forced to get an absentee ballot, I felt cheated out of an experience I\u2019d come to treasure. Through the years and the many elections, I\u2019ve been every kind of emotional voter. The excited voter, the anxious voter, the contemplative voter. But this year, I took on a new persona: the rage voter.Maybe you won\u2019t be surprised to learn that in the never-ending pathology that is 2020, there are a lot of us rage voters. So many that pollsters and political analysts have taken notice.Rage voters include a broad swath of voters \u2014 a non-partisan, cross-generational, group of men, women and nonbinary citizens who are angry for various reasons. Yes, there have always been voters motivated by anger, but this year\u2019s angry voters have transcended simple anger to rage, expressing a roiling combination of focused determination and passion. A recent New York Times report examined the rage trend, zeroing in on women declaring themselves rage voters. Women, overwhelmed by their COVID-19-forced multiple roles, the Times described as \u201cteacher caregiver, employee and parent.\u201d Alida Garcia, vice president of the immigration advocacy group Fwd.us, told Times reporters \u201cI am so full of rage. We are exhausted.\u201d Both the campaigns of President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden hope to capture the rage vote, with Biden so far, statistically, ahead in the battle.Fueled by my rage, I headed to my nearby early voting location on the first day before the doors opened. I was the 75th person in line (I counted), which quickly grew longer behind me. It was clear that everybody in line had been there a while. They were \u2014 standing in the steady rain during an unusually cold morning \u2014 what New Englanders called raw. But they did not budge, not even to run to the car for a quick warmup. And for the most part, nobody talked. I didn\u2019t ask them if they were rage voters, but I know it takes a powerful motivator to get people to stand still in rainy, raw weather.Voting is important to me; I don\u2019t want rage to be any part of my motivation ever again. That\u2019s even though I know it spurred the record-breaking millions of Americans who\u2019ve already voted well before tomorrow\u2019s official Election Day. In these politically divisive times, I observe that there is one thing about which we voters all seem to be saying: \u201cThis is the most important election of my life.\u201d",

        "body": "President Trump is celebrating a caravan of supporters who followed a Biden-Harris campaign bus in Central Texas. In a Saturday night tweet, the president retweeted a video showing his supporters surrounding the bus, set to Tech N9ne's \"Red Kingdom.\" \"I LOVE TEXAS!\" Trump said.The tweet came after a separate video surfaced showing vehicles with Trump 2020 flags boxing in the blue campaign bus as it traveled Interstate 35 from San Antonio to Austin. In a statement, the Biden campaign said the cars slowed in front of it in an attempt to \"stop the bus in the middle of the highway,\" the Washington Post reported.  The Friday incident rattled the Biden campaign, which canceled at least one event in the state following the episode. Campaign staff called 911, according to the statement, and was given help by law enforcement reaching its destination.Neither Joe Biden, who had been campaigning in the Midwest, nor his running mate Kamala Harris, campaigning elsewhere in Texas, were on the bus at the time.Trump discussed the caravan at a Michigan campaign event on Sunday. \"Did you see the way our people, they were, ya know, protecting this bus ... because they're nice,\" he said. \"They had hundreds of cars. Trump! Trump! Trump and the American flag.\" Trump favorably contrasted his supporters with Biden supporters, who he said lack spirit and enthusiasm. \"The Trump Train is in hot pursuit,\" wrote one of the participants of the caravan on Twitter, where they posted several updates of the location of the Biden bus throughout the day. \"Just a few of our great patriots out there.\" In another video of the incident posted to social media, a truck in the caravan clips a white car. \"Rather than engage in productive conversation about the drastically different visions that Joe Biden and Donald Trump have for our country, Trump supporters in Texas today instead decided to put our staff, surrogates, supporters, and others in harm's way,\" the Biden campaign's Texas communications director, Tariq Thowfeek, said in a statement, the Post reported.The Friday incident comes amid a particularly heated contest in Texas, where polls show Biden in striking distance of winning a state that no Democratic nominee has won since 1976. Tensions have been running high in the final days leading up to Election Day, as voters on both sides fear violence from the opposition, and the president's words have raised concern over potential voter intimidation.Katie Naranjo, chair of the Travis County Democratic Party, said the caravan was a clear attempt by Trump's base to intimidate Biden supporters. \"They ran into a person's car, yelling curse words and threats,\" Naranjo said. \"Don't let bullies win, vote.\"\"We just canceled a joint event in Pfulgerville\" with the Biden campaign \"due to security reasons,\" Austin City Councilwoman Sheryl Cole said on Twitter. \"Unfortunately, Pro-Trump Protestors have escalated well beyond safe limits.\"Republicans have pushed back on allegations of voter intimidation. \"It is more fake news and propaganda,\" Texas GOP Chairman Allen West said in a statement. \"Prepare to lose,\" he said, adding: \"stop bothering me.\"  Copyright 2020 NPR.

        "body": "The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted countless aspects of everyday life for months now, and the 2020 election is no exception. States across the country, including Massachusetts, have responded by greatly expanding early voting and mail-in voting options for voters. For their part, voters have responded, with more than 92 million Americans having already cast their ballot, according to the U.S. Election Project. Here in Massachusetts, between mail-in and early voting, nearly half of registered voters have already voted. ModuleBut this unprecedented interest in voting before Election Day has also injected unprecedented uncertainty into what Election Day will look like.Many of these states have never dealt with mail-in voting anywhere near the scale they are seeing in 2020. And in many cases, expanding early and mail-in voting options meant states had to pass new elections laws. Everyone from pundits to elections experts to elected officials have said that the upshot is that it could be days, or even weeks, until we know who won the election. Why it could take a few days At the end of the day, voting is a process \u2014 and it takes time for votes to be cast, counted, and reported, even in normal times. \u201cAs anyone who\u2019s ever voted knows, if you go to vote, most of the poll workers are senior citizens.\u201d said John Lappie, professor of political science at Plymouth State University in New Hampshire. But Lappie said concerns about COVID among this high-risk group has meant many experienced poll workers have chosen to sit this cycle out. \u201cSo a lot of polling places are going to be understaffed,\u201d he said, noting his own town of Plymouth, N.H., has appealed to local college students to become first-time poll workers this year in order to fill vacant positions.Lappie said the lack of staff and experience at polling locations throughout the country means that routine activities may take longer at a lot of polling places.But the true timeline wildcard is the dramatic increase in the number of mail-in ballots that states across the country will be handling this year.Counting mail-in ballots involves several steps, many of them that have to be done by hand, such as opening envelopes, verifying signatures, sorting ballots by precinct, and feeding validated ballots into voting machines to be counted. \u201cAll of those things take a lot more time to do than counting Election Day returns, especially when you\u2019re understaffed,\u201d said Lappie.Many states will be handling mail-in ballots at numbers never before seen this year, adding to uncertainty about the timeline. And elections, even for president, are run at the state level \u2014 meaning each state does things a little differently.In some states, like Arizona, Florida and North Carolina, elections officials have been processing mail-in ballots for weeks \u2014 opening envelopes, verifying signatures, sorting ballots \u2014 meaning they could be able to report results as early as Election Day.But in other states, including Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, mail-in ballots cannot begin to be processed until Election Day.\u201cIn those states, it could be seriously delayed,\u201d said Lappie. Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers told CNN on Sunday, \u201cPeople need to relax, and it may take a day or so longer than it usually does.\u201dPennsylvania Secretary of the Commonwealth Kathy Boockvar has said that she expects \u201cthe overwhelming majority\u201d of votes will be counted by Friday, Nov. 6.Furthermore, the way in which state will reports results also varies. In Massachusetts, for example, results are released as they are determined following the close of the polls. And those results will include a mix of early, mail-in, and in-person votes. In neighboring Rhode Island, however, in-person votes will be released first. A first count of mail-in votes will not be released until 11 p.m. on election night. This matters because of the expectation that supporters of each presidential candidate also have a preference when it comes to how they vote this year.\u201cThe Election Day vote will be heavily Republican, the vote-by-mail will be heavily Democrat,\u201d said Lappie. As such, Lappie says it\u2019s important to pay attention to the specifics as to which votes are being reported as election night wears on. \u201cIn Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, if \u2014 as would normally be the case \u2014 the Election Day results are tabulated first and then released to the public \u2026 you could have early election results that look very good for the president that \u2018turn into a victory\u2019 for Joe Biden as the mail-in ballots get counted,\u201d he said. In states like North Carolina and Florida, he said the opposite could be true.\u201cThe early returns there could be very favorable for Biden and then narrow as the Election Day results get released,\u201d he said.Why it could take a few weeks In a word: Litigation. An analysis by USA Today found that 230 election-related federal lawsuits were filed from Jan. 1 to Oct. 23, higher than any of the past three presidential election years during the same time period.Some of these cases have been resolved. Some have not. Others could be appealed. And new challenges are expected to be brought in the courts following Nov. 3. Many of these lawsuits concern small details, like the specifics of deadlines or under what specific conditions a mail-in ballot should be rejected. But in a close election, especially in crucial swing states, decisions about these small details could make a big difference. Take Pennsylvania, a state seen as critical to both candidates, as an example.One of the tools elections officials use to verify a voter\u2019s identity with mail-in ballots is signature verification. A number of states, including Massachusetts, match each voter\u2019s signature on their mail-in ballot envelope against some other copy of their signature on record to ensure it is indeed the same person.In Pennsylvania, the Secretary of State said that signatures on a ballot are required, but don\u2019t need to be matched against another signature in order to be valid. In late October, the Pennsylvania State Supreme Court agreed, ruling that \u201ccounty boards of elections are prohibited from rejecting absentee or mail-in ballots based on signature comparison conducted by county election officials or employees, or as the result of third-party challenges based on signature analysis and comparisons.\u201dFor now, that means ballots in Pennsylvania will not be rejected if there is a signature discrepancy. But that ruling could be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court following the election. Also in question in Pennsylvania is the status of ballots that are postmarked by Election Day and arrive after the polls close on election night but before 5 p.m. on Nov. 6. The Pennsylvania State Supreme Court has ruled those ballots should be counted, as state election laws allows. A 4-4 deadlock on the issue in the U.S. Supreme Court in October kept that ruling in place. So, as of now, they will count. But the state will separate those ballots as their validity could yet be overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court after the election, now that Justice Amy Coney Barrett has been sworn in and could theoretically break a tie. And that\u2019s just one state. In Minnesota, they will also separate ballots postmarked by Election Day and received until Nov. 10. Whether those votes will ultimately count is still in question. In Nevada, Republicans are asking that mail-in votes in Clark County stop being counted until observers are given an opportunity to see exactly how ballot-envelope signatures are being verified. If any of these groups of ballots in one or more of these states could determine the winner, you can expect to see battles in the courts over whether they should count.That could drag the results out for weeks.How many weeks? Circle Dec. 14 on your calendar. That is the date by which, according to federal election law, the Electoral College \u2014 the group of electors who technically elect the president and vice president \u2014 must cast their votes. \u201cThere is a hard deadline,\u201d said Lappie. \u201cAll of these things need to be resolved between Nov. 3 and Dec. 14.\u201dWhy we could know on Election Night Florida and North Carolina, two key swing states, are among those where mail-in ballots have been getting processed for weeks already. That should put both states in a strong position to report reliable results on election night that include both mail-in and in-person, Election Day votes.Depending on how close the vote is, either or both of these states could be \u201ccalled\u201d for one candidate or the other on election night, just like might happen in a more typical election year. Lackie said that a clear Biden victory in either of those two states would essentially secure a Biden win, \u201cbecause President Trump does not have a plausible path to a majority that doesn\u2019t include both North Carolina and Florida.\u201d Lackie says a Trump victory in these two states would be promising for the president, but would not be as definitive a result, as Biden has a viable path to victory that does not include him winning either Florida or North Carolina. Polls show a close race in both states.",

        "body": "On Sunday and Monday, families across Mexico, the U.S. and elsewhere are observing D\u00eda de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead, a Mexican holiday that celebrates the lives and honors the memory of those who've passed on.And each year, the National Museum of Mexican Art in Chicago has a special exhibition for the holiday.But the coronavirus pandemic has made the usual programming impossible. This year, the museum is going virtual, with a Day of the Dead exhibition that pays tribute to the people in Mexico, the U.S. and around the world who have died of COVID-19.\"It was really important that we still put on this exhibition,\" says Ces\u00e1reo Moreno, the museum's chief curator and visual arts director. \"Like so many other rituals in our lives, they're more than just a marker of time or season. They give us a sense of the normal. They give us an idea of where we're at.\"An electronic counter, updated each day, displays the number of people who have died of COVID-19. In the past, the museum has honored people who died in hurricanes and earthquakes, or those who died in the desert while attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border.But memorializing an ongoing tragedy is more difficult than an event that has come and gone, Moreno tells NPR's Michel Martin on All Things Considered.\"Right now, we don't see the end. It's still going. And so it's difficult to really try to commemorate something that you are still in the middle of. So the best way we could think of symbolizing that is with the numbers.\"This is the 34th year that the museum has commemorated D\u00eda de los Muertos, also called D\u00eda de Muertos. But the roots of the holiday itself go back centuries.\"It's a combination of two spiritual belief systems,\" Moreno says. \"It's the ancient indigenous cosmology and the Spanish Catholicism that was brought over with the arrival of the Europeans. And so it's combined together to form a very unique tradition and understanding and rituals that deal with the idea of life after death. And, of course, remembrance of those people here on Earth.\"In Mexico, D\u00eda de los Muertos can be celebrated by entire communities gathering together at cemeteries to clean and decorate graves of loved ones. There is singing, crying, drinking, eating and playing overnight until the sun rises, when people clean up and go home.At home, people can build altars and put out ofrendas, or offerings, for those who have passed on.\"We remember them by remembering what they enjoyed while they were here on Earth,\" Moreno says. \"So if somebody had a specific food that they liked, you would place that out on the altar as an ofrenda. You also put their photographs out, you share stories about them, and it really becomes a time to memorialize these individuals. It's really important that we keep saying their names, we keep telling their stories, and we pass these ideas on to the next generation.\"This year, though, like so many other celebrations, the coronavirus pandemic has thwarted the way D\u00eda de los Muertos can be celebrated. The pandemic has had an outsize impact on Latinx people in the United States, who are hospitalized from COVID-19 at four times the rate of white Americans.Moreno says that despite the show being entirely virtual, the tours are from all over the country, which feels, in a way, that they've \"reached a little bit further.\"\"It's not as beautiful as having children walk through the museum galleries and hearing their reactions,\" he says. \"But certainly it is at the heart of it, at the core of it, it is providing this idea of life and death and just sort of a celebration of life. It's a way of understanding death as a part of life. It's not the opposite. It's just part of the same thing.\"  Copyright 2020 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

        "body": "President Trump is doubling down on claims that the results of the presidential election must be known on election night itself, falsely asserting, \"that's the way it's been and that's the way it should be.\" Speaking to reporters after arriving in North Carolina on Sunday evening during a campaign swing, Trump repeatedly called a recent Supreme Court decision on absentee ballots \"terrible.\" The decision allows election officials in Pennsylvania to count absentee ballots received as late as Friday, as long as they are postmarked by Nov. 3. The president denied that he would try to declare victory prematurely. But then he still raised doubts about counting votes beyond Election Day, even though in any election, it typically takes longer to count absentee ballots that by law count just the same as votes cast in person. More of those ballots are being cast this year because of the pandemic. \"I think it's a terrible thing when people or states are allowed to tabulate ballots for a long period of time after the election is over,\" Trump said. \"I think it's terrible when we can't know the results of an election the night of the election in a modern-day age of computers,\" he added.Trump also suggested that voters should have mailed in their ballots well before the deadlines set by states, saying, \"If people wanted to get their ballots in, they should have gotten their ballots in long before [Election Day]. They could have put their ballots in a month ago.\"  Trump has repeatedly made unfounded claims about the integrity of absentee voting and even told supporters on Sunday to \"be careful\" with mail-in ballots.This isn't the first time Trump has said the winner of the contest should be known on Nov. 3. Earlier on Sunday, during a campaign stop in Dubuque, Iowa, Trump bemoaned the idea of having to wait for results. \"We should know the result of the election on November 3rd, the evening of November 3rd. That's the way it's been and that's the way it should be,\" he said to cheers, repeating a sentiment he tweeted out on Friday. Trump's campaign senior adviser Jason Miller reiterated the argument Sunday on ABC's This Week, adding an unfounded accusation that Democrats would do something nefarious.\"If you speak with many smart Democrats, they believe President Trump will be ahead on election night, probably getting 280 electorals, somewhere in that range, and then they're going to try to steal it back after the election,\" Miller said. But that's not the way voting in America works. For starters, no state ever reports its final results on Election Night.Typically, news outlets are able to declare winners the night of the election using partial counts and exit polls, which allow them to see how much of the vote is going to which candidate and calculate whether a candidate still has a path forward to win. Each state has its own laws for when it needs to certify the election's results and none fall on Election Day itself. Delaware, in fact, is the only state that will certify its results within the same week as Election Day. Most states will certify their results in the last two weeks of November, with some states even extending until the second week of December. Additionally, polls don't even close in California, Oregon, Idaho and Washington until 11 p.m. ET, and Hawaii's polls don't close until midnight on the east coast. As NPR's Domenico Montanaro notes, the Associated Press didn't call the 2016 presidential race until 2:30a.m. the day after Election Day, and at that time, Trump was still leading in the popular vote. Hillary Clinton went on to win the popular vote by about 3 million. Another factor to consider in the counting calculus is the surge in early voting. Americans are breaking early voting records, with more than 93 million votes already cast. Of that, 59 million mail-in ballots have been returned, with 32 million ballots still waiting to be mailed back, according to the U.S. Elections Project. Election experts predicted that there would be a large increase in mail-in ballots this cycle because of concerns over the coronavirus pandemic. The increase in these absentee ballots may mean the count will take longer, particularly because election workers typically need to process each ballot by hand. While some states, including Florida and Arizona, are able to begin processing mail-in ballots well ahead of Nov. 3, many states don't allow for that, which results in a slowing of the vote count. Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar told NBC's Meet the Press that she anticipates the count will go well beyond Tuesday. \"I expect that the overwhelming majority of ballots in Pennsylvania, that's mail-in and absentee ballots, as well as in-person ballots, will be counted within a matter of days,\" Boockvar said. \"The counties are staffing up, have a ton of equipment, best practices in place, and are planning, for the most part, to count 24/7 until it's done.\"  Copyright 2020 NPR.

        "body": "It was either put food on the table or drop their health insurance, says Oscar Anchia of Miami. His wife's coverage was costing $700 a month, and his hours had been cut back because of the coronavirus pandemic. So Anchia made the difficult decision to drop his spouse from his policy, because they needed the money.Then in October, his love for 40 years fell ill with COVID-19.\"This has been a crazy, crazy nightmare,\" he said, after his wife's first week in the hospital. He kept asking Baptist Health about the bill. He was already at $92,000 from her stay in the intensive care unit.At this point, Anchia's best hope is that his wife will be covered by a federal assistance program for uninsured COVID-19 patients. But that's because he lives in one of the dozen holdout states that hasn't expanded Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act. That part of the ACA was intended to provide health coverage for adults who are working but who have no insurance through their job \u2014 either because it's not offered or because they can't afford the premiums.Medicaid provides health care for millions of low-income Americans. But its future depends very much on politics. Over the past four years, the Trump administration has tried to impose conservative principles on the program and shrink it. A Joe Biden presidency would attempt to go the other way.\"For example, me, I always work. I've been working 36 years in the same company,\" says Anchia, who builds signage for airports. \"And now I find myself in this position. Medicaid would be great for regular people. I'm not the only one.\"Anchia's wife is out of the ICU, but he also expects he'll need help paying for prescription medication when she's sent home.In Florida alone, roughly 1.5 million people would be eligible for coverage under Medicaid expansion, according to estimates by the Florida Health Justice Project. It's a number that has grown recently because of the economic trouble and job losses triggered by the pandemic.\"The pandemic has really elevated the visibility of the suffering and that it cuts across socioeconomic lines,\" says Miriam Harmatz, executive director of the Florida Health Justice Project. \"These are folks you wouldn't have expected to be among the ranks of the uninsured.\"Under a Biden administration, Democrats could deliver on a proposal known as \"the public option.\" It would bring coverage to people in this uninsured group without requiring them to wait for state officials to take action on Medicaid.But Harmatz is hopeful that Florida could still join the ranks of expansion states, no matter who becomes president.Even under the Trump administration, some Republican-led states have moved forward with Medicaid expansion after initially refusing. New survey data from the Commonwealth Fund find that expansion remains popular with voters, even among Republicans, in 10 swing states that may decide the outcome of this election.This summer, voters in Oklahoma and Missouri approved ballot measures to expand Medicaid, against the wishes of their Republican governors and legislators.Most recently, Georgia's request to expand Medicaid was approved this month by Trump appointees at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Georgia's expansion, however, will apply to fewer adults than in other states, allow the state to charge some monthly premiums and require adults to work or engage in other \"qualifying activities.\"Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp hailed the limited expansion of Medicaid as a way to save money. Critics point out, however, that the Kemp plan means Georgia actually receives less federal aid to cover these new Medicaid enrollees, compared with states that embraced a full Medicaid expansion, and that tens of thousands of Georgians will still remain uninsured, which can put financial stresses on hospitals and local taxpayers.In the last four years, Trump's health officials have pushed states to look for ways to spend less on Medicaid.\"I think the Trump administration views Medicaid the same way every Republican administration does, as sort of a nuisance,\" says Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute.Making work requirements part of eligibility has been the most popular way to try to rein in spending and push back against Medicaid expansion.But work requirements have been blocked by the courts.\"I don't really see a lot of enthusiasm for work requirements returning,\" Cannon says. \"But I don't really see a lot of enthusiasm by Republicans to work on any broader Medicaid reforms, either.\"The more sweeping Republican-backed initiative \u2014 which has been somewhat sidetracked by the pandemic \u2014 calls on states to overhaul how Medicaid is paid for. Currently, each state splits the costs of Medicaid with the federal government, with the feds paying 50% to 75% of each enrollee's cost, depending on the state. The new payment idea, called a \"block grant,\" would involve the federal government giving each state a yearly lump sum payment for Medicaid and would essentially cap the federal government's responsibility. Block grants have been an ambition of the Republican Party for decades.Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, paved the way for block grants in January. Tennessee was first in line. But the state is still the only one waiting to hear back on its request.That's partly because Tennessee is asking for a block grant that would bring the state more federal money for Medicaid, not less \u2014 as much as a billion dollars a year.\"Folks here in Tennessee found a creative way to propose a block grant that, at least from a financial standpoint, didn't pose really any risk for the state,\" says Mandy Pellegrin, policy director of the Tennessee-based Sycamore Institute.If the federal government approves the design of the proposed block grant, Tennessee could theoretically use the additional money to add more residents to its Medicaid rolls. \"Expansion is certainly something that could happen under this waiver,\" Pellegrin says.Even though Tennessee's specific proposal has the potential to cover many more people, Democrats have generally dismissed the idea of block grants as a backdoor way to cut benefits Americans are entitled to.This policy push-and-pull over Medicaid assumes that the Affordable Care Act will stay intact, including the 90% federal matching money that most states have relied on to expand coverage to the working poor. But the Trump administration is still pushing for the Supreme Court to overturn the entire law, with an oral argument set for Nov. 10.\"We would not expect that to continue under a Biden administration,\" says Rachel Nuzum, vice president of federal and state health policy at the Commonwealth Fund. \"So there's a fair bit of uncertainty. What we know is, states cannot operate well in an environment of uncertainty.\"Nuzum says this election \u2014 from state legislative contests up to the White House \u2014 has the potential to provide a little more certainty on how millions of Americans receive their health care.This story was produced in partnership with Kaiser Health News and Nashville Public Radio.

One thing is clear: Whoever wins could shape what America means for generations to come through social policy, the courts and by their own example.Voters are turning outThis election is expected to have the highest voter turnout since 1908, north of 65% of eligible voters turning out, according to Michael McDonald, a turnout expert at the University of Florida who runs the U.S. Elections Project.It's on track for that and possibly more, considering the sky-high early voting totals. So far, more than 93.1 million people have voted early. That's about 68% of the total votes in 2016.In some key contested states, the totals are even higher than that. Take Texas, for example, where more people have cast a ballot already than in the entire 2016 election. More Texans have now voted in the 2020 presidential election than in any election ever by about 700,000 and climbing, as of Sunday afternoon.There's a similar trend across the country \u2014 North Carolina has hit 95% of its 2016 total, Georgia 94%, Florida 91%, Nevada 91%, Arizona 87%, according to the Elections Project.A referendum on TrumpThese numbers are all about President Trump. He has inspired deep devotion and intense repulsion, and that is translating to sky-high enthusiasm for voting \u2014 whether that's in person or by mail because of the coronavirus pandemic.As is the case with most presidential reelection campaigns, this has been a referendum on the president's first term. Trump touts what was a strong economy before COVID-19 shocked the country, his tax cuts and trade deals, as well as reshaping the Supreme Court in a conservative direction.Democrats \u2014 and many independents, according to the polls \u2014 see a president who takes pride in not playing by the rules, has inflamed racial division, is untruthful, mishandled a pandemic, damaged the country's image around the world and is an existential threat to progress and justice.As one candidate in this race might say, and that's not hyperbole, folks.\"You're the worst president America has ever had,\" Democratic nominee Joe Biden, a former vice president, told Trump during their first presidential debate.The president's counterpunchTrump, for his part, has tried to deflect the focus from himself onto Biden. Trump and his campaign have recognized that they needed to try and make Biden so unacceptable that those wavering 2016 Trump voters will stick with the president.They have warned that Trump is the only thing standing between America and\"socialism,\" claiming Biden is too inept to prevent being taken over by a radical left that wants to defund the police and bring crime to the suburbs.\"No one will be safe in Joe Biden's America,\" Trump said this summer. \"I can't even call it Biden's America \u2014 the guy doesn't even know he's alive.\"It's something he's repeated many times, even claiming Biden \"doesn't know where he is\" or \"what office he's running for.\"So far, surveys have shown that attack hasn't stuck. Biden has maintained a wide lead in an average of the polls and consistent, if smaller, leads in many of the states key to the Electoral College, which determines who will be president.Voters have also said consistently that Biden would be better to handle the coronavirus, race relations and even crime, despite Trump casting himself as the pro-police \"law and order\" candidate. Trump continues to get a slight edge on the economy.Voting groups to watchTrump has done little to reach out beyond his base, who still strongly support him. The Trump campaign's theory of the case is that there are more untapped eligible voters out there who were open to Trump's message in 2016, but didn't turn out at the polls.One of Trump's strongest core groups are white voters without a college degree. And it's true that there is room to grow with them. Trump won a record margin with the group in 2016, but they turned out at a 58% rate that year, lower than in some recent past presidential elections.This group is worth watching, but the negative environment for Trump's presidency and the absence of Hillary Clinton on the ballot (Biden is better liked) casts doubt on its motivations for voting this time. Especially if these voters didn't turn out in 2016 when Trump was fresh and new as a candidate.What's more, 2016 wasn't just a base election. Trump won persuadable voters. He won voters who decided in the last month as well as a big share of those who said they didn't like him or Clinton, according to exit polls.Trump also won independents, suburban voters and seniors in that election, too. And those groups are telling pollsters this year that they have largely abandoned him. He really can't afford to lose any voters, considering he won by fewer than 80,000 votes in the three key states that put him over the top \u2014 Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.The pathAll that said, Trump remains within striking distance in the key swing states. The Trump campaign had hoped Trump's chances would get better if there was news of a potential vaccine for the coronavirus on the horizon or COVID-19 cases declining in the country. But neither has been true. For Trump to win, there would have to be an even bigger polling error than in 2016. He would have to win every toss up state and one leaning in Biden's direction currently. That's possible, given the toss-up states are all polling within the margin of error and they certainly could all break in one direction.But bigger than what the keys are to this election, the outcome will likely have consequences for how politics is practiced and how Americans conduct themselves for generations to come.

        "body": "OPA-LOCKA, Fla. (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump is suggesting that he will fire Dr. Anthony Fauci after Tuesday\u2019s election, as his rift with the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert widens while the nation sees its most alarming outbreak of the coronavirus since the spring.Speaking at a campaign rally in Opa-locka, Florida, Trump expressed frustration that the surging cases of the virus that has killed more than 231,000 people in the United States this year remains prominent in the news, sparking chants of \u201cFire Fauci\u201d from his supporters.\u201cDon\u2019t tell anybody but let me wait until a little bit after the election,\u201d Trump replied to thousands of supporters early Monday, adding he appreciated their \u201cadvice.\u201dTrump\u2019s comments on Fauci less than 48 hours before polls close all but assure that his handling of the pandemic will remain front and center heading into Election Day.It\u2019s the most direct Trump has been in suggesting he was serious about trying to remove Fauci from his position. He has previously expressed that he was concerned about the political blowback of removing the popular and respected doctor before Election Day.Trump\u2019s comments come after Fauci leveled his sharpest criticism yet of the White House\u2019s response to the coronavirus and Trump\u2019s public assertion that the nation is \u201crounding the turn\u201d on the virus.Fauci has grown outspoken that Trump has ignored his advice for containing the virus, saying he hasn\u2019t spoken with Trump in more than a month. He has raised alarm that the nation was heading for a challenging winter if more isn\u2019t done soon to slow the spread of the disease.In an interview with The Washington Post this weekend, Fauci cautioned that the U.S. will have to deal with \u201ca whole lot of hurt\u201d in the weeks ahead due to surging coronavirus cases.Fauci said the U.S. \u201ccould not possibly be positioned more poorly\u201d to stem rising cases as more people gather indoors during the colder fall and winter months. He says the U.S. will need to make an \u201cabrupt change\u201d in public health precautions.Fauci added that he believed Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden \u201cis taking it seriously from a public health perspective,\u201d while Trump is \u201clooking at it from a different perspective.\u201d Fauci, who\u2019s on the White House coronavirus task force, said that perspective emphasizes \u201cthe economy and reopening the country.\u201dIn response, White House spokesman Judd Deere said Trump always puts people\u2019s well-being first and Deere charges that Fauci has decided \u201cto play politics\u201d right before Tuesday\u2019s election. Deere said Fauci \u201chas a duty to express concerns or push for a change in strategy\u201d but instead is \u201cchoosing to criticize the president in the media and make his political leanings known.\u201dTrump in recent days has stepped up his attacks on Biden for pledging to heed the advice of scientists in responding to the pandemic. Trump has claimed Biden would \u201clock down\u201d the nation once again. Biden has promised to heed the warnings of Fauci and other medical professionals but has not endorsed another national lockdown.Trump has recently relied on the advice of Stanford doctor Scott Atlas, who has no prior background in infectious diseases or public health, as his lead science adviser on the pandemic. Atlas has been a public skeptic about mask wearing and other measures widely accepted by the scientific community to slow the spread of the virus.Other members of the White House coronavirus task force have grown increasingly vocal about what they see as a dangerous fall spike in the virus.Trump's aggressive approach to Fauci carries some risks this close to Election Day,A Kaiser Family Foundation poll in September showed 68% of Americans have a great deal or a fair amount of trust in Fauci to provide reliable information on the coronavirus. That compares with 52% of Americans who trusted Biden to do that and just 40% for Trump.",

        "body": "The 2020 presidential race between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden is coming to a close tomorrow, but a new chapter in political history is about to be written. Millions of voters have already cast their ballots, with record numbers voting early and by mail, and in some states there is a possibility of legal challenges following Election Day. That means an Election Day, night, and week like no other. Adam Reilly and Peter Kadzis, co-hosts of \u201cThe Scrum\u201d podcast, joined Joe Mathieu on \u201cMorning Edition\u201d today to discuss what we can expect over the next 48 hours and beyond. As political analysts who have covered the presidential race for months, Kadzis and Reilly understand why Americans feel anxious heading into election week. \u201cI can\u2019t remember a time in my life that there were two such disparate visions for the country,\u201d Reilly said. \u201cWe have absolutely no idea what\u2019s going to happen, starting Tuesday and extending into January.\u201d Adding to the uncertainty, many voters felt misled by the polls in the 2016 presidential election, which had predicted a victory for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Four years later, many polls indicate a sizable Biden lead \u2014 but can we believe them this time? \u201cI generally believe the polls, but polls are merely a prediction of where things stand in a moment in time,\u201d Kadzis said. He said it\u2019s likely we won\u2019t have results Tuesday evening. \u201cBut I think we\u2019re going to know sooner rather than later.\u201dIn the 2000 presidential election, it took five weeks to determine a winner because of legal challenges, but Kadsiz anticipates that we will know the results much sooner this time, even if it is prolonged by irregularities. \u201cIt may take five weeks to nail the decision down,\" he said. \"I think the decision will be fairly apparent within a few days.\"To ease anxiety, Kadzis encouraged voters to watch for two indicators close to home, starting with Worcester County, where Republicans are gaining ground. \u201cIn Central Massachusetts, we have an example of the urban-rural divide that\u2019s representative of Biden and Trump.\u201d Then, look North to New Hampshire, where Kadzis says Biden is up by double digits. \u201cIf we look in our own backyard, we\u2019ll get a little peek as to how things might go.\u201dWatch: Kadzis And Reilly On Their Differing Levels Of Election Day AnxietyRaw Html",

        "body": "Missing a national election is \u2014 for me \u2014 the equivilant of skipping a superbowl.That's why I assume you\u2019ll be glued to your TV, laptop, and phone. With that in mind, I have assembled a guide to help you make sense of what\u2019s happening, and to read the signals and tea leaves along with the talking heads and online pundits. Because of COVID, this year's election is unlike any in recent memory. So, to establish some sort of recognizable frame of reference, I\u2019ve used as guideposts the times when developments took place on election night\u2014 and beyond\u2014in 2016 and 2018. All are listed in Eastern Standard Time. Use this information to set your expectations as you follow the returns. Tuesday 3:19 pm 2018: ABC News reported that White House sources expected Democrats to win control of the House. Media figures have gotten pretty good about concealing or downplaying what they have seen from exit polls and other sources. The odds are worse, however, that Trump and his leak-steady political teammates can keep their poker faces. They might give background quotes to media sources, as they did two years ago, or just tweet things out. Watch for tells beginning at around 3:00.  6:59pm 2016: The Associated Press (AP) called Indiana and Kentucky for Trump and the Kentucky Senate for Rand Paul. Kentucky and Indiana close their polls early; they are also among the 20 states that will begin tallying early-voting ballots during Election Day. They should be good early sources of information. Both states figure to ultimately go for Trump, as they did in 2016, when AP actually jumped the gun by a minute with its first calls of the night. But, if they can\u2019t make the call right at 7:00\u2014and the longer it takes after that\u2014it might be a sign of trouble for Trump. On the other hand, Republicans could get a good sign if networks call the re-election of Kentucky\u2019s other U.S. Senator, Mitch McConnell, as quickly as they did Rand Paul\u2019s four years ago. Democrats spent a lot of money on Amy McGrath\u2019s quixotic bid against him; a quick call could signal trouble with races elsewhere that Democrats need to flip Senate control.  7:31pm 2018: ABC News reported that, according to preliminary exit polls, 30 percent of Georgia voters were Black. Networks love to dole out tidbits from exit polls from individual states\u2014combined, this year, with data on early voters\u2014that offer hints at the topline results they are careful not to share. You can compare against 2018 exit polls and 2016 exit polls to do your own punditry. In Georgia, where polls close at 7:00, Democrats hope to deliver surprising wins in three state-wide races: Biden for President; Jon Ossoff against U.S. Senate incumbent David Perdue; and in a special Senate election, Raphael Warnock against Republicans Kelly Loeffler and Doug Collins. The Senate races could head to January runoff elections if nobody reaches 50 percent. In 2018, exit polls showed the electorate 60 percent white, 30 percent Black, and 10 percent other; those same exit polls correctly suggested that Republican Brian Kemp held a slight edge over Democrat Stacey Abrams in the race for Governor. Early voting data in Georgia has been running at roughly the same proportion. For an early hint at Democrats\u2019 chances, watch for reports on whether the Black share of the state-wide vote this year exceeds that 30 percent threshold of Abrams\u2014or if Biden, Ossoff, and Warnock are exceeding Abrams\u2019s 25 percent showing among white voters.  7:53pm 2018: ABC News called VA-10 for Democrat Jennifer Wexton over Republican incumbent Barbara Comstock Wexton was the first red-to-blue flip two years ago, in an early sign of Democratic strength in suburban districts. This year, I\u2019d wager that honor might go to Democrat Carolyn Boureaux, facing Republican Rich McCormick for an open Republican seat north of Atlanta, Georgia. If, on the other hand, Tuesday turns out to be a good day for House Republicans, watch for an early red-to-blue flip in Virginia\u2019s second district, where Republican Scott Taylor tries to win his seat back from Elaine Luria; Virginia\u2019s seventh, where Nick Freitas is gunning for first-term Democrat Abigail Spanberger; or Oklahoma\u2019s fifth, where Republican Stephanie Bice faces first-term Democrat Kendra Horn.  8:19pm 2018: ABC News reported that preliminary exit polls showed that Republican voters outnumbered Democrats in Texas by five percentage points, down from nine in 2016 and 12 in 2014. With that five-point party edge, networks were able to declare Ted Cruz a narrow winner over Beto O\u2019Rourke for U.S. Senate by 10:10pm two years ago. The partisan advantage will need to come down further, presumably, for Democrats to succeed in their dream of winning Biden the state\u2019s 38 electoral votes, and perhaps even putting MJ Hegar into the U.S. Senate in place of Republican John Cornyn. Either would be national headline-making news. But another important result should be worth watching in the Texas state house of representative races. Democrats could gain the majority in that chamber by gaining nine seats. It\u2019s an uphill climb, but would give Democrats a seat at the table for redistricting, as well as state-wide lawmaking. I recommend bookmarking this election return site, and keeping an eye on returns from Denton, in north Texas, where Angela Brewer is trying to unseat Lynn Stuckey in the 64th district; and San Antonio, where Celine Montoya is gunning for Steve Allison in the 121st. Both of those Republicans figure to be hard to beat\u2014which is exactly why they could be leading indicators if Democrats have a chance.  10:06pm 2018: CNN called Kansas Secretary of State for Democrat Laura Kelly. This was the first statewide win for a Democrat in Kansas in almost a decade, and knocked out Trump ally Kris Kobach. This year, Democrats have visions of electing the party\u2019s first U.S. Senator from the state since 1932. State senator Barbara Bollier has been closing the polling gap against Republican congressman Roger Marshall, in the contest to succeed retiring Pat Roberts. Unfortunately, Kansas is not expected to start counting most early and mail-in ballots until after polls close at 8:00 eastern time, so depending on how efficient they are, results might not come as quickly as they did two years ago.  10:17pm 2018: Networks called CO-06 for Democratic challenger Jason Crow. Colorado has demonstrated in the past how to do a largely early-voting election and get results in nice and early. It is one of a dozen states that begin counting mail-in ballots even before Election Day; even though polls don\u2019t close until 9:00 eastern time, results tend to come quickly, even in close races like Crow\u2019s in 2018. Democrats need Biden to win the state, and for John Hickenlooper to beat incumbent Cory Gardner, to have realistic chances at controlling the White House and the Senate, respectively. Also, keep a lookout for the 3rd congressional district, where controversial Shooters Grill owner Lauren Boebert defeated incumbent Scott Tipton in the Republican primary. Boebert is favored to win on Tuesday, but if Democrat Diane Mitsch Bush beats her it could be an early sign of voters tiring of Trumpist candidates.  10:19pm 2016: NPR reported that major U.S. stock exchanges had dropped three percent in pre-market trading. Those in the media and political worlds practice caution in these situations; economic movers try to get ahead of what they see coming. After assuming a Hillary Clinton victory, overnight markets\u2014including the value of the Mexican peso\u2014adjusted to growing signs of Trump\u2019s strength well before anybody officially called key states for him. Although a Trump re-election would maintain the status quo, there is evidence that markets have begun pricing in expectations of a Biden victory next week. Convulsions in futures trading could be signs that wealthy institutional insiders see evidence that Trump might pull it off again.  10:34pm 2016: AP called North Carolina\u2019s U.S. Senate race for Republican Richard Burr. North Carolina was expected to be a major battleground four years ago. The Presidential race and Burr\u2019s re-election were considered toss-ups. Despite the state\u2019s early 7:30 poll closing time, and efficient tallying system, many expected to be waiting for crucial North Carolina results well into the night. Instead, Burr defeated Deborah Ross by five percentage points, all but dashing hopes of Democratic control of the Senate at an early hour. A little more than a half-hour later networks called the state for Trump. This year, again, pundits see North Carolina up for grabs. Democrat Cal Cunningham\u2019s challenge to Thom Tillis is considered essential to the party\u2019s path to Senate control; that race, and the Presidential outcome, are rated by forecasters as tossups or even a slight advantage for Democrats. Democrats also hope to pick up U.S. House seats, following court-ordered redistricting.  10:50pm 2016: AP called Florida for Donald Trump. Amid concerns of a long, drawn-out, multi-day ballot count in key states, there is considerable optimism about a snappier process in Florida. State officials have told the New York Times that it should report all of its mail and early in-person votes by 8:30 pm, a mere 90 minutes after polls close. Four years ago, with a final margin of barely over one percentage point, the AP was able to call the state before the end of prime time on the East Coast. Since it\u2019s a must-win state for Trump, the feeling among some political insiders is that a lot of heartache and angst might be avoided if networks declare Biden the winner there before Americans go to bed Tuesday night. That might, of course, be wishful thinking.  11:00pm 2018: ABC News declared a runoff in a special election for U.S. Senate in Mississippi, between Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith and Democrat Mike Espy. If we\u2019re going to see big Democratic gains in the U.S. Senate\u2014enough to not only give them the majority, but a real chance to take on big progressive projects\u2014the Hyde-Smith/Espy rematch could be the key upset. Polling suggests that Espy trails by roughly the same nine points by which he lost the runoff two years ago, but that lead has been narrowing.  Wednesday 12:36am 2018: AP called Maine\u2019s gubernatorial race for Democrat Janet Mills. Enormous attention has focused on Democrat Sara Gideon\u2019s challenge to Republican U.S. Senator Susan Collins. It would be hyperbolic to say, as some have, that this is the last stand for moderate New England Republicans. But it would certainly be hard for Democrats to take control of the U.S. Senate without winning this race. The last big state-wide contest, won by Mills, got called at this relatively reasonable hour by AP; some networks weren\u2019t convinced until nearly ten in the morning. That\u2019s because Mills needed to top 50 percent to avoid Maine\u2019s relatively new ranked-choice voting process, and ended up with 50.1. Neither Gideon nor Collins have topped 50 percent in polls to date, thanks to independent candidates David Gibson and Lisa Savage. If the results do require a ranked-choice runoff, Gideon is presumed to have the advantage, as she figures to be the second choice of Savage supporters. But it might be quite a while longer until we find out for sure. How much longer? In 2018, Democrat Jared Golden won the ranked-choice runoff process in Maine\u2019s second congressional district, over Republican Bruce Poliquin, at 2:06 pm\u2014on November 15th, nine days after Election Day.  1:14am 2018: CNN reported that California has rejected a rent control ballot measure. California ballot questions\u2014crucial, in the most populous state in the country\u2014can occupy your worried mind as the hour gets later and the battlegrounds remain uncalled. A huge battle has played out there over Proposition 22, which would undo a recent state law and re-classify ride-share drivers as independent contractors, rather than employees. On the criminal justice front, Proposition 17 would restore voting rights to felons on parole. Further justice propositions are being considered locally in Los Angeles and San Francisco. It\u2019s also worth watching the Los Angeles County District Attorney election, where progressives are hoping George Gascon can unseat Jackie Lacey, putting a reform-minded prosecutor in charge in one of the country\u2019s largest jurisdictions.  2:01am 2016: AP called Nebraska\u2019s 2nd district for Trump. There are plausible scenarios in which the Presidential election comes down to this Omaha-based district, in one of two states, with Maine, to award electoral college votes by congressional district. If so, two in the morning might be an optimistic timetable for the result. That district\u2019s congressional race wasn\u2019t called for another eight hours in 2016.  2:30am 2016: AP called Wisconsin for Trump, and declared him the winner based on surpassing 270 electoral votes. Pennsylvania had been called an hour earlier; Michigan remained too close to call. Those three states, narrowly won by Trump but polling in Biden\u2019s direction this year, have all been targets of controversy concerning ballot eligibility, access, and counting. They might all be easily called by midnight; any or all could drag out in courts for weeks. This year, the state that sets off the champagne could be Arizona. It is already counting early mail ballots, and will report those tallies when polls close at 10:00 eastern time. It sounds like the state will avoid the 2018 scenario, when processing of early votes left the outcome in flux for a week. In addition to perhaps being the state that officially gets one of the Presidential candidates over the 270 electoral vote line, Arizona could provide the key U.S. Senate result establishing control of that chamber. If all goes smoothly, that race between Republican Martha McSally and Democrat Mark Kelly, could be resolved before midnight on the east coast.  10:25am 2016: AP called Montana Governor election for Steve Bullock. Of the 11 states (and two territories) electing governors this year, only one looks like a close race\u2014but it\u2019s a barn-burner. Democrat Steve Bullock is term-limited out; his Lieutenant Governor, Mike Cooney, is trying to keep the seat blue. The Republican nominee is first-term at-large congressman Greg Gianforte, best known outside the state for body-slamming reporter Ben Jacobs of The Guardian during his 2018 campaign. Bullock himself, after an ill-fated play for the Presidential nomination, is challenging Republican incumbent Steve Daines for the U.S. Senate. And, there is a good race for the U.S. House race opened by Gianforte. It took until well into Wednesday morning to call Bullock\u2019s four-point win four years ago, and almost exactly as long for U.S. Senator Jon Tester\u2019s re-election in 2018. If networks call any of this year\u2019s three big state-wide races for the Republicans before you fall asleep, consider it a good sign for the GOP keeping its rural advantage.  5:46pm 2018: AP called Alaska gubernatorial race for Republican Mike Dunleavy. Notoriously difficult to poll, quirky in its political leanings, and planning not to report any mailed vote counts until the following week, Alaska will likely get little attention. But the state just might elect the country\u2019s third Democratic-caucusing Independent. Al Gross, an orthopedic surgeon, would join Vermont\u2019s Bernie Sanders and Maine\u2019s Angus King if he upsets Republican Dan Sullivan. Gross has raised big bucks from progressives throughout the lower 48. Sullivan, meanwhile, tripped himself up by supporting the Pebble Mine gold project, which offends Alaskans\u2019 environmentalist side without appealing to their pro-oil side. Two major political forecasters recently shifted this race from Likely Republican to Lean Republican; unfortunately, as noted, if the race is close you\u2019ll need to wait for them to get around to the mail-in ballots.

        "body": "There are 50 contested races among the 200 legislative districts on the ballot Tuesday, with Republicans facing headwinds from a strong anti-Trump voted expected in Massachusetts and hoping to stem the tide of losses they absorbed during special elections this year.The numbers show a widespread lack of interest in serving on Beacon Hill, where Democrats have held supermajorities in both branches for nearly three decades, and there are some energized races to be settled.Most of the action is in House districts, where 34 incumbents face challengers and candidates are competing for eight open seats, in addition to the seven open seats settled during the Sept. 1 primaries.Two of the eight open seats are held by outgoing Republicans, Reps. Randy Hunt of Sandwich and Elizabeth Poirier of North Attleborough. Five are represented by retiring Democrats: Reps. Jose Tosado of Springfield, Thomas Petrolati of Ludlow, Stephan Hay of Fitchburg, Theodore Speliotis of Danvers and Harold Naughton of Worcester.The eighth open House seat is currently vacant after former Democrat Rep. John Velis of Westfield won a special election to the Senate in May.There are contested races in eight of the 40 Senate districts and no open Senate seats. Democrats snatched two GOP Senate seats in special elections, and Republicans currently represent only four districts.In the House, Democrats hold 127 of 160 seats, while Republicans hold 31. One district is represented by an independent lawmaker, while one remains vacant.SHNS Senate RacesHere's a look at some races to keep an eye on:-- Three Senate Republicans Challenged: Democrats reduced the six-man Senate GOP caucus to four this year after two Republican senators left for other opportunities and Democrats picked up their seats in a pair of May special elections. Of the remaining Republicans, only Minority Leader Bruce Tarr is running unopposed. Sutton Republican Sen. Ryan Fattman faces a challenge from Milford Democrat Christine Crean, a social worker. On the South Shore, Cohasset Democrat Meg Wheeler is challenging Sen. Patrick O'Connor, a Weymouth Republican. And in north central Massachusetts, voters will decide between Fitchburg Republican Sen. Dean Tran and Lunenburg Democrat John Cronin. Before Tran, who came to America as a refugee and is the state's first Vietnamese-American senator, was elected in a 2017 special election, Democrats had held the seat since 1993. A late March report from the Senate Ethics Committee -- which Tran derided as a politically motivated attack -- found that his office staff had been improperly engaged in campaign work during business hours, leading to his removal from the post of assistant minority whip. Cronin, an Army veteran who served in Afghanistan and is completing a law degree at Suffolk University, is running with the backing of a host of local Democrats, including U.S. Reps. Lori Trahan and Jim McGovern, outgoing state Reps. Stephan Hay and Harold Naughton, and Jennifer Flanagan, whose resignation for a seat on the Cannabis Control Commission cleared the way for Tran to join the Senate. Both campaigns have reported spending notable amounts -- Cronin reported spending more than $27,000 in September alone, and Tran more than $40,000, according to the Office of Campaign and Political Finance. - Katie Lannan-- GOP Active in Coastal Competition South of Boston: Ever since he won his seat in 2012, barely an election goes by without Democrats casting a nervous eye toward Rep. Josh Cutler and the Sixth Plymouth District. The South Shore district was held by Republican Dan Webster before Cutler won it for the Democrats, and he's had to fight to keep it ever since. After his first win in 2012 by 10 points, his margin of victory in the Duxbury-Hanson-Pembroke district narrowed to eight points in his 2014 race against Republican Joseph Sheehan. He had an easier time two years later, and ran unopposed in 2018, but Republicans are again hoping to retake the seat. Cutler, now of Pembroke, is running against Tatyana Medvedev Semyrog of his former hometown Duxbury. A widow and mother of three, Semyrog is touting support from police and pointing to her work in a number of Congressional offices, including former U.S. Sen. Scott Brown's office. Cutler's district is one in a corridor along the South Shore where competition for legislative seats is running hot. Rep. Kathy LaNatra of Kingston is running for a second term after winning in 2018 with just over 52 percent of the vote. She's up against Republican Summer Schmaling, a biology researcher from Halifax who has studied arsenic in drinking water and the influenza. First-term Rep. Patrick Kearney of Scituate also has a Republican challenger, Craig Valdez, with competitive Senate races from Weymouth to Falmouth helping to stir up voter interest along the entire coast. Republicans have controlled a few districts on Cape Cod and in Plymouth County, and they are trying to stitch together more red districts leading up the South Shore coast toward the district represented by Republican Rep. David DeCoste of Norwell. To do so, they'll need to hold the district that Sandwich Republican Rep. Randy Hunt is giving up. Republican Steven Xiarhos of Barnstable is competing against Democrat James Dever of Sandwich in that race for the First Barnstable District. - Matt Murphy and Michael P. Norton-- Sen. Rausch v. Matt Kelly: Voters in the Senate district that snakes from Wayland down into Attleboro have a choice between Franklin Republican Matt Kelly, in his first campaign for state-level office, and Needham Democrat Sen. Becca Rausch, who herself unseated a Republican two years ago. This is the district that former U.S. Sen. Scott Brown represented when he served in the state Senate. Rausch turned the Norfolk, Bristol and Middlesex District blue when she defeated Brown's successor, former Republican Sen. Richard Ross of Wrentham, by about 2,000 votes in 2018 to become just the second Democrat to represent the district - the other was Cheryl Jacques. Before running for Senate, Rausch worked as a health care attorney in the Patrick and Baker administrations and had been elected as a member of Needham Town Meeting. For the last 12 years, Kelly has served in elected roles on the Town Council and School Committee in Franklin, where he has lived since the early 1990s and where he operates a real estate business. When he announced his first run for state-level office earlier this year, Kelly said that \"the majority of voters in this district are fed up with narrow agendas and a lack of concern for the bread-and-butter issues that each of our community's face.\" - Colin A. YoungMass Senate Districts In Play On Election Day 2020-- North Attleborough Councilors Square Off: Two North Attleborough Town Council members are running to replace retiring Rep. Elizabeth Poirier, the second assistant minority leader. Republican John Simmons is hoping to keep the district that includes all of North Attleborough and parts of Mansfield and Attleboro red with the backing of Poirier and Gov. Charlie Baker. Simmons got into the race late, in early September, after another Republican hopeful backed out. A North Attleborough native, Simmons is a lawyer, Boy Scout leader and youth sports coach. He has served as a member of the town's elected Representative Town Meeting and Election Commission, and serves on the first Town Council since the town changed its form of government. Democrat Adam Scanlon is hoping to win the 14th Bristol District for the Democrats with the backing of outgoing Congressman Joseph Kennedy III and former Gov. Michael Dukakis. Before being elected to the Town Council, Scanlon served on the town's School Committee. He says he currently works for \"a social services organization that assists economically disadvantaged citizens with job placement\" and is pursuing a master's degree from Northeastern University. 2021 will be the first time the 14th Bristol District is represented by anyone other than a Poirier since Gerald Ford was in the White House. Elizabeth Poirier was elected in a 1999 special election to succeed her husband, Kevin, who had represented the district in the Massachusetts House since his first election in 1976. - Colin A. Young-- The Battle of Westfield: The more than 41,000 residents of Westfield have had no representation in the Massachusetts House since May, when former Rep. John Velis, a Democrat, won a special election to fill a Senate seat. Voters will choose whether to fill that vacuum with Democrat Matt Garlo, Republican Kelly Pease or Independent Compassionate Conservative Ethan Flaherty. Pease, a retired Army officer and former Chester selectman, has experience on Beacon Hill already, spending a year as a legislative aide for former Sen. Donald Humason. Pease describes himself as \"a conservative who believes that government shouldn't just continue to raise taxes but should stay within their budget like every working family\" and a Second Amendment supporter. Garlo studied political science, sociology and pre-law at Siena College, where he earned a degree in May 2019, and is running his first-ever campaign on a platform including securing additional funding for schools and state reimbursement for contaminated water treatment. Although Garlo is a year removed from college, he is not the field's youngest candidate: Flaherty is a recent high school graduate. Republicans will eye the Fourth Hampden District as a potential pickup -- the GOP carried the district from 1978 to Velis's first victory in 2014 with candidates like Humason, Cele Hahn, Michael Knapik and Steven Pierce, and even with Velis in office, it has leaned toward Republican candidates in other races. - Chris Lisinski-- Warren-Backed Challenger Eyes House GOP Leader: The last time a Democrat ran against House Minority Leader Brad Jones, it was 2008, and Jones, who's served in the House since 1995, handily won reelection with 71 percent of the vote. This year, Michelle Mullet's bid against the longtime incumbent has attracted attention from outside their shared hometown of North Reading. Boston City Councilor Julia Mejia endorsed Mullet, as has U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who said Mullet would be the first woman and first Latina to represent the district and is \"leading on progressive ideas that will bring about big change \u2014 like implementing a Massachusetts Green New Deal, protecting and expanding access to reproductive care, and ensuring campaign finance reform is a priority on Beacon Hill.\" Jones is running with the backing of Gov. Charlie Baker, who said in an endorsement video that he wants to make sure voters know Jones has done \"a terrific job representing the people of his district and the people of the commonwealth in his role as minority leader for as long as I've been in state government.\" Despite Jones' long tenure in the Legislature, Baker said he \"fights with the enthusiasm of a newcomer\" and called him \"a problem-solver and a bipartisan operator at a time when we need much more of both.\" - Katie Lannan-- Lyons Looms Over Nguyen v. Dufour Contest: Democrat Rep. Tram Nguyen of Andover faces a challenge in her first re-election campaign from political newcomer Jeff Dufour of Tewskbury. DuFour, a Republican who has spent his career in information systems and project management, is vying to flip the seat back to the GOP after Nguyen ousted four-term Rep. Jim Lyons by a nearly 10-point margin two years ago -- a result that cleared the way for Lyons, a vocal Trump supporter and abortion opponent, to take the reins of the Massachusetts Republican Party. During her first term, Nguyen has joined in the push for natural gas safety in the wake of the 2018 Merrimack Valley explosions and for passage of the ROE Act, which would expand access to abortion. The state Democratic Party asked authorities for an investigation into a string of race-baiting robocalls in the district, which, according to a Boston Globe report, claimed to support Nguyen but misrepresented her positions, saying she supported defunding the police and \"making white Americans pay tax reparations.\" - Chris Lisinski-- Four Special Election Rematches: The four newest members of the House and Senate face rematches against opponents they defeated in special elections earlier this year, with a much higher turnout looming as the major difference this time around. Candidates on both sides of the aisle will be relatively fresh in voters' minds, having already campaigned in the spring, but the newly minted legislators have only a few months' record that they can tout or their challengers can critique. In three of those races, Democrats -- Sens. John Velis and Susan Moran and Rep. Carol Doherty -- will be looking to hang on to formerly red seats they flipped and are now running with the advantages of incumbency. In the fourth, Acton Democrat Rep. Danillo Sena will go another round against Lunenburg Republican Catherine Clark, whom he defeated 74 percent to 26 percent in June. In Taunton, Doherty had topped Republican Kelly Dooner 57-43 for the House seat formerly held by Mayor Shaunna O'Connell, and on Cape Cod, Moran, a Falmouth Democrat, bested Bourne Republican Jay McMahon -- a supporter of President Trump who ran for attorney general in 2018 -- by a similar margin of 56-44. What's now Moran's seat has bounced between Democrats and Republicans, last held by Plymouth Republican Vinny deMacedo and before that by former Senate President Therese Murray, a Plymouth Democrat. Velis, a Westfield Democrat, had been serving as a state representative until he claimed the seat vacated by Westfield Mayor Donald Humason in a May special election by beating Southwick Republican John Cain 64-36. - Katie Lannan-- Indy Candidates Try to Make a Dent: Unenrolled voters are the largest voter group in Massachusetts, but only one of the 200 sitting state lawmakers is not enrolled in one of the two major parties. Rep. Susannah Whipps of Athol had been a Republican until 2017, when she switched to an independent, and she faces a challenge from Athol Democrat William LaRose on Tuesday. Six other races involve only a sitting Republican or Democrat and a single independent challenger: Democrat Sen. John Keenan of Quincy vs. independent candidate Alexander Mendez of Quincy; Democrat Rep. Thomas Stanley of Waltham vs. unenrolled candidate George Darcy of Waltham; Democrat Rep. Michael Day of Stoneham vs. non-party candidate Elizabeth Harrah of Winchester; Democrat Rep. Danielle Gregoire of Marlborough vs. independent candidate Syed Hashmi of Westborough; Democrat Rep. Jerald Parisella of Beverly vs. unenrolled independent candidate Euplio Marciano of Beverly; and Republican Rep. Paul Frost of Auburn vs. independent candidate Terry Dotson of Millbury. - Chris Lisinski",

        "body": "Don't underestimate the power of doodling. In a democracy, says Mo Willems, \"voting is a lot like doodling. It's a form of self-expression and you discover sort of who you really are as you do it.\" On Election Day (7:00 pm EST/4:00 pm PST) on the Kennedy Center's website, Willems will encourage self-expression for anyone who tunes in, regardless of age or political persuasion. Willems says they'll do three drawing exercises, each accompanied by a different musician from the National Symphony Orchestra. As the Kennedy Center's Education Artist-in-Residence, Willems has been encouraging kids to take regular doodle breaks since the early days of the pandemic.In a video series called Lunch Doodles with Mo Willems!, he held guided drawing sessions from his studio. He sits at a table, pulls out a blank sheet of paper, selects a marker and starts doodling, encouraging kids at home to do the same. He answers kids' questions and talks about his career as an animator and writer for Sesame Street and creating The Pigeon and Gerald & Piggie books. Lunch Doodles has been so popular, Willems followed it up with similar series: Thank You Thursdays, The Yo-Yo Mo Show with cellist Yo-Yo Ma and, most recently, The Small Works Project. \"I tend to think of my books as questions I don't know the answers to and these videos are sort of me reflecting,\" Willems tells me in an interview. \"I'm going to be anxious on November 3rd. And I know that they're going to be a lot of families and kids learning new vocabulary words while parents are yelling at the screens.

        "body": "Boston Mayor Marty Walsh is urging calm on and after Election Day, especially in the very possible scenario that there is not a clear winner in the presidential race by Wednesday or later. Walsh is also reminding any residents voting in person to continue to observe safety measures around the coronavirus, including wearing masks and standing at least six feet apart from others. Acknowledging heightened anxiety over the election, Walsh reiterated assurances that there are no known threats to public safety in Boston or anywhere in the commonwealth, and said the city is prepared to ensure a peaceful election and a safe public environment in the days and weeks that follow. To that end, Walsh and Boston Police Commissioner William Gross said that while they welcome lawful and civil demonstrations from across the political spectrum, acts of voter intimidation or any other lawlessness will not be tolerated, and the Boston Police Department is prepared to deploy quickly and aggressively in the case such incidents arise. \u201cI want to make it clear that voter intimidation is against the law and it won't be tolerated,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cAlso, I'm asking voters to respect the views of the people that might be standing there for different candidates, [to] respect their opinion as well.\u201d Gross said the BPD will be deploying a significant police presence throughout the city. \u201cWe want you to be comfortable in the fact that the Boston Police Department will be covering all polling sites,\u201d Gross said, noting that state law allows police officers to be present inside polling places, as well as outside. \u201cWe want everyone to know that we also have coverage for the neighborhoods, places of worship, schools, hospitals \u2013 you will see us out there.\u201d The enhanced presence of law enforcement and other public safety officials, Gross said, is simply \u201cfor the assurance that everybody is able to exercise their vote freely.\u201d Walsh also sought to reassure the public that while this may be an unusual election year, that should not erode faith in the integrity of the voting process, in Boston or nationally. \u201cWe should not be surprised if we don't hear a clear national result tomorrow night or Wednesday morning or for several days. That does not mean that the voting process is broken or compromised in any way,\u201d Walsh said. The mayor noted that while he expects election results will be clear for Boston and Massachusetts relatively early, Boston and other cities, like communities around the country, will likely be counting absentee ballots for several days following the election. \u201cBut I want to make it clear that mail-in ballots do not fundamentally change the process or cause a problem\u201d in election results, Walsh said. \u201cThey are handled like traditional absentee ballots. That's how we've always counted the votes of the military members and those people that are voting from overseas or out of state and the process of counting and certifying election results always takes a number of days before the election.\u201d ",

        "body": "LONDONDERRY, N.H. -- By Monday mid-morning, some two dozen volunteers were working in pairs at long tables spaced across the basketball court in a high school gym. In front of each pair sat boxes packed tightly with white envelopes. Stuffed inside those envelopes were the absentee ballots of about 25 percent of the registered electorate in the state\u2019s eighth biggest town. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing today is partially preprocessing absentee ballots that have been received up until midnight last night,\u201d said Jonathan Kipp, Londonderry's town manager, who is overseeing operations here at Londonderry High School. New Hampshire doesn\u2019t offer early voting in person. But like most states, it has expanded absentee, or mail-in, voting this year in response to concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic. A record 180,000-plus New Hampshire voters have cast absentee ballots, including about 5,000 in Londonderry.\u201cWe\u2019re ahead of schedule,\u201d Kipp said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got such great workers here. They\u2019re going really fast. We were prepared to be here until 7 tonight. I\u2019m hoping we\u2019ll be done by maybe one or two o\u2019clock.\u201dThis partial preprocessing consists of opening the outer envelope, announcing the name of the voter so that poll observers can hear, and checking for anything that might cause that ballot to be rejected, such as a missing \u2014 or unsigned \u2014 inner envelope. \u201cTo be clear, no ballots are counted today,\u201d Kipp said. \u201cTomorrow on Election Day we will open the inner envelope and actually cast the ballots.\u201dLondonderry, NH, Town ManagerPreprocessing ballots is not universal across the 50 states. In the crucial battleground states of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, it cannot begin until Election Day, which is one of the reasons their results might not be known on election night. But it is allowed here in New Hampshire. Kipp said it serves two crucial purposes. First, he said, it will speed things up tomorrow when the votes are actually cast. And second, if something is amiss, it allows officials a chance to contact voters and offer them a chance to fix, or \u201ccure,\u201d their ballot before tomorrow, so that their vote can be validated and counted. \u201cIn fact, we\u2019ve already had one come down and cure his vote,\u201d he said. \u201cThe process works.\u201dKipp said despite the record number of absentee ballots, he still expects a busy day  tomorrow at the only polling location in Londonderry. Here, from 6 am until 8 pm, election workers will feed all those absentee ballots into the machines while also managing thousands of in-person voters.\u201cWe are one of the largest [polling locations] in the country, quite frankly. We have over 20,000 registered voters, and this is the only place they go,\u201d he said. Kipp expects lines at times throughout the day but is confident the operation will run smoothly. And despite what he called a \u201ccomplex and complicated\u201d election season, he\u2019s looking forward to tomorrow. \u201cVoting is just such an American thing to do. It\u2019s always exciting to have an election,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll be quite honest, I\u2019m also looking forward to having it be over. Ask my wife. She hasn\u2019t seen me for it seems like weeks now.\u201d",

Charlie Baker Monday as a second wave of COVID-19 starts to hit hospitals.\"We can't afford to continue to do what we've been doing,\" Baker said, adding that the new restrictions are aimed to prevent the state from having to drop back to Phase 2 or Phase 1 of its reopening plan.A new stay-at-home advisory will also go into effect Friday, requiring residents to stay indoors between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m.COVID-19 cases in Massachusetts have been on the rise for weeks and the state has seen over 1,000 new cases of the virus every day for over a week, with over 2,400 cases diagnosed over the Halloween weekend.Baker said the state has let down its guard when it comes to safety protocols and that has caused the sustained increase in COVID cases and a 145% increase in hospitalizations. The state has also suffered over 10,000 deaths as a result of the disease. There were 602 patients hospitalized with the disease as of Sunday evening.\"If we do nothing and stay on the track we're on now, we'll create capacity problems for our health care system by the end of the calendar year,\" Baker said.The changes are some of the toughest restrictions Baker has put in place since the summer, when transmission rates declined and the state established a four-stage reopening plan. Restricting restaurant service to 9:30 p.m. is intended to allow customers to return home by the start of the 10 p.m. stay-at-home advisory.The new advisory, combined with the 10-person limit on private indoor gatherings, will allow local authorities to crack down on house parties that Baker says are one of the biggest culprits behind the state's spread.\"Do I expect everybody to follow these rules? No. But if there's one thing I've learned since the beginning of this, it's a vast majority of people in Massachusetts are rule-followers and if you give them rules and guidance, they will do it,\" Baker said.Baker described the new mask order \"as guidance\" similar to the existing order.\"But the difference here is we're eliminating the six foot spread. We're basically saying if you go out in public, wear a mask,\" the governor said.",

        "body": "U.S. District Court Judge Andrew Hanen today threw out a suit challenging the legality of some 127,000 votes cast at drive-through voting sites in the Houston area. He ruled the plaintiffs don't have legal standing to sue. Harris County, Texas' most populous county, and majority-Democratic, erected ten tents to expedite the early voting process, as a way of allowing people to vote safely during the coronavirus pandemic.  They were also in place this summer, prior to the state's primary.  Noting that, Judge Hanen, a George W. Bush appointee, asked plaintiffs \"Why am I just getting this case?\"The suit was brought by a group of Republican activists, who argued the move by Harris County Clerk Chris Hollins, a Democrat, was an illegal expansion of curbside voting, which is permitted under Texas law. A similar challenge had been dismissed by the Texas Supreme Court Sunday. All of that court's were appointed by Republicans. One of the intervenors in the hearing, ACLU lawyer Andre Segura, argued that a ruling allowing the ballots to be thrown out would cause people to have to vote a second time. \"Once the egg has been scrambled it doesn't make sense to put it back in the egg,\" Segura said, adding: \"We're talking about a very large scramble.\"Other attorneys said some of the affected voters were receiving medical treatment and would be unable to get to the polls on Election Day.The Texas case is one of a number of legal challenges to voting and ballot counting, many of them brought by Republicans.

        "body": "Another 1.3 million people are projected to cast their ballots on Tuesday, and when added to the 2.3 million people who have already voted the anticpated turnout would set a new record during an intense and unusual presidential election cycle.Secretary of State William Galvin on Monday forecast that total turnout would surpass the 3.3 million record set in the 2016 presidential election, by more than 300,000 people. He said polling places -- which will be open from 7 a.m. until 8 p.m. Tuesday -- will be safe from a public health standpoint, with COVID-19 precautions in place, and that elections officials are expecting a \"very orderly day.\"More than 4.8 million people are now registered to vote in Massachusetts, according to Galvin, who said there has been \"a consistent increase in voter registration\" and a decline in the number of inactive voters.\"We've seen a lot of activity from voters who have not had particularly active histories,\" Galvin said. \"We've seen a tremendous uptick in interest, even among people and areas of the state where we generally don't see that.\"Each polling place will have a police officer present, and Galvin said political party chairs have been advised that while they may station observers at voting locations, those observers cannot interact with voters. The State Police plan to increase staffing on and after Election Day, and the department's head, Col. Christopher Mason, said they are not aware of any specific or credible threats to election sites.\"We believe that tomorrow we will see, as I said, a large turnout, but we believe it will be an orderly turnout,\" Galvin said. \"We will insist on order. If, in fact, there is any effort to disrupt the polls tomorrow by any means, whether it's by drive-by caravans or anything else, we will insist that law enforcement take action immediately to make sure the polls remain accessible.\"Galvin also pushed back against President Donald Trump's criticisms of the expanded vote-by-mail programs that many states, including Massachusetts, have adopted this year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.Mail-in ballots received on or before Tuesday, ballots cast during the early voting period, and ballots cast on Election Day will be counted after polls close Tuesday night. Ballots postmarked by Tuesday that are received by 5 p.m. Friday will also be counted, and ballots mailed from overseas can be counted if they are postmarked by Tuesday and arrive by 5 p.m. on Nov. 13, according to Galvin's office.Galvin, a Brighton Democrat, said he considers comments that Trump has made about counting mailed ballots after Election Day to be \"appalling, disturbing and really criminal.\" On Friday, the president tweeted, \"The Election should end on November 3rd., not weeks later!\"\"Here in Massachusetts, it has been our practice for many, many years that members of the military, if they voted and had their ballot postmarked by the date of the election, their ballot would be counted even if it was received up to 10 days later,\" Galvin said. \"To suggest that somehow this is criminal or this is improper or this is illegal is disgraceful and criminal. These are people who serve our country and to suggest that somehow they should be deprived of the right to vote because somehow, through no fault of their own, their ballot is not received by the close of the polls is simply unacceptable.\"In addition to the presidential contest between Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden, all nine Congressional seats and all 200 seats in the state Legislature are on the ballot. U.S. Sen. Ed Markey is running for reelection against Republican challenger Kevin O'Connor, and two ballot questions to be decided address vehicle data access and ranked-choice voting for future elections.Galvin said he expects results to be known in Massachusetts Tuesday night. The voting rights group MassVOTE also does not expect any issues with the tallying here, a spokesman said.Alex Psilakis, MassVOTE's policy and communications manager, told the News Service that Question 2, the ranked-choice voting initiative, is \"the only statewide issue in Massachusetts I could see taking a little bit longer\" to know the definitive outcome.\"Polling seems to indicate a lot of races, at least statewide races, having a pretty clear winner in mind,\" he said.Psilakis said his organization is also anticipating record turnout, and will be \"working really hard\" to get voters out in cities like Boston and Springfield, where the turnout so far has been lower than in suburban communities.So far, 159,000 Bostonians have voted, for a turnout of more than 36.5 percent as of Monday, Mayor Martin Walsh said. He said the city \"will at least meet if not shatter\" its 2016 record of 66.75 percent turnout.For those who are following results nationally, Walsh advised them to \"be prepared for the process to take some time.\"\"I ask everyone to remain calm. Practice self care and focus on what we can do here in Boston to set a good example and a national example,\" Walsh said.Galvin, who is among the Boston voters planning to cast a ballot on Tuesday, said the areas that participated most in early and mail-in voting were suburbs, and many larger and mid-sized cities \"have not really participated\" at the same level.\"In fact, in many of those places less than a quarter of the eligible voters have taken advantage of early voting or vote-by-mail,\" he said. \"That means they'll be coming out tomorrow, and those places which we've looked closely at we've seen a high level of interest.\"Colin A. Young contributed reporting. ",

        "body": "Members of the Brookline Educators Union have overwhelmingly voted to go on strike, beginning Tuesday, over concerns about maintaining social distancing guidelines within school buildings. During ongoing bargaining agreements, Union President Jessica Wender-Shubow urged school officials to formally commit to 6 feet of social distancing in classrooms and throughout schools. Brookline Superintendent of Schools James Marini said he could not promise to maintain a 6-foot rule. He wrote in a statement to GBH News Monday that \u201ctaking any action that would limit our ability to adapt is irresponsible and would fly in the face of science and fact-based decision-making.\u201d Wender-Shubow said in an interview with GBH News Monday that the \u201cschool district wants to unilaterally allow the superintendent to decide how much social distancing there is based on his own personal interpretation of \u2018best practices.\u2019\u201dIn August, the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education issued guidelines that a distance of 6 feet is \u201cpreferred whenever feasible,\u201d but 3 feet would be a \u201cminimum acceptable distance\u201d when combined with masks and other safety measures. \u201cDr. Marini has said repeatedly that he does not anticipate changing the 6-foot distancing unless something significant happens to change our understanding of best practices,\u201d Marini\u2019s statement reads. \u201cThis last part is key: best practices can change.\u201dThe School Committee voted Monday to file a petition for the Massachusetts Department of Labor Relations to investigate the educators' proposed strike. \u201cThey're bringing the Department of Labor against us rather than try to work this out,\u201d Wender-Shubow told GBH News. \u201cThis is about a process, this isn\u2019t about not working. \u2026 The teachers here were already feeling like things were not being handled in a responsible, even remotely predictable and transparent way.\u201d The School Committee asked the union to reconsider the strike, but Wender-Shubow said direct action is in the best interest of the union\u2019s 1,200 members, 90% of whom voted Sunday night in favor of the strike. \u201cWhat would I say to all of those educators? What would I say to them that had changed? Nothing has changed,\u201d Wender-Shubow said. \u201cSo what, they threatened me. We already knew that we were taking a risk, they should thank us for doing it. They should thank us for standing up for these kids and for one another. All we're asking for is process.\u201dMore than 500 of the union\u2019s members live in Boston, where Mayor Marty Walsh called for schools to roll back to remote learning after a spike in COVID-19 cases last month. \u201cSo you want people coming and going into the city, day in and day out, and you will not commit even to a process that is fair, to community standards,\u201d Wender-Shubow said. \u201cSo we said, let\u2019s say when the CDC and the Massachusetts Commissioner of Public Health say that we can relax those standards, we will then sit down with you and figure out the logistics, we\u2019ll bargain with you. They said no.\u201dThough education unions and school committees in Arlington, Boston, Hanover, Hingham, Milton, Wellesley and Weston have reached agreements that include 6 feet of social distancing, Marini argued in his statement that flexibility will be necessary to ensure safety for students and staff members. \u201cBecause of this rapidly-evolving situation, [Public Schools of Brookline] must retain the ability to continue to adhere to best practices,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cAt any point before the end of the school year, the optimal mix of protective measures may be very different and less reliant on distancing.\u201d Members of the teachers' union can\u2019t move forward on those terms, Wender-Shubow said. \u201cThey feel so disrespected and so rightfully scared that there's nobody watching this, that all the public health stuff is just a little bit too arbitrary.\u201d ",

        "body": "Updated at 6:13 p.m. Gov. Charlie Baker proposed sweeping changes to the state\u2019s program for contracting with minority-owned businesses, including provisions to directly address criticisms raised in a year-long investigative series by the GBH News Center for Investigative Reporting.GBH News reported this year that the value of state contracts won by minority-owned businesses has declined by more that 24% over the past two decades, and that the state was padding its results by taking credit for payments that non-minority state contractors made to minority-owned businesses and nonprofits that had no direct connection to a state project. Baker\u2019s legislative proposal, unveiled Monday evening in advance of the election, essentially confirms that the state\u2019s Supplier Diversity Office has not had enough independent authority to ensure that other state agencies are making minority contracting a priority.Baker\u2019s office announced that his bill would elevate the state Supplier Diversity Office into a stand-alone agency \u201cwith tools and resources to ensure accountability and compliance with diversity goals, oversee agency diversity spending, and audit and review spending data.\u201d The new agency would have a \u201cSupplier Diversity Compliance Unit \u2026 which will systematically audit and review direct and indirect spending data to ensure compliance and accuracy.\u201d GBH News reported in September that state agency documentation of minority businesses contracts was riddled with errors and inconsistencies.Baker also announced that in the future, the state\u2019s annual supplier diversity report will separate state contracts with minority businesses from payments made to minority businesses by non-minority contractors. The reports will also itemize minority businesses spending by race and ethnicity. GBH News had requested this data from the state but was told it was not being tracked. The state will also boost the advantage given to bidders on state contracts to those that include strong minority business participation in their proposals. \u201cIn launching these new initiatives, we have worked closely with leaders in the minority business community, Black and Latino Caucus, and Black Advisory Commission and Latino Advisory Commission,\u201d Baker said in a statement Monday. \u201cWe look forward to continuing our work with these partners to strengthen the state contracting process with greater diversity, transparency and accountability.\u201d Deborah Enos, chair of the Black Advisory Commission, said in the same statement, \u201cExpanding opportunities for minority-owned businesses working with state government is a crucial way that we can expand economic opportunity for people of color, and I am glad to see the Baker-Polito Administration take further steps to advance that goal.\u201d  Segun Idowu, executive director of the Black Economic Council of Massachusetts, said Baker\u2019s announcement was \u201call the things that we called for. The governor has literally done everything that we presented and requested that his office make happen in order to make some kind of headway on this issue.\u201dIn September, Idowu had demanded a meeting with Baker in response to the GBH News series and outlined many of the reforms included in Baker\u2019s announcement.But Idowu pointed out that Baker\u2019s new plan \u201cis roughly the beginning of making important updates.\u201d The legislature will still need to approve creation of the new agency, and other provisions will take time to implement.\u201cWe're happy that that the governor moved forward with all of this,\u201d Idowu said. \u201cBut, you know \u2026 what matters are results. And so that's the next step, is making sure that this actually amounts to something positive for our communities.\u201d ",

        "body": "In an attempt to make the publicly released COVID-19 data more useful, the Department of Public Health has reorganized the daily \"dashboard\" that reports on new cases, testing and other metrics, and the department on Monday will begin reporting on case growth by age group and the impact of university testing on broader state trends, Health and Human Services Secretary Marylou Sudders said.Sudders said the new daily report will also allow researchers and members of the public view trend lines that go back to March and also for the past six weeks.\"As our understanding of the pandemic in the state has evolved, certain data metrics become more useful and other metrics less so when seeking to understand the current impact of COVID on our state,\" Sudders said at a State House press conference with Gov. Charlie Baker.The separating out of COVID-19 case growth by age coincides with recent warnings from the administration that spread among people under 30 has become more prevalent that among those over 60, which is a reverse from the early days of the pandemic.Baker announced a new set of curfews and gathering size limits on Monday in an attempt to reduce the frequency of parties and private social events that the administration has blamed for the uptick in cases since the weather forced more people indoors.\"As we've seen, people testing positive for COVID is a much younger population compared to April,\" Sudders said.The new daily reports are now expected to be published by 5 p.m. every day, which is an hour later than they are usually posted online. The weekly public health report, which includes information on community level virus spread and the origin of COVID-19 clusters, will also be reformatted, Sudders said, but the raw data will continue to be available.

        "body": "Violence by right-wing militia groups did not materialize on Election Day anywhere in the country, as some experts feared, but they say the threat has not yet evaporated, as President Donald Trump continues to make unfounded allegations that Democrats are trying to \"steal\" the election.As vote counting continued Wednesday, former Vice President Joe Biden saw his lead widen in key swing states. Chatter on militia message boards \u2014 warnings on which experts take seriously \u2014 turned into claims of fraud and threats of violence.On the membership only site \"My Militia\" there are dark hints of violence.  \"We lost the vote through chicanery and fraud and I fear the worst may be yet to come,\" writes one self-described militiaman, whose whereabouts cannot be known.  \"Harden your hearts and your bodies brothers and sisters, but pray it doesn't come to that and the Republic can be saved.\"  Another writes: \"I'm ready to take action right now or in a moment's notice.  We should all be ready.\" While none are believed to pose significant risks, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island are home to nearly a dozen armed right-wing militia groups, according to a survey by the GBH News Center for Investigative reporting. And even in New England, where these groups' ranks are comparatively thin, experts have concluded that they do pose a threat of potential violence. In other states, the threat is higher. Last week, the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) and MilitiaWatch concluded that Oregon, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin are at high risk for increased militia activity following the election. In Michigan, members of an armed militia group were arrested by federal agents who alleged they were planning to overthrow, kidnap and possibly murder the governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer. Last summer, some of the same militiamen entered the state capital in Lansing and demanded an end to lockdown measures while brandishing semi-automatic weapons. The Southern Poverty Law Center connected leaders of the group to the far-right Boogoloo Movement.ACLED concluded that New England was at low risk of violence from armed militias. But there have been some tense interactions. Over the summer, armed white men in camouflage stood by with automatic weapons as a stream of multi-racial Black Lives Matter protestors passed through downtown Concord, N.H. The event ended without conflict.According to a self-reporting survey, there are eight armed militias in Massachusetts, three in New Hampshire and one each in Rhode Island and Maine. In Massachusetts, they are recruiting under names that include the 508 Militia, the 1st New England Militia and the Maine Patriot Militia. The Anti-Defamation League of New England has been monitoring militia activity in New England for a long time. Regional Director and Vice President Robert Trestan said: \u201cIt is certainly possible that, depending upon the results of the election and other contingencies, that volatile individuals associated with the militia movement might plot or attempt some act of violence in the days, weeks, or months ahead, but it is not really possible to quantify the risk, given how dependent it would be on unknown outcomes and developments.\u201dIn the My Militia discussion sites, armed men and women are warning ominously of violence in the post-election period to head off a \u201ccoup.\u201d One member wrote, \u201cWe are NOT going to let this nation succumb to blackmail or an Obama 'color revolution'.\u201d There is an overwhelming belief expressed on these sites that the Black Lives Matter and antifa movements are intricately attached and together are poised in some organized way to invade white, suburban and rural communities. Jessica Stern, a professor at Boston University\u2019s Pardee School of Global Studies and an expert on counterterrorism, said she does not believe militia groups in New England pose much of a threat.  Before Tuesday's election, she told GBH News that there was no credible threat at the polls. As far as the threat of disruptions in the post-election period, she said, \"I have a lot of confidence in the Boston FBI.\"    A spokesperson for the Boston FBI told GBH News they would not comment on any concerns specifically about militia groups. \u201cThe FBI does not track and monitor groups. Our focus is not on speech or membership in particular groups, but on individuals who commit violence and other criminal acts. We do not police ideology.\u201dArie Perliger, a professor in the School of Criminology and Justice Studies at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, said concern about militia-inspired unrest is warranted in other parts of the country, but she said, \u201cI'm skeptical if we see any substantial activity by these groups here.\u201d Perliger is author of a new book titled \u201cAmerican Zealots: Inside Right-Wing Domestic Terrorism.\u201d He said not all militia groups are as dangerous as they would like to you to believe when they dress up in camouflage. He says the public has to differentiate \u201cmilitias with actual military capabilities, and militias which are mainly social associations with limited training or visibility.\u201d The latter, some conclude, make up the bulk of so-called militias in this area. That does not mean that Massachusetts is safe from extremists. \u201cThere is \u2026 substantial far-right violence in Massachusetts, mainly in suburban areas and Western Mass,\u201d said Perliger. \u201cHowever, such incidents are mostly not part of some organized violent campaigns.\u201dAnd the threat has not passed, particularly as Trump announces preparations to contest the election results.",

        "body": "A Nevada judge has rejected a lawsuit by President Trump's reelection campaign and state Republican officials seeking to halt mail-in ballot counting in Clark County.The county, home to Las Vegas, is by far the state's most populous. About 70% of Nevada's voters live in the county, which is \"heavily Democratic,\" CNN reports.In the lawsuit, Trump's campaign and the Nevada GOP alleged that they could not observe all aspects of the ballot-counting process closely enough, and wanted to install cameras to record the process.Carson City District Court Judge James Wilson denied their request, ruling that the plaintiffs lacked legal standing to bring the case and had failed to provide evidence of \"debasement or dilution of a citizen's vote.\"The ruling was released on Monday, just a day before Election Day.Wilson wrote that there was no evidence of improper vote counting.\"There is no evidence that any vote that should lawfully be counted has or will not be counted. There is no evidence that any vote that lawfully should not be counted has or will be counted. There is no evidence that any election worker did anything outside of the law, policy, or procedures,\" he stated.The lawsuit requested the court mandate that Clark County Registrar of Voters Joseph Gloria stop using Agilis, an electronic ballot-sorting system. But the plaintiffs failed to show any error or flaw in the Agilis results or any other reason for such a mandate, Wilson wrote.The judge also pointed to state legislation passed in August that specifically authorizes county officials to process and count ballots by electronic means.The GOP lawsuit was filed on Oct. 23, just 11 days before the general election.Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford cheered Monday's ruling.\"The president's deliberate attempts to undermine Nevada's elections have failed yet again,\" Ford said in a statement. \"Today's ruling makes clear that there is a proper procedure to observe an election that even the president must follow, and it's most certainly a victory for the constitutional rights of all Nevadans.\"\"There is only one 'result,' and that comes after every lawful vote is counted,\" Ford tweeted. \"So, keep counting, Clark.\"Nevada's Republican Party did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment. State GOP chair Michael McDonald told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that the party may file an expedited appeal to the state Supreme Court.The lawsuit had also asked for an immediate halt to counting and verification of mail ballots, but Wilson rejected that request shortly after the suit was filed last month.Nevada Deputy Solicitor General Gregory Zunino argued in opening statements last week that the lawsuit was clearly partisan in nature.\"Clark County is a blue county, and this is a numbers game. And quite frankly they would like to exclude as many ballots in Clark County as they can. They want a high rejection rate,\" Zunino said, according to the Review-Journal. \"They are not challenging the process in Elko County or Humboldt County or Carson City because those are red counties.\"Nevada's Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske, a Republican, told legislators earlier this year that there were no cases of fraud during the state's primary election in June, which was conducted almost entirely by mail.

        "body": "Phil Brach spent the weekend putting huge sheets of plywood up over the massive glass windows of the store where he works, Rodman's Food and Drug in Washington, D.C., in preparation for Election Day.\"We'll probably go up two or three boards high,\" Brach says. Across the country, there are growing concerns that the bitterness and animosity over the presidential election will not end when the polls close Tuesday night. From coast to coast, cities are preparing for possible protests, civil unrest and violence, regardless of the election's outcome.Brach is working alongside his boss, Nolan Rodman, the third generation of his family to run the store that his grandfather first opened in 1955 as a pharmacy. It now includes a caf\u00e9, produce, beer, wine and food items from around the world. On May 31, Nolan says he was caught unprepared when rioters broke in and looted his business during the height of the protests over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis that sparked protests nationwide.\"They threw a chair through our window, there was chaos happening everywhere,\" Nolan says. \"I was very scared that night. It was pretty horrifying.\"After Rodman's was ransacked, Nolan says he couldn't sleep for a week. This time around they have a planNolan says he went to the store the night of the looting along with a police officer who advised him to leave. Security cameras caught mostly young men going into the pharmacy and the beer and wine section of the store. He and his father Roy Rodman even stayed in the store a few nights. Roy says this time around they have a plan.\"We put some film on these windows so that they're not easily broken, if they're smashed, they'll stay in place. And we're hoping that no one can break into the store, at least not easily,\" Roy says. Nolan adds, \"The film makes the glass shatterproof so it doesn't just explode upon contact.\" While the nation's capital city is certain to be a focal point of post-election demonstrations, other cities are bracing for possible chaos too.The National Retail Federation has held training webinars for members on crisis prevention and de-escalating conflict and hired security consultants to help store owners prepare.Many storefront windows along Chicago's Michigan Avenue are already boarded up \u2013 as some retailers there have been looted this summer not just once, but twice.\"Coming off of the summer, seeing the looting that occurred, there's a lot of anxiety,\" says Elliott Richardson who heads the Small Business Advocacy Council in Chicago. \"There's a lot of nervousness about what might happen now, what might happen during the election.\"Richardson says it's not just the high-end retailers on the Magnificent Mile downtown that are at risk, but also the mom & pop shops on the South and the West side of Chicago who are hanging on by a thread right now because of the pandemic. Channel emotions into peaceful and productive expressions\"They cannot afford to be looted. They cannot afford destruction, because if that happens, they very well may close and not reopen,\" Richardson says.Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot says the city has been planning and preparing for potential election-related protests and civil unrest for months.\"We all know that emotions will be high because they already are,\" says the mayor, \"and I urge you to channel those emotions into peaceful and productive expressions.\"Like other cities, Chicago has been running tabletop exercises and gaming out how, when and where violence might erupt. Days off for police officers are canceled and the city will flood certain areas with a highly visible police presence to deter violence. The city will also be using snow plows, dump trucks and other heavy vehicles to certain block streets and expressway exit ramps to keep demonstrators away. Superintendent David Brown says police will respect people's rights to peacefully protest and will work first and foremost to de-escalate any confrontations, but he hastens to add that his officers will take swift action against anyone intent on spreading chaos.\"The message is, don't loot in Chicago. If you do loot, you will be held accountable. If you escape, we will find you and bring you to justice,\" says Brown with a seriousness in his voice. In Beverly Hills, Calif. tensions felt high already this weekend.Workers were busy boarding up store windows while supporters of President Trump held a \"freedom rally\" that was briefly disrupted by counterprotesters.Police are planning to shut down Rodeo Drive Tuesday and Wednesday, but one small business owner who is not boarding up is Steve White, a 47-year old Army veteran who attended the rally wearing fatigues and a Kevlar vest.\"I've been buying weapons and guns ever since the first riots hit, so I'm definitely prepared for it,\" White says. He owns a business on Wilshire Avenue, \"I'm worried about it but I'm just going to camp out there every night and defend my own business.\"Groups on both sides of the political spectrum are planning election night demonstrations and the very real possibility that the outcome could be unsettled for days or weeks after Election Day could escalate tensions. Though Indiana University political science professor Ore Koren, who studies political unrest globally, says mass organized political violence is not a part of the American psyche.\"We just don't do this in this country. We have lone wolves. We can have some of rioting,\" he says \"but in terms of actual massive violence, this is not something we have done before.\"That said, 2020 is already a year of political tension and unrest unlike anything seen in the country since the 1960s and the only certainty seems to be how difficult it is to predict what may happen next.

        "body": "New Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett heard her first oral arguments at the Supreme Court Monday. Participating by phone with the other justices, a practice followed by the court since the coronavirus pandemic, she asked questions in turn in a set of cases that presented difficult procedural questions, but no headlines. The court said that she did not participate in the court's work last week after being sworn in so she would be prepared for oral arguments this week. Because of the telephone format, allowing each justice only a few minutes to ask questions, there was no way to compare her questioning with other newbies in recent years.During his first argument in 2017, Justice Neil Gorsuch asked 22 questions, a half dozen in a row, about 10 minutes into his first argument. In 2018, Justice Brett Kavanaugh was more reticent, waiting 20 minutes into his first argument before speaking. But the current pandemic format is in order of seniority, and the time for each justice is very short. Justice Barrett could well be forgiven for bowing out of the court's work last week, with just six days to prep prior to her Monday debut. But Chief Justice John Roberts also had just six days to prep in 2005, and in 1987 Justice Anthony Kennedy had even fewer \u2014  just four days. Barrett's choice to forego participating in the court's work last week meant that she did not vote in two significant cases decided by the court in opinions released Monday, opinions in each case decided by a vote of 7-to-1, with Justice Clarence Thomas dissenting in both.First Amendment Case In an important First Amendment case involving a Black Lives Matter protest, the court sided with activist DeRay Mckesson in his effort to avoid a lawsuit brought by a police officer who was severely injured by an unknown assailant.The demonstration took place on a highway in Baton Rouge, La., to protest the  shooting death of an African American man at close range by police.  The officer suffered injuries from a rock thrown by one of the protesters. Mckesson did not throw the rock, but the police officer sued on the theory that Mckesson was still  liable for damages because he negligently led the protest in a manner that caused the assault. A divided  three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the suit to go forward, ruling that a jury could plausibly find against Mckesson because \"a violent confrontation with a police officer was a foreseeable effect of negligently directing a protest\" onto the highway.The full appeals court deadlocked  on whether to review the panel's decision, and Mckesson appealed to the Supreme Court, contending that even if his role in leading the protest onto the highway was negligent, it cannot make him personally liable for the actions of an individual whose only association to him was attendance at the protest. On Monday, the Supreme Court threw out the suit for now, declaring that the Fifth Circuit's interpretation of state law \"is too uncertain a premise on which to address\" the question currently at issue. The constitutional question \u2014 namely whether such a suit violated the First Amendment guarantee of free speech \u2014 is only raised if Louisiana law in fact  permits such a suit in the first place, the court said. Acknowledging these \"exceptional circumstances,\" the high court, in essence, then asked the Louisiana Supreme Court to decide what the state law actually is \u2014 in short, whether Louisiana would permit such a suit. Eighth Amendment CaseIn a second case \u2014 involving cruel and unusual punishment of a prisoner \u2014 the justices also repudiated a Fifth Circuit's decision.This one involved a Texas state prisoner, Trent Taylor, who alleges that for six full days in 2013 he was held in what the court called \"shockingly unsanitary cells.\" The court described those conditions in detail:\"The first cell was covered nearly floor to ceiling in massive amounts of feces; all over the floor, the ceiling, the window, the walls, and even packed inside the water faucet. Fearing that his food and water would be contaminated, Taylor did not eat or drink for nearly four days. Correctional officers then moved Taylor to a second, frigidly cold cell, which was equipped with only a clogged drain in the floor to dispose of bodily wastes. Taylor held his bladder for 24 hours but he eventually (and involuntarily) relieved himself, causing the drain to overflow and raw sewage to spill across the floor. Because the cell lacked a bunk, and because Taylor was confined without clothing, he was left to sleep naked in sewage.\"After reciting these findings by the lower court, the Supreme Court noted that the Fifth Circuit \"properly held that such conditions ... violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.\" But the appeals court went on to say that the prison officers responsible for this treatment could not be sued because the  law \"wasn't clearly established\" that \"prisoners \"couldn't be housed in cells teaming with human waste,\" \"for only six days.\" Thus, the Fifth Circuit granted the officers qualified immunity from being sued. That was too much for seven Supreme Court justices. \"Confronted with the particularly egregious facts of this case, any reasonably officer should have realized that Taylor's  conditions of confinement offended the Constitution,\" they wrote.

        "body": "James Cook of Rockport, Maine, is a progressive voter who said he wants to see four-term incumbent Republican Sen. Susan Collins removed from the U.S. Senate. But the 49-year-old activist and sociology professor is not voting for Collins' top competitor, Sara Gideon, as his No. 1 choice. That\u2019s because, Cook says, his state\u2019s election system, ranked-choice voting, allows him to vote his conscience. He gave his No. 1 vote to his favorite candidate, independent Lisa Savage, and chose Gideon as his second choice. If Savage loses and neither Collins nor Gideon get a majority, his vote will go to Gideon. \u201cThis allows me to have my cake and eat it, too,\u2019\u2019 Cook told GBH News on Monday. \u201cI can make sure that I have a vote that goes to Sara Gideon, but I can also let her know that I'd like her to change her direction of policies a little bit.\u201dIn 2016, Maine became the first state in the union to approve ranked-choice voting at the state level. A similar initiative is on the Massachusetts ballot, as Question 2. Left-leaning Mainers hope the voting initiative will help Gideon give Democrats control of the U.S. Senate. The competitive race has gained attention and millions of dollars from donors across the United States \u2014 including Massachusetts \u2014 making it the most expensive race in Maine\u2019s history. Recent polls, including one from Colby College, finds the candidates running neck and neck. It\u2019s likely a decision won\u2019t be available soon. Amy Fried, a political science professor at the University of Maine, says if neither Senate candidate wins a majority, it could take a week or longer for all votes to be tallied. There\u2019s also a possibility that if Collins loses, the Republican Party could file a lawsuit to fight the process. Other lawsuits, however, have not been successful. Lyn Donovan of the seaside town of Camden says she too voted for Savage as her top choice, with Gideon as her second. \"I think if we have any hope at all of dumping Susan Collins, she's the one who's going to carry it,\u2019\u2019 she said about Gideon.Donovan said she\u2019s not happy about the out-of-state monies heading into Maine \u2014 even if much of the money is supporting her candidate. \u201cIt speaks to a national agenda, not a state agenda. And I think our senators and representatives need to be in Congress truly representing the needs of the state,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cI think it is just wrong.\u2019\u2019Political activist Karin Leuthy says she doesn\u2019t begrudge the money coming in from out of state. But in the end, only Mainers can vote.Leuthy is founder of the nonprofit volunteer group Suit Up Maine, a left-leaning group founded in 2016 to raise awareness and promote what she calls progressive ideals. On Monday, Leuthy headed out to knock on more doors. \u201cWe have our hands full,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cThe balance of the Senate could very well hinge on Maine.\u201d ",

They also said they will pursue repayment plans and seek mediation as first steps before turning to formal eviction proceedings.Massachusetts leaders implemented a moratorium on most non-emergency evictions and foreclosures for the first six-plus months of the pandemic, but Gov. Charlie Baker allowed it to expire in October as he unveiled a $171 million plan that allocates more funding for rental assistance and streamlines applications.Despite that effort, many housing justice advocates have warned that a flood of evictions is already starting, which could push Bay State renters into crowded living conditions while the virus remains a threat or onto the street.\"With this pledge, we reaffirm our ongoing commitment to support tenants and to ensure owners don't have to resort to eviction of those who are not able to pay their rent because of financial hardship due to COVID-19,\" GBREB CEO Greg Vasil said in a press release. \"We stand with our members who have been working with their residents in good faith and have taken this pledge to continue to maintain housing stability across Massachusetts throughout the pandemic.\"As of Monday, at least 10 companies signed onto the board's housing stability pledge, according to a press release: Chestnut Hill Realty, Avalon Communities Inc., National Development, Windsor Property Management, Winn Residential, Equity Management Realty, Wingate Management, Schochet Companies, Peabody Properties Inc., and Corcoran Management Company.Collectively, they own thousands of apartment units in Massachusetts and more than 300,000 nationally, according to a GBREB spokesperson.

        "body": "It's expected that former Vice President Joe Biden will have no trouble winning Massachusetts in Tuesday's election. A Republican presidential nominee hasn't carried the state since Ronald Reagan in 1984. Things tend to be tighter to our north, in New Hampshire. GBH All Things Considered host Arun Rath spoke with reporter Edgar B. Herwick III, who's been in the Granite State. This transcript has been edited for clarity.Arun Rath: Hillary Clinton won New Hampshire in a very tight race in 2016 there. Polls show that it's tight again this year, right? Edgar B. Herwick III: Yeah, that's right. So I'm currently in Manchester, New Hampshire, and Manchester is in Hillsborough County. Trump won Hillsborough County by less than 500 votes in 2016. I've been here for a few days now. I've done a lot of driving and walking around the Manchester area, and I would say anecdotally that it appears like it will be close here again tomorrow. There are a lot of the sort of signs that either campaign might distribute, but also handmade signs both for Trump and for Biden, pretty common all over the place. Trump was in this area a little over a week ago and had a rally on the Londonderry-Manchester border. I attended that. That was not this past Sunday, but the Sunday before. As Trump supporters will say, there was a lot of enthusiasm on the ground at that rally. There were thousands of people. You know, it happened on a Sunday at 1 p.m., and the closest way I could describe it is that it felt like a tailgate before a football game. There were a lot of people, there was a lot of enthusiasm. Now, Biden is ahead in the polls here, but the Trump campaign does believe that this state and its four electoral votes are still in play. We know that in a close election like this one appears to be, four electoral votes could really make a difference. Rath: Absentee voting has been expanded all across the country, that's a big storyline this year. Is that the case in New Hampshire? Are a lot of people voting by mail?Herwick: Yeah. A lot of people have. All told, they've had roughly 180,000 absentee ballots, as they call them here, which have been returned. And actually this morning, I was at a polling location in Londonderry \u2014 in fact, the only polling location in Londonderry \u2014 the Londonderry High School Gym. Now, why I was there today ahead of Election Day is that they were actually doing what they call pre-processing the mail-in ballots that they have just received, which was about 5,000 ballots. Now, the pre-processing consists of basically taking the ballots out of outer envelope and inspecting the inner envelope, which needs to have a signature on it, for example. So I spoke with Londonderry Town Manager Jonathan Kipp, who was there overseeing the pre-processing. \"It speeds up the process for us, because of the overwhelming number of absentees.\" said Kipp. \"But another benefit of it is when we identify a ballot that has to be rejected \u2014 for example, they forgot to sign the inner envelope \u2014 it gives us an opportunity to contact a voter and allow them time to remedy it.\"Kipp told me that this was happening, that they had contacted a number of voters who either hadn't signed their inner envelope or there was no inner envelope. And he said at least one voter, they had gotten a hold of that person had come down and \"cured\" their ballot. Curing your ballot basically means just making it right ahead of Election Day. It's really important to note this sort of pre-processing. This is something that's happening here in New Hampshire. It's also happening in Massachusetts on a town by town basis. Towns in both Massachusetts and New Hampshire this year have been allowed to choose to pre-process these ballots. But this is not universal across the 50 states. So, you heard Kipp say it speeds up the process for us. Now, none of those ballots are being cast today, but they are being prepared to be cast tomorrow. Tomorrow, they'll actually remove the ballots from the inner envelope and feed them into machines. Of course, all of that takes time. The pre-processing not only allows them to give voters an opportunity to cure votes, but it puts them in a position to be able to count votes faster tomorrow. Now, other four states, including crucial states in this election, like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2014 by their state laws, they're not allowed to pre-process any of their ballots until tomorrow. So this is one of the main reasons why a lot of people are expecting we're not necessarily going to have results tomorrow night, because that pre-processing can't even begin to take place in a number of states until tomorrow. Rath: It's not just the White House, but control of the Senate that's at stake. New Hampshire is one of the places where it's actually an incumbent Democrat, Jeanne Shaheen, who is on the ballot there. She's being challenged by a Republican, Corky Messner. Is that race close? Herwick: The polls suggest that Shaheen is ahead, and ahead by a wider margin than it appears in the polls that Biden is ahead. But her campaign folks, of course, told me they're taking absolutely nothing for granted. There was a mini-rally with Jeanne Shaheen and a number of the other Democrats on the ballot here in New Hampshire who gathered out at a Democrat field office. There were about a hundred volunteers. These are the folks who are going to be making phone calls, sending texts, knocking on doors tonight and through the day tomorrow to try to get the vote out. Shaheen adressed the crowd. \"Are you cold?\" said Shaheen? \"Are you ready to go? Are you ready to win? Are you ready to get the vote out? With your help, we will be successful. Don't let anybody tell you different. Get everybody out to vote, because if everybody votes and every vote is counted, we are going to win. Make sure all your friends and your neighbors and your family and everybody in your social networks know what's at stake. Together we will be successful. Thank you all very much.\"I should also mention that New Hampshire's other senator, who is a Democrat, Maggie Hassin, was also at this mini-rally, and she was really underscoring the importance of the efforts tonight and tomorrow to get out every vote. Hassan won her seat in 2016 by just 716 votes out of more than 700,000 that were cast, so that was an incredibly close race that put her in the U.S. Senate, so she was really underscoring the fact that these volunteers should not take any votes for granted. Rath: You mentioned that Shaheen is up by a margin bigger than Biden has over over Trump. Is there any sense that Shaheen could help Biden in New Hampshire? Herwick: Her campaign folks were very clear to me that they are not taking a single vote for granted. The polls are the polls, but they have work to do. But, yeah, they did say that there maybe is sort of coattails in the opposite direction effect that could be happening here, which is to say folks who are motivated to to vote for Jeanne Shaheen, they certainly do hope that might give Joe Biden a lift in what appears to be a close race. Rath: Give us a quick sketch of tomorrow. Will they start the second stage of processing those mail-ins right away? Herwick: Yes. Tomorrow the polls will be open as usual here, and there's a few things to note about New Hampshire. So while they have set records in terms of how many absentee ballots have been cast, how many mail-in votes have been cast, it's not at the scale that we've seen in, say, Massachusetts, for example. So one thing is, they don't have any early in-person voting here in New Hampshire. But in Massachusetts, it's close to about 50 percent of registered voters who have either voted early or voted by mail heading into Election Day. Here in New Hampshire, the mail-in ballots total somewhere more like 25 or 30 percent of registered voters, so they do expect that the polls are going to be pretty busy tomorrow on Election Day. There won't have been as many votes cast as there will be in a state like, say, Massachusetts. There's another interesting thing here in New Hampshire, a little quirk. One of the things I've learned in covering this election is just how different each state is in the details of how they run their elections. Even when we're voting for president, those elections are run by 50 different states, and here in New Hampshire, voters can register to vote on Election Day and then cast a ballot. So part of the get out the vote effort tomorrow won't just be trying to get registered voters to the polls, but also trying to get folks who have yet to register, who might be motivated to go to the polls, register, and vote. Of course like we will be in Massachusetts, they're going to be processing, actually casting all of those mail-in votes at polling locations. They'll also be handling in-person votes as they normally would. It should be said, again, I just sort of mentioned, that every state does it a little differently. They also report results a little differently. This is a case where Massachusetts and New Hampshire are pretty similar, which is to say that they will be at a polling location like the one in Londonderry, they'll be processing mail-in votes, they'll be handling actual voters, but until both of those things are done, they won't tally up the total and release results.So when you get results in New Hampshire and when you get results in Massachusetts, through the evening tomorrow, those results will be a mix of the absentee ballots that have been counted and the in-person votes which have been put out. In some of the other states, you have to be careful as results are coming out to be aware of which of those votes have come out, because in some states, they'll release the mail-in totals first and then election results later, or vice versa. So it's going to be a long election night for all of us, I suspect, but it should be an exciting one, as well. ",

        "body": "Some Boston business owners, concerned that election-related protests or celebrations could get out of hand this week, are boarding up their store fronts along Newbury and Boylston Streets.Raj Dhanda has owned Neena's Lighting, a high-end lighting fixture showroom on Boylston Street, for 20 years. Dhanda said Boston Police told him that extra police will be on hand in Back Bay after the election, but after suffering property damage following the protests against police brutality that swept the city on May 31, he said he is considering boarding up his storefront and other business properties he owns in Boston.\u201cI am concerned, as any businessperson on those streets would be concerned, but the question is: Do I really need to go that far, or could I trust police to manage the crowds a little bit better?\u201d Dhanda said. Lou Falzarano, owner of Boston Board Up, said he has boarded up over a dozen businesses with plywood over the last three weeks. He added that he's getting several calls an hour from other businesses.\u201cThey\u2019re asking us to cover the windows or build temporary walls in front of the glass panels to hopefully reduce any damages that might take place,\u201d Falzarano said. Falzarano is a licensed builder who began his business 20 years ago. Typically, he said, they work with homeowners who have suffered a fire and broken glass. He said he has received a high call volume seeking his services in the days leading up to the election, but he wishes the work wasn\u2019t necessary.\u201cKind of saddens us to have to do stuff like this. Some people say it is good for business and it might be good for the bottom line, but it's not really good for business to be doing this type of stuff.\u201dThe Boston Police Department said it plans on having \"appropriate resources\" on-hand and will monitor developments.",

        "body": "U.S. District Judge Gary Feinerman in Chicago, Ill., rejected a rule Monday implemented by the Trump administration that aimed to deny green cards to immigrants utilizing food stamps and other public benefits. The decision applies nationwide, not just in the state of Illinois.The Illinois Coalition of Immigrant and Refugee Rights, as well as Cook County, filed suit in September 2019 in hopes of blocking the rule, but the rule was placed into effect last January by the U.S. Supreme Court. However, Feinerman said the rule violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which governs the process that federal agencies use to develop and issue regulations, the Associated Press reported.The policy attempted to deny an immigrant's green card application if they were found to be accessing programs such as food stamps or other health or housing benefits, according to court documents. Those applicants would have been considered a public charge under the Trump Administration's new rule.The ICIRR and Cook County argued that the term public charge, an individual deemed a burden or dependent on the country, is ambiguous and requires \"a degree of dependence\" beyond temporary assistance, court documents said.The Trump Administration claimed the rule would filter out applicants unable to remain self-sufficient while in the United States. Immigrant rights advocates believe the rule forced individuals to choose between their health and an opportunity to stay in the country. Cook County also argued that the rule led to immigrants relying on expensive emergency care over preventative care, the Associated Press reported.\"As we all continue to be impacted by COVID-19, it is vital that no one is fearful of accessing health care,\" Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle said in a statement. \"The court's decision to block enforcement of the Public Charge Rule re-opens doors for immigrants to access vital services like health care.\"  Copyright 2020 NPR.

It's impossible to not become transfixed by Daniil Trifonov's fingers as he brilliantly interprets Chopin or the mesmerizing strings of Ballak\u00e9 Sissoko and Vincent Segal. Tasha Cobbs Leonard turned the Desk into a pulpit and triggered a few tear ducts, while the psychedelic sounds of Buscabulla on a beach in Puerto Rico might help you alleviate stress.

        "body": "You're probably anxious about the results, but patience may truly be a virtue on election night.Followers of NPR's elections coverage should have read or heard this at least a few times by now: We may not know who wins the presidential election (or any number of other down-ballot races) on Tuesday night or early Wednesday, and that's OK.State results are not final on election night; instead, organizations like The Associated Press \u2014 which NPR relies on for race calls \u2014 determine most winners well before local officials tabulate all votes.But this year we're expecting slower counts, and the reason is straightforward: In response to the coronavirus pandemic, many states modified their voting rules, broadening access to mail-in voting, and accelerating what had already been a rising mail-in voting trend.And mailed-in ballots \u2014 with envelopes to open and signatures to check \u2014 simply take longer to tabulate than in-person votes.Some individual state rules play key roles too. Take two swing-state examples: Florida allows counties to process ballots well ahead of Election Day, while officials in Pennsylvania have to wait until the morning of Election Day to begin that work.And with far more voters opting for mail-in or drop-off ballots this year, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf has conceded: \"We probably won't know results on election night.\"Similarly restrictive rules on ballot processing are in place in Wisconsin and Michigan as well. And of course these states may play a crucial role in deciding who wins the presidency. In fact, likely slow-counting Pennsylvania is considered by forecasters the most likely state to put Democratic nominee Joe Biden or President Trump over the election-capturing 270-electoral-vote threshold.Now add in another element: Poll after poll has shown that Democratic voters said they were far more likely than Republicans this election to use mail-in ballots. GOP voters' preference for in-person voting is likely due at least in part to Trump's unfounded claims of widespread fraud associated with mail-in ballots.And remember those different state rules about counting mail ballots. A clear partisan divide over voting method means that states that release their mail-in votes first will likely appear favorable \u2014 at least initially \u2014 for the Democrat Biden, and states that count in-person ballots first will likely appear better for Trump.This may not be a small shift, either.An analysis by FiveThirtyEight estimates that Pennsylvania could see a 21-point shift in the overall margin, from 3 a.m. ET Wednesday to the final result.Understanding these potentially misleading shifts may give you a better grasp on election night, as it unfolds. With that out of the way, let's look hour-by-hour:What Final Polls Close At 7 p.m. ETGeorgia (16 electoral votes)Indiana (11)Kentucky (8)South Carolina (9)Vermont (3)Virginia (13)Top states/races to watch: Georgia highlights the first batch of states. It's a presidential toss-up, and it has not one but two contested U.S. Senate races. Georgia has already begun processing its mail-in ballots, which should expedite results and give us an early glimpse about the course of the evening.But \u2014 now talk about patience \u2014 both Senate contests could go to January runoffs if no candidate gets a majority of a race's vote. The Senate balance of power could indeed be decided in 2021.Also keep an eye on South Carolina, where Republican incumbent Sen. Lindsey Graham is in a tight contest with Democrat and record-fundraiser Jaime Harrison.Toss-up House seats: open Indiana 5th District, open Virginia 5th DistrictWhat Final Polls Close At 7:30 p.m. ETNorth Carolina (15)Ohio (18)West Virginia (5)Top states/races to watch: Hello, North Carolina. The state will likely have tight races for president, U.S. Senate and governor. Democrats hold narrow leads in the polling averages for all three contests, giving the party one of its prime opportunities to flip a Senate seat \u2014 in addition to potentially giving Biden a big boost. The state is also likely to count relatively quickly, with most results \u2014 advance votes \u2014 expected shortly after polls close on election night.Ohio is a presidential toss-up state as well, it's thought to be a safer bet than some others to stay in Trump's column.Toss-up House seat: Ohio 1st District, with Republican incumbent Steve ChabotWhat Final Polls Close At 8 p.m. ETAlabama (9)Connecticut (7)District of Columbia (3)Delaware (3)Florida (29)Illinois (20)Massachusetts (11)Maryland (10)Maine (4)Missouri (10)Mississippi (6)New Hampshire (4)New Jersey (14)Oklahoma (7)Pennsylvania (20)Rhode Island (4)Tennessee (11)Top states/races to watch: Now we're really into the heart of the night.Pennsylvania, as we detailed above, is key for the presidential race but likely slow to count. So Florida will be the most important state here. Most of the state's polls actually close at 7 p.m. ET, and all early votes and mail ballots tabulated in advance are supposed to be released starting around 7:30 p.m. But remember those advance votes may not be where the race ultimately ends up.Maine is also notable for two reasons. One, it doles out two of its four electoral votes by congressional district, and the northern 2nd district is competitive. And two, the state has a toss-up Senate race, as Republican Sen. Susan Collins faces a tough reelection challenge. Ranked-choice voting could determine the winner.Alabama's Senate seat is also one to watch, as Republicans are expected to oust Democratic Sen. Doug Jones in the conservative state.Toss-up House seats: Illinois 13th District, with Republican incumbent Rodney Davis;Missouri 2nd District, with Republican incumbent Ann Wagner;New Jersey 2nd District, with Republican incumbent Jeff Van Drew;Oklahoma 5th District, with Democratic incumbent Kendra Horn;Pennsylvania 10th District, with Republican incumbent Scott Perry.What Final Polls Close At 8:30 p.m. ETArkansas (6)Toss-up House seat: 2nd District, with Republican incumbent French HillWhat Final Polls Close At 9 p.m. ETArizona (11)Colorado (9)Kansas (6)Louisiana (8)Michigan (16)Minnesota (10)North Dakota (3)Nebraska (5)New Mexico (5)New York (29)South Dakota (3)Texas (38)Wisconsin (10)Wyoming (3)Top states/races to watch: Fourteen states \u2014 accounting for the majority of electoral votes \u2014 have final polls close at 9 p.m. ET. Five of those states are considered competitive in the presidential race, along with Nebraska's 2nd congressional district.Texas, which saw record early voting, is the big presidential prize. The longtime Republican stronghold has been trending more purple, but a Biden win there would of course be a massive development. The state is expected to count relatively quickly too.Other presidential states to watch are: Arizona, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin. In Arizona, mail votes can be processed and counted well ahead of time, so that could expedite some results while, as we mentioned above, Michigan and Wisconsin have to hold off.These states also include several key Senate races, including an open seat in Kansas and competitive races in Arizona, Colorado, Michigan and Texas. Arizona and Colorado are considered two of Democrats' best pickup opportunities.Toss-up House seats: Arizona 6th District, with Republican incumbent David Schweikert;open Michigan 3rd District;Minnesota 1st District, with Republican incumbent Jim Hagedorn;Minnesota 7th District, with Democratic incumbent Collin Peterson;Nebraska 2nd District, with Republican incumbent Don Bacon;New Mexico 2nd District, with Democratic incumbent Xochitl Torres Small;open New York 2nd District;New York 11th, with Democratic incumbent Max Rose;New York 22nd District, with Democratic incumbent Anthony Brindisi;New York 24th District, with Republican incumbent John Katko;Texas 10th District, with Republican incumbent Michael McCaul;Texas 21st District; with Republican incumbent Chip Roy;open Texas 22nd DistrictWhat Final Polls Close At 10 p.m. ETIowa (6)Montana (3)Nevada (6)Utah (6)Top states/races to watch: Iowa is the main event here, with toss-up races for president, U.S. Senate and two for the U.S. House. Trump won Iowa by nearly 10 percentage points in 2016, so a loss or even slim win there for him this year could portend a tough go across the northern swing states.Nevada is also a closely contested presidential state, while the marquee matchup in Montana is for U.S. Senate, as Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock tries to knock off GOP Sen. Steve Daines in the conservative state. The race to replace Bullock for governor is also considered a toss-up.Toss-up House seats: Iowa 1st District, with Democratic incumbent Abby Finkenauer;open Iowa 2nd District;Utah 4th District, with Democratic incumbent Ben McAdamsWhat Final Polls Close At 11 p.m. / 12 a.m. / 1 a.m. ET11 p.m. ETCalifornia (55)Idaho (4)Oregon (7)Washington (12)12 a.m. ET Wednesday Hawaii (4)1 a.m. ET Alaska (3)Toss-up House seats: California 21st District, with Democratic incumbent T.J.

        "body": "Abortion opponents were among those most excited by the addition of Justice Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court in October. And they had good reason to be.As a law professor and circuit court judge, Barrett made it clear she is no fan of abortion rights. She is considered likely to vote not only to uphold restrictions on the procedure, but also, possibly, even to overturn the existing national right to abortion under the Supreme Court's landmark rulings in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey.Her first opportunity to weigh in could come soon. A Mississippi ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy \u2014 a ban that's impermissible under existing court precedents \u2014 is awaiting review by the justices, who could decide as early as this week to take up the case.That's the headline. But many people overlook other things that could flow from new U.S. jurisprudence on abortion \u2014 such as erasing the right to birth control that the court recognized in a 1965 case, Griswold v. Connecticut. During her confirmation hearings, Barrett specifically refused to say whether she felt Griswold was correctly decided.That was a flashing red warning light for Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, a legal advocacy group that argues cases on abortion and contraception. Roe, Northup says, is part of a century of jurisprudence based on the idea that the U.S. Constitution protects the liberty of individuals.\"It began with cases about how one educates one's children,\" Northup says, and includes same-sex marriage, contraception and abortion. You can't just take Roe out and not unravel the whole fabric.\"Yet from what Barrett has said and written about the Constitution, Northup says, \"it's clear she doesn't believe it protects the right to personal liberty.\"Abortion rights advocates worry that the court could go beyond overturning Roe and Casey. If those precedents are overturned, abortion decisions would return to the states. But the court could go a step further and recognize \"fetal personhood\" \u2014 the idea that a fetus is a person with full constitutional rights from the moment of fertilization. That would create a constitutional bar to abortion, among other things, meaning even the most liberal states could not allow the procedure.Personhood amendments were on the ballot in several states about a decade ago. They were rejected by voters even in conservative states like Mississippi after opponents argued that recognizing life at fertilization would outlaw not just abortion, without exceptions, but also things like in vitro fertilization and many forms of contraception, including some birth control pills, \"morning after\" pills, and intrauterine devices (IUDs) that some think could cause very early abortions by preventing a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus. (More recent scientific evidence suggests nearly all those methods actually prevent ovulation, not implantation, but courts haven't always followed the science on that.)An abortion law passed in Georgia in 2019 not only includes a ban on abortion at the point a heartbeat can be detected \u2014 often before a woman is aware she is pregnant \u2014 but also has a fetal personhood provision. Georgia is appealing a federal district court ruling that struck down the law as a violation of Roe.Proponents of these \"personhood\" provisions are cautiously optimistic. \"It looks like there will be a court more friendly to a challenge to Roe,\" says Les Riley, interim president of the Personhood Alliance, the group pushing the concept. \"But to some extent we've been down this road before.\"Previous courts since the early 1990s that were thought poised to overturn Roe did not. And even if the court were to uphold a law like the Mississippi ban it is considering now, Riley says, \"all that's saying is they agree that states can regulate or ban abortion at 15 weeks. What we want to do is have the factual reality that life begins at conception recognized in law.\"Mary Ziegler, a law professor at Florida State University who has written two books on the abortion battle, says the high court wouldn't have to recognize fetal personhood to threaten many forms of contraception.States could effectively ban contraception by arguing that some contraceptives act as abortifacients, she says. The court has already opened the door to this argument. In the 2014 Hobby Lobby case, it allowed some companies to decline to offer birth control coverage otherwise required by the Affordable Care Act to their employees. The owners of the companies that brought the suit said they believe some contraceptives are a form of abortion, and the court said the requirement violated their religious freedom. The court used a similar reasoning in a 2020 case exempting the Roman Catholic order Little Sisters of the Poor from even having to sign a paper that would officially exempt them from the ACA contraceptive mandate.Medical groups and the federal government don't consider any form of contraception approved by the Food and Drug Administration an abortion-equivalent, because the standard medical definition of the start of pregnancy is when a fertilized egg implants in the uterus, not when sperm and egg first unite. Yet the court has not always followed science on the issue.Still, Ziegler says, \"personhood has always been the endgame\" for abortion foes, not simply overturning Roe, which would let each state decide whether to outlaw abortion. \"Allowing states to leave abortion legal has never been the endgame,\" she says.Interestingly, however, Riley, of the Personhood Alliance, says that while he hopes his side will win eventually, he is not necessarily hoping that win will come from the Supreme Court.\"We think the strategy has been misguided for years,\" he says. \"Right now, five justices can overturn anything. That's not the system of government our founders had in mind.\"Rather, he says, his organization is working more at the state and local level \"to lay the groundwork of people's hearts being changed.\" Kaiser Health News is a nonprofit, editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.

        "body": "In the final stretch of a tough reelection campaign, a president who burst into public consciousness as a media sensation has returned to the warm embrace of conservative media outlets and their stars. And they have been returning the favor: giving airtime to President Trump and broadcasting his rallies, and hammering Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, his family and his allies. On Fox News' Trump-friendly The Five, Greg Gutfeld, at once mischievous and wistful, asked, \"Why don't the Republicans start preemptive impeachment on Joe Biden, in case he wins?\"On the Trump-fanatical One America Network, White House correspondent Chanel Rion mixed metaphors like a bartender concocting drinks at happy hour: \"The Biden-Harris campaign is facing down the barrel to an October surprise of nightmare proportions.\"  Or take Kristine Frazao's reporting for the Trump-sympathetic Sinclair Broadcast Group, which owns or controls more than 190 local TV stations:  \"Some GOP lawmakers say time is running out to get to the bottom of what they call corruption at the highest levels of government.\" Her report gave strong play to the concerns of Republicans on Capitol Hill who were calling for a special prosecutor to investigate Biden and his son Hunter. Left unmentioned: The 11 lawmakers are among the most extreme and marginalized Republicans in Congress, including one, Rep. Steve King of Iowa, who lost his primary and has been denounced by party leaders for racism, and another, Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., who has repeatedly promoted groundless conspiracy theories. Over the past few weeks, as many polls have shown Trump losing to Biden, many conservative outlets have recycled groundless claims about election fraud and unverified claims of unethical or illegal behavior by the Democratic nominee \u2014 claims circulated by the president's friends.  In exchange, they bask in the glow of Trump's presence, as Maria Bartiromo of the Fox Business Network did last month. \"Tell me how you felt, what you went through,\" she asked Trump as he recovered from COVID-19 in one of her two October interviews with him. \"It's amazing to me that you're back in such strong form right now. How did that happen?\" Since Sept. 1, Trump has given about 30 interviews to the media, according to a rolling tally by CBS White House correspondent Mark Knoller. A clear majority have been with Fox News and other media outfits controlled by media magnate Rupert Murdoch, an ally of the president. Former Fox News host Eric Bolling, now a host for a national show on Sinclair, has interviewed Trump eight times as president. In an interview with NPR, Bolling argued some of the president's relationship with Fox is transactional.\"I believe some of the stuff he does on Fox is almost like a thank you or a negotiable item, because when he's on Fox or here, our ratings explode, right? So we want him to come on,\" Bolling told NPR. \"In turn, he wants to be on those networks when he does his rallies.\"That coverage, Bolling said, is \"invaluable to a candidate.\"But when Trump is taken unfiltered or live, his distortions and untruths are often unchecked \u2014 or, if corrected, gently done so well after his misleading remarks. He has made grand and unsubstantiated claims about Hunter Biden. He lies in saying that vote totals are always counted by the end of the night. He makes baseless assertions that voting fraud is rampant.When Trump sees insufficient loyalty, he or his associates snark back. Last week, his spokesman trashed Fox News' respected polling unit for its findings that voters were turning against him in previously supporting states. And the spokesman did so on Fox News. Host Harris Faulkner didn't put up much of a defense. Trump has denounced Fox's Chris Wallace, perhaps its most straight-ahead news host, and tweeted twice against the network after it broadcast remarks by former President Barack Obama live, mocking him. That night, Fox News' chief political anchor, Bret Baier, reminded listeners and the president that the network had just carried Trump's rally live for the better part of an hour. And yet at a rally Monday in Fayetteville, N.C., Trump lionized a laundry list of seven Fox hosts, hailing each for the crowd. His non-Fox News interviews have been largely granted to media outlets or figures who have equally sympathetic records: Marc Thiessen, The Washington Post's most pro-Trump columnist; Debra J. Saunders, a conservative political writer for the Las Vegas Review Journal, which is owned by casino titan Sheldon Adelson, one of the Republican Party's biggest benefactors; Sinclair, which Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, boasted had agreed to give Trump better coverage in exchange for greater access. (Sinclair denies this, but has run numerous pro-Trump commentaries and pushed Trump's shaky boasts on handling the pandemic and allegations of corruption by the Bidens.)Among the others is Newsmax's Greg Kelly \u2014 a former Fox star and son of a former New York City police commissioner well known by Trump \u2014 on an outlet founded by Trump's friend Christopher Ruddy. And then there's Trump's friend and ally Rush Limbaugh.  When Trump contracted COVID-19, he couldn't stage rallies under public health rules. Columbia University historian Nicole Hemmer, who studies conservative media, noted that Limbaugh mused aloud on how he could help Trump by turning over his microphone to the president to do what he called a virtual rally. \"This, sir, is a mega-MAGA rally and we are all thrilled to be with you today, we are so glad you're doing better,\" Limbaugh said while introducing the president. Trump replied, \"Well, I want to thank you, Rush, you're a fantastic man, a friend of mine. Before I knew you as a friend, you were a supporter.\" Limbaugh almost never invites big-name guests on his show, arguing he's the expert. That conversation with Trump lasted two hours. And on a subsequent show, the top-rated radio host devoted another show to listening to Trump at an actual rally. \"It gives you a sense of how all-in both the president and Limbaugh are in the 2020 election,\" Hemmer said. It's not just Trump and Limbaugh, but the president and the conservative media.You can also see a game plan emerge for what would transpire if Trump were to lose: Conservative outlets would spend a lot of time on Trump's near-every utterance, and devote a lot of time to attacking Biden and his administration.

        "body": "Tracy Chapman didn't take long to release her masterpiece. Arriving near the end of the Reagan Era, the singer-songwriter's classic, self-titled 1988 debut opened with a purposefully strummed blast of righteous indignation called \"Talkin' Bout a Revolution\" \u2014 a song about class warfare punctuated by a clear warning that \"poor people gonna rise up / and take what's theirs.\"At the time, \"Talkin' Bout a Revolution\" could get overshadowed by the track that immediately followed it on Tracy Chapman \u2014 the Top 10 hit \"Fast Car,\" which remains one of the greatest songs ever written about working-class life \u2014 as well as the assortment of weary reflections on abuse (\"Behind the Wall\"), poverty (\"Mountains o' Things\"), crime (\"For My Lover\") and redemptive love (\"Baby Can I Hold You,\" \"For You\") sprinkled throughout the album.But \"Talkin' Bout a Revolution\" was and is a crucial tone-setter for the more nuanced character studies on Tracy Chapman: It's there to remind us up-front that the lives she's singing about matter, and that her subjects \u2014 no matter how firmly they've been held down \u2014 wield fearsome power. \"Finally, the tables are starting to turn,\" she sang; that was 32 years ago.Late Monday night, in the midst of the most momentous election of her life, Chapman gave her first TV performance since 2015, appearing on Late Night with Seth Meyers to sing \"Talkin' Bout a Revolution\" again \u2014 solo, acoustic, unadorned. She might not wait much longer for those tables to turn.  Copyright 2020 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

        "body": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had no greater friend in the White House than him. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban was the only European Union leader to endorse him for president in 2016. And Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said he admires him greatly. President Trump has counted several world leaders as his fans, many of them authoritarians, nationalists or populists. But they might have trouble keeping their relationship with the United States as friendly and their growing authoritarian tendencies unchecked if Joe Biden wins the presidency.Besides the various torn up international accords, the retreat of traditional American leadership from the global stage and the cementing of the \"America First\" doctrine, there has been perhaps no more glaring consequence of President Trump's tenure than his embrace of strongmen who largely eschewed the Western-based human rights and rules of law agenda. By figuring out relatively early how to win favor with Trump, these leaders often leveraged their close relationship with him to cement their own power at home. Some borrowed his rhetoric like decrying \"fake news\" to crack down on dissent, some appealed to his sense of pomp by throwing lavish ceremonies and others adopted his brazenly transactional approach to geopolitical dealmaking.None of these Trump \"bromances,\" whether forged for pragmatic or ideological reasons, are likely to continue with the same fervor with Biden. The 77-year-old former vice president, who has made clear his distaste for Trump's embrace of strongmen, is nevertheless the product of a traditional Democratic establishment that has also tolerated unsavory rulers, in the name of preserving U.S. strategic interests. Still, if Biden wins, we can expect that he'll seek to bring human rights and the rule of law as important pillars of a U.S. foreign policy.Over the last few weeks, our correspondents explored Trump's close relationships with some world leaders and how they might potentially change under a Biden presidency.The relationship with Russia's Vladimir PutinAs candidate, Trump made clear his admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin. And throughout his presidency \u2014 the Robert Mueller investigation and the ongoing Russian attempts to interfere with the election notwithstanding \u2014 Trump has mostly refrained from severely criticizing Putin himself. (The Trump administration and Congress have called out Russia's aggressive behavior and have imposed several rounds of sanctions on Moscow.)Case in point: the Helsinki summit in 2018 in which Trump refused to unequivocally back his own intelligence agencies' assessment that Russia had interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. Putin, Trump said, was \"extremely strong\" in his denials. Fast forward to 2020 and U.S. intelligence agencies believe Russia is still engaging in \"malign foreign influence\" \u2014 including the use of social media and propaganda \u2014 that, they say, primarily goes after Biden. (The Kremlin denies any interference in U.S. elections.) The drumbeat of interference assertions was a major reason U.S.-Russian relations never really had a chance to improve.How it might change under Biden\"I think the very fact that Biden was Obama's vice president already makes him not a friendly figure in Russia,\" says Moscow-based political analyst Masha Lipman. Biden, who repeatedly highlights the importance of preserving NATO, is likely to adopt a tougher line against Russia.The only thing that helps the Kremlin, Lipman says, is more polarization and turmoil in the United States. \"Turmoil means the United States weakened,\" she says. \"This is what the Kremlin can actually benefit from, not an improvement in relations.\"The relationship with China's Xi JinpingOn the campaign trail and throughout his presidency, Trump has railed against China but has also voiced admiration for Chinese leader Xi Jinping as he tried to secure trade deals that were beneficial to the United States. Who could forget his January tweet praising Xi over his handling of the novel coronavirus? As the virus ravaged the West, Trump changed course, using China as a punching bag and saying his relationship with the Chinese leader has since frayed. Putting aside the leaders' relationship, the two countries are probably experiencing the worst ties in years. The Trump administration has sanctioned Chinese officials, targeted Chinese tech companies, arrested alleged Chinese spies and regularly challenges the country's claims in the South China Sea.How it might change under BidenBiden regularly touts the tough line he took as vice president against Xi. Biden says he would force China to \"play by the international rules.\" He frames the issue as bringing together democracies to counter \"abusive economic practices.\" Tony Blinken, Biden's top foreign policy adviser, told NPR Biden would focus on \"our competitiveness, on revitalizing our democracy, on strengthening our alliances and partnerships, on reasserting our values. That's how you engage China from a position of strength.\" China, for its part, sees the U.S. as a declining power. In its recently revealed five-year plan, Beijing signaled that it expects more American-led tariffs on its exports and more sanctions on its tech firms but that it's also confident to meet those challenges.The relationship with Israel's Benjamin NetanyahuThe Israeli prime minister is one of Trump's closest allies. Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and moved the U.S. Embassy there \u2014 even though Palestinians seek part of the city for their future capital. He recognized Israeli claims to sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Netanyahu has touted his friendship with Trump in his campaigns. He's tweeted his support for Netanyahu and hosted him at the White House. Just a week ago, the Trump administration lifted a ban on U.S. taxpayer funding for Israeli scientific research carried out in Jewish settlements in Israeli-occupied territory. Netanyahu says \"Israel has never had a better friend.\"How it might change under BidenDanny Danon, who most recently served as Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, says Biden would also be \"good with Israel.\" Nevertheless, Biden was VP during Obama and Netanyahu's famously frosty relationship and it's hard to see the two leaders sharing as close a relationship as Trump and Netanyahu's.Mitchell Barak, a pollster in Jerusalem, says that a Biden administration would probably want to take a more even-handed approach with Israel. Under Trump, ties with the Palestinian leadership broke down. \"They're going to start to try and make it a little more even-handed or to look more even-handed. And the free lunches that we've been getting up until now \u2014 we're going to have to pay for some of those things. And then Netanyahu does not have the advantage because it's going to be more of an antagonistic relationship,\" says Barak.The relationship with India's Narendra ModiThe two leaders have had each other's backs even as they've both faced criticism for discriminating against minorities. When he was pressed to question Prime Minister Narendra Modi about anti-Muslim riots in India, Trump gave him a pass. \"And I will say that the prime minister was incredible on what he told me. He wants people to have religious freedom,\" he said during his visit to India earlier this year.How it might change under BidenA Biden-Harris administration is likely to voice stronger rhetoric on Modi's record on human rights, the environment and Kashmir. Still, India is seen as an important counterweight to China in the region and Biden will not want to upset that.\"Since the George W. Bush administration, the United States has recognized India's potential as a natural balancer to China. It's been a proponent of the U.S.-India relationship due to India's strategic location, its potential as a market,\" says Akriti Vasudeva at the Stimson Center, a think tank in Washington, D.C.The relationship with Mexico's Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador When he launched his campaign for president in 2015, Trump vilified Mexicans: \"They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\" He also repeatedly threatened tariffs on Mexican exports. But over the years, and especially as he worked to secure the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, Trump and Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador's relationship has grown closer. Critics of L\u00f3pez Obrador say that he caved in to Trump by adopting harsher policies toward Central American migrants. But analysts say the Mexican leader didn't have much choice particularly as he faced Trump's threats of tariffs and forcing Mexico to pay for a border wall.\"It would be very costly for L\u00f3pez Obrador to get in a fight with Donald Trump,\" says Carlos Bravo Regidor, a political analyst and professor at Mexico's Center for Research and Teaching in Economics.How it might change under BidenEvery president since Franklin Roosevelt has visited Mexico \u2014 except for Trump. In fact, Biden even visited then-candidate L\u00f3pez Obrador in 2012. Biden made more trips just to Guatemala in his two terms as vice president than Trump has made to all of Latin America as president, and would likely look to work with L\u00f3pez Obrador on immigration. As VP, he promoted aid to Central American countries and pressured their leaders to curb corruption.The relationship with Brazil's Jair BolsonaroIt's no surprise that \"Trump of the Tropics,\" as Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has come to be known, has a close relationship with the U.S. president. They're both brash nationalists who share similar views on the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 belittling the science, pooh-poohing the need for masks and saying the whole thing is just exaggerated. They both got COVID-19 and recovered. And they both believe shutting down the economy through lockdowns is more harmful than the virus. Bolsonaro's first international trip was to Washington and he's since visited Trump three more times, including in Mar-a-Lago.How it might change under Biden\"It would be a sort of earthquake,\" Rubens Ricupero, a former Brazilian ambassador to the U.S., says. Biden would likely pressure Bolsonaro on the erosion of human rights protections, including for Indigenous people, but it's the Brazilian leader's positions on the Amazon that would really be scrutinized. Biden wants to join forces with other counties to create a $20 billion fund for Brazil as part of an effort to press Bolsonaro to end rising deforestation. Still, Biden would need Brazil's cooperation on Venezuela and containing China, Brazil's biggest trading partner.The relationship with Turkey's Recep Tayyip ErdoganThe two leaders have had a bumpy relationship, but Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also understood the benefit of a good rapport with Trump and preying on his instincts \u2014 particularly one that has to do with Trump's anathema of having U.S. troops in the \"endless wars.\" With one phone call last year, Erdogan got Trump to move U.S. troops in Syria out of the way so that Turkish soldiers could attack Kurdish forces, forces who were U.S. allies in the fight against ISIS. Still, though Trump has called Erdogan a \"good friend,\" he also at one point threatened to \"totally destroy and obliterate\" the Turkish economy.How it might change under BidenFor one thing, it might become more predictable. Turkey might find that it has to rein in the adventurous foreign policy it enjoyed under Trump.Biden would also most likely pressure Turkey on its human rights record \u2014 particularly its jailing of journalists and other critics. Significant issues also divide Ankara and Washington, including Turkey's purchase of Russian missiles.The relationship with the Saudi crown princeBreaking with decades of U.S. tradition, Trump chose Saudi Arabia as his first international trip as president. In Riyadh, the Saudi royal family lavished Trump and his family with an extravagant ceremony. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has since been reaping the rewards. The Trump administration has barely pressured him \u2014 over the kingdom's air campaign in Yemen, which has killed thousands of civilians, or his crackdown on dissent. And following the 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Trump stood by the crown prince's side even as U.S. intelligence agencies assessed that the Saudi royal had approved the killing and as bipartisan lawmakers condemned him.How it might change under BidenThe former vice president has cast the kingdom as a \"pariah\" \u2014 making it clear Mohammed bin Salman would likely have a tougher time making inroads with a potential Biden administration. Biden has also threatened to stop selling arms to Saudi Arabia, a top buyer of U.S. weaponry.\"So there might be some cuts in terms of particular arms sales. There might be symbolic punishments. But the Biden administration is going to want a good relationship with Saudi Arabia despite the many problems,\" says Daniel Byman, a Middle East specialist at Georgetown University.The relationship with Hungary's Viktor OrbanEurope's populists, often shunned by Brussels, have found a natural ally in President Trump, who shares their disdain for migrants, the media and dissent. But it's Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, who leads the pack. He was the only European Union leader to endorse Trump in 2016. Four years and a White House visit later, Orban calls Trump a friend and predicts he will win reelection. The populist leaders of Slovenia (Melania Trump's native country) and Serbia have also endorsed the president.Previous U.S. administrations shunned Hungary, and the EU is investigating Hungary and Poland, run by another Trump-friendly government, for rule of law violations. Ivan Krastev, a political scientist who leads the Center for Liberal Strategies in Sofia, Bulgaria, says the two countries have used their alliance with Trump to make it clear \"that they have an alternative\" to Brussels.How it might change under BidenBiden mentioned Poland and Hungary when slamming Trump's foreign policy during a town hall last month, adding, \"this president embraces all the thugs in the world.\" The remark angered Hungary's government, but Orban is already casting Biden as part of the international liberal elite. \"We know well American Democratic governments' diplomacy, built on moral imperialism,\" Orban wrote in a recent essay in the pro-government newspaper Magyar Nemzet.\"He knows he has a lot to lose, so he's already positioned himself for the world without Trump,\" says Krastev, the political scientist.Lucian Kim, John Ruwitch, Emily Feng, Daniel Estrin, Lauren Frayer, Carrie Kahn, Philip Reeves, Peter Kenyon, Jackie Northam and Joanna Kakissis contributed reporting.

        "body": "Updated at 7:04 p.m.WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Voters were deciding between President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden on Tuesday, closing an epic campaign marked by rancor and fear that will influence how the U.S. confronts everything from the pandemic to race relations for years to come.The first set of polls closed, beginning to draw to an end a campaign that was reshaped by the coronavirus and marked by contentiousness. Each candidate declared the other fundamentally unfit to lead a nation grappling with COVID-19 and foundational questions of economic fairness and racial justice.The night began with predictable victories for each candidate, Trump taking Kentucky and Biden winning Vermont.Millions of voters put aside worries about the virus \u2014 and some long lines \u2014 to turn out in person, joining 102 million fellow Americans who voted days or weeks earlier, a record number that represented 73% of the total vote in the 2016 presidential election.Spirits were high \u2014 and positive \u2014 in many polling places after a long, exceptionally divisive campaign.\u201cThe most important issue is for us to set aside our personal differences that we have with each other,\u201d said Eboni Price, 29, who rode her horse Moon to her polling place in a northwest Houston neighborhood.Biden entered Election Day with multiple paths to victory, while Trump, playing catch-up in a number of battleground states, had a narrower but still feasible road to clinch 270 Electoral College votes. Control of the Senate was at stake, too: Democrats needed to net three seats if Biden captured the White House to gain control of all of Washington for the first time in a decade. The House was expected to remain under Democratic control.With the worst public health crisis in a century still fiercely present, the pandemic \u2014 and Trump\u2019s handling of it \u2014 was the inescapable focus for 2020.The president began his day on an upbeat note, predicting that he\u2019d do even better than in 2016. But during a midday visit to his campaign headquarters, he spoke in a gravelly, subdued tone.\u201cWinning is easy,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cLosing is never easy, not for me it\u2019s not.\u201dTrump left open the possibility of addressing the nation Tuesday night, even if a winner hadn't been determined. Biden had scheduled a nighttime speech from his Delaware hometown but, hours before slated to deliver it, he turned noncommittal, saying, \"If there\u2019s something to talk about tonight, I\u2019ll talk about it. If not, I\u2019ll wait till the votes are counted the next day.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m superstitious about predicting what an outcome\u2019s gonna be until it happens ... but I\u2019m hopeful,\" said Biden, who earlier had made a last-minute pitch in the critical state of Pennsylvania. \u201cIt\u2019s just so uncertain ... you can\u2019t think of an election in the recent past where so many states were up for grabs.\u201dWith the coronavirus now surging anew, voters ranked the pandemic and the economy as top concerns in the race between Trump and Biden, according to AP VoteCast, a national survey of the electorate.Voters were especially likely to call the public health crisis the nation\u2019s most important issue, with the economy following close behind. Fewer named health care, racism, law enforcement, immigration or climate changeThe survey found that Trump\u2019s leadership loomed large in voters\u2019 decision-making. Nearly two-thirds of voters said their vote was about Trump \u2014 either for him or against him.The momentum from early voting carried into Election Day, as an energized electorate produced long lines at polling sites throughout the country. Voters braved worries of the coronavirus, threats of polling place intimidation and expectations of long lines caused by changes to voting systems, but appeared undeterred as turnout appeared it would easily surpass the 139 million ballots cast four years ago.No major problems arose on Tuesday, outside the typical glitches of a presidential election: Some polling places opened late, robocalls provided false information to voters in Iowa and Michigan, and machines or software malfunctioned in some counties in the battleground states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Texas.The cybersecurity agency at the Department of Homeland Security said there were no outward signs by midday of any malicious activity.The record-setting early vote \u2014 and legal skirmishing over how it would be counted \u2014 drew unsupported allegations of fraud from Trump, who had repeatedly refused to guarantee he would honor the election\u2019s result. The hard-fought campaign left voters on both sides eager to move on, although the result might not be known for days.\u201cI believe there\u2019s a lot of division and separation,\u201d said Kelvin Hardnett, who was among more than two dozen voters who lined up more than an hour before the polling site at the Cobb County Civic Center outside Atlanta opened on Tuesday. \u201cAnd I believe that once we get past the names and the titles and the personal agendas, then you know, we can focus on some real issues.\u201dJaffe reported from Pittsburgh. Miller reported from Grand Rapids, Michigan.

        "body": "Government officials have spent the year touting Tuesday's election as potentially the \"most secure\" in the nation's history.Fewer voters are set to use the riskiest machines \u2014 electronic systems that leave no paper record \u2014 as compared to four years ago, and there is a whole-of-government approach to election security that never existed before.\"My confidence in the security of your vote has never been higher,\" said Chris Krebs, the director of the Department of Homeland Security's cybersecurity arm, in an election security video featuring a number of top national security officials released last month.But a hard truth remains: many of the same vulnerabilities exposed in Russia's attack on the 2016 election have not disappeared. In the wake of discoveries about that episode, security experts recommended the U.S. spend billions of dollars to improve systems across the nation. Congress allocated just a fraction of that.And while social media companies have worked to control influence operations and lies that spread on their platforms, the federal government has declined to regulate those changes. Experts say bad information is still spreading rapidly online \u2014 helped by many Americans users who have helped to sustain the explosion of questionable material.Now, four years removed from an election that the intelligence community and bipartisan congressional committees agree was marred by an unprecedented level of interference, the U.S. is set to conclude another round of voting on Tuesday.Here are some of the vulnerabilities that remain.The votes themselvesWhile many Americans remain worried about the possibility that a foreign adversary could manipulate vote totals, there is no evidence this has ever happened in an American election \u2014 even in 2016 when Russian attackers were able to hack into the registration databases of a number of states.Experts agree that actual votes themselves would probably be the most difficult part of an election to successfully hack. The problem has only gotten tougher. In 2016, nearly 28 million voters cast ballots that did not have a corresponding paper trail: a major cybersecurity red flag.This year, that number may be less than 10 million.Eliminating the paperless machines makes it more difficult for a cyberattack to potentially affect votes and go undetected.But some security experts such as Prof. Philip Stark of the University of California at Berkeley still aren't satisfied. Stark is frustrated that in many jurisdictions, including the entire state of Georgia, officials replaced their paperless machines with machines that print out a piece of paper that allows the voter to verify their selections before the ballot is counted.This gives the voter the ability to vote using the machine, but then also to check to make sure their vote was recorded accurately.The problem is, research suggests only a small number of voters actually check the paper the machine prints out, making it questionable at best whether an attack that changes voter selections actually would be caught by this method.\"We really need systems where, if they malfunction, they always generate public evidence that can be used to show that they malfunctioned,\" Stark says. \"And conversely, if the outcome is right, despite whatever malfunctions might have occurred, there ought to be a way for election officials to demonstrate that. \"Audit trailThe way officials can demonstrate that, Stark says, is through public auditing, a process that not every state uses. Even among the states that do some sort of audit, only a few do what are considered the \"gold standard\" of post-election audits, called risk limiting audits.Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., has proposed legislation to mandate such audits nationwide, but election reforms have gained little to no traction with the Republican-controlled Senate.\"The truth is that two decades after the Florida 2000 election debacle created a rift in the country, and four years after Russian interference in the 2016 election profoundly deepened that divide, the U.S. lacks satisfactory, uniform mechanisms for resolving questions about elections and verifying results,\" as journalist Kim Zetter wrote in Politico.The bottom line: your 2020 vote is almost certainly safe, but some security experts won't be fully satisfied until the majority of votes are hand-marked, and the auditing process is advanced and rigorous enough to validate the results.Considering the disparate nature of U.S. elections, that reality is still a ways away.Hacks that don't touch the resultsWhile actually affecting the vote totals remains difficult, other aspects of election infrastructure, like websites that post election information, are significantly more vulnerable.Many local governments haven't taken simple steps that would make it more difficult for attackers to set up fake websites to post fake results, for instance.Krebs, of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said at a briefing last week that he expects attackers to try to target election websites to either deface them, or just shut them down for a period of time. Hackers often use attacks like this to claim \"capabilities that far exceed what they're actually capable of,\" Krebs said.These are sometimes referred to as \"perception hacks,\" since they allow an adversary to sow doubt about the vote totals without ever gaining the sort of access needed to actually change them.The minds of the votersThe easiest targets for American adversaries, however, are the minds of Americans themselves. Influence in this realm can take a number of forms.Last month, thousands of American voters got an email that seemed to indicate an extremist group had access to their personal data: change your voter registration, the message commanded, and support President Trump \u2014 or else.But the email actually came from Iranian operatives, looking to sow discord, according to the U.S. government.Misinformation, specifically about voting, also continues to spread across social media. Facebook and Twitter have added labels on some material, but it's clear that isn't putting a stop to it.One analysis found that changing the font of a message or cropping an image was all it took to bypass Facebook's defenses, reported NPR's Shannon Bond last month.And Newsguard, an organization founded by former journalists that works to identify sources of misinformation online, recently found 40 Facebook pages that share false voting content to their audiences of 100,000 or more followers.Just three of the 53 posts Newsguard identified in its report had been flagged by Facebook as false. Together, the posts reached close to 23 million followers.\"It's far, far worse in terms of quantity,\" said Newsguard's founder, Steve Brill, earlier this year about misinformation online compared to 2016.The mail helpsWhile President Trump and his allies continue to question the legitimacy of mail voting, other government leaders see its expansion as a potential positive for election security.The amount of early voting that's occurred this year for example \u2014 97 million votes and counting as of Monday afternoon \u2014 decreases the effectiveness that any one cyberattack could have at a single time, whether it sought to change votes or influence voters' opinions on behalf of the candidates.\"[More early voting] stretches out the attack surface,\" Krebs said, which is beneficial to the defender, since there isn't just one day on which an attacker can target to disrupt the entire process.More broadly, the record amount of early voting indicates that 2020 will almost certainly feature record-breaking overall turnout.That degree of participation is a direct counter strike against authoritarian adversaries who may want to boast about the American public losing faith in democracy, said Maggie Toulouse Oliver, the secretary of state of New Mexico.\"If the ultimate goal is to sow enough confusion and discord to basically keep our democracy from continuing to churn forward,\" she said, \"it's failing.\"  Copyright 2020 NPR.

        "body": "The scourge of a global pandemic produced an election season like no other in the U.S., persuading record numbers of Americans to cast their ballots early, forcing states to make changes to long-established election procedures and leading to hundreds of lawsuits over how votes will be cast and which ballots will be counted.Polls began opening Tuesday as election officials warned that millions of absentee ballots could slow the tallies, perhaps for days, in some key battleground states and as President Donald Trump threatened legal action to prevent ballots from being counted after Election Day.Amid the tumult, tens of millions of Americans heeded warnings to act early, prompted by concerns over Postal Service delays and worries about the virus spreading through crowded polling places.\u201cCome hell or high water,\u201d said Kristen Clarke, executive director of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. \u201cIt feels like that has been the attitude voters have needed to make sure their voices are heard this year.\u201dAt least 98.8 million people voted before Election Day, about 71 percent of the nearly 139 million ballots cast during the 2016 presidential election, according to data collected by The Associated Press. Given that a few states, including Texas, had already exceeded their total 2016 vote count, experts were predicting record turnout this year.Problems occur every election, and Tuesday was no different. There were long lines early in the day and sporadic reports of polling places opening late and equipment issues. This was all expected given past experience, the decentralized nature of voting in the U.S. and last-minute changes due to the pandemic.Those yet to vote headed to polling places despite another spike in COVID-19 cases that has hit much of the country. Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s campaign had emphasized early voting due to the pandemic. Among those braving the polls were voters who may have wanted to vote by mail but waited too long to request a ballot or those who didn\u2019t receive their ballots in time.Others were likely persuaded by the president\u2019s rhetoric attacking mail voting or simply preferred to vote in person.\u201cI don\u2019t want to see no mailman. I like to stand here, see my own people, wait in the line and do my civil duty,\u201d said James \u201cSekou\u201d Jenkins, a 68 year-old retired carpenter and mechanic who waited about 15 minutes before polls opened in West Philadelphia and voted for Biden about an hour later.With Democrats dominating the early vote, Republicans were expected to comprise a large share of Tuesday's voting.In the months leading up to Election Day, election officials had to deal with a pandemic that has infected more than 9 million Americans and killed more than 230,000, forcing them to make systemic changes largely on the fly and mostly without federal money. Meanwhile, Trump repeatedly sought to undermine the election with unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud.He has particularly targeted the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania, after the U.S. Supreme Court allowed \u2014 at least for now \u2014 a three-day extension for receiving and counting absentee ballots. Over the weekend, Trump said that as soon as the polls close there on Tuesday, \u201cWe're going in with our lawyers.\u201dMisinformation about election procedures, concerns about confrontations at the polls and reports of mail slowdowns also clouded the run-up to Election Day.\u201cThe eyes of the American public and the world are on election officials as we administer free and fair elections during this unprecedented time,\u201d said New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver, who also is president of the National Association of Secretaries of State. \u201cRest assured, we are ready. We have coordinated with all levels of government and are in constant communication to ensure a smooth election.\u201dThe group has been working with the National Association of State Election Directors to help states hammer out plans for protecting against foreign and domestic cyberattacks, countering misinformation and strengthening an election infrastructure tested by massive early voting and pandemic precautions.Election officials across some 10,000 voting jurisdictions scrambled to purchase personal-protective equipment, find larger polling places, replace veteran poll workers who opted to sit out this year\u2019s election due to health concerns and add temporary workers to deal with the avalanche of mail ballots.Most states, even ones with broad mask mandates, stopped short of forcing voters to wear them at the polls. Instead, they urged voters to don masks while providing options for those who refused.\u201cTen thousand election officials, locals to every community in the country, have shifted on a dime and planned this election in record time and are working very hard to count every legitimate ballot,\u201d said Noah Praetz, a former election official in Illinois who has been helping election offices adapt their processes this year. \u201cThey are catching rare incidents of bad behavior, and they are ensuring the integrity of this election.\u201dLines already extended by social-distancing rules could get worse if large numbers of voters who requested a mail ballot show up at the polls after deciding they would rather vote in person.In some states, those voters will be required to cast a provisional ballot \u2014 one that ultimately will be counted if the voter is eligible and did not previously vote. But this also triggers a lengthier check-in process, leading to delays. Millions of absentee ballots were still outstanding as of Monday, including 1.3 million in Florida and 700,000 in Pennsylvania.Election officials have emphasized that while long lines are not acceptable, it does not mean there has been any sort of widespread failure. They also warned that isolated incidents of voter intimidation were possible given the level of political rancor this year, but that safeguards are in place and voters should not be concerned about casting a ballot in person.\u201cThere is a lot to be angry about and to fix after Election Day,\u201d said Wendy Weiser, director of the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cBut despite those unprecedented strains, the system was able to pull it together and accommodate this incredible surge in voting. That required a lot of ingenuity, commitment to democracy and hard work, especially by our election officials.\u201dCassidy reported from Atlanta and Izaguirre from Lindenhurst, N.Y.

        "body": "It's Election Day, and some states continue to deal with questions around how and when votes will be counted. GBH Morning Edition host Joe Mathieu spoke with Northeastern University law professor and GBH News legal analyst Daniel Medwed to update us on some of the voting rights lititgation we've seen this election season. The transcript below has been edited for clarity. Joe Mathieu: We spent a lot of time last week talking about Pennsylvania, the notorious swing state. Republicans are trying today to overturn a state court decision that would allow mail-in ballots to be received as late as this Friday as opposed to Election Day today. Has that been resolved, Daniel? Daniel Medwed: Well, fortunately, yes \u2014 for the time being, at least. Here's what happened. The state Republican Party filed multiple requests with the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn that state decision, but the Supreme Court thwarted those attempts, basically saying it was too close to the election [and] didn't want to meddle in state voting law. What's alarming about the decision, though, at least for those of us who are really concerned about protracted post-election litigation, is that three justices \u2014 Alito, Gorsuch and Thomas \u2014 hinted that they thought this lawsuit had merit [and] that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court usurped the authority of the state legislature when it pushed back the deadline for receiving mail-in ballots. And some people think that's an overture, an invitation, or at least an opening for the state Republican Party to renew its lawsuit as soon as tomorrow. The Keystone State is really key to the post-election litigation puzzle, I think. Mathieu: We talked about \"naked ballots\" last week. You mentioned that a state requires voters to submit mail-in ballots in a security sleeve. If you don't, they're naked; they don't count. We've seen estimates, Daniel, that could affect thousands of votes. What do you think of that? Medwed: Well, that's right. In another decision, the Pennsylvania state Supreme Court said that those naked ballots are invalid; they won't be tabulated. And that could, as you point out, jeopardize up to 100,000 votes. That's the estimate I've seen. Now the good news is, if there's any, the Department of State in Pennsylvania \u2014 the equivalent of our secretary of state's office here in Massachusetts, which monitors and oversees the electoral process \u2014 [has] issued some guidance, and they've said to voters, if you think that there's a deficiency with your mail-in ballot, maybe it's a naked ballot or it has some other infirmity, there are options to cure it. You can come down to your polling place today and file a provisional ballot. The problem is that's cold comfort, of course, to people who might not even know about their deficiency. And evidently, counties across Pennsylvania are taking various approaches in terms of how effective they are and aggressive they are in alerting voters about potential problems. Mathieu: I want to go to New Hampshire, Daniel, because over the past few years, as you well know, there's been a dispute surrounding the eligibility of college students to vote in New Hampshire. This comes up every two to four years. How has it been resolved? Medwed: Well, I think we have some clarity finally on it in New Hampshire. Here's how it's supposed to work. Traditionally in most states, college students are allowed to vote in the place where they're attending school as long as they're domiciled in that state \u2014 they've attained residency status. And that's how it worked in New Hampshire for many, many years. That is until 2017, when state Republicans changed the law to basically make it much harder to achieve a domicile status. That led to an avalanche of litigation, which culminated in a state court decision in April 2020, where a New Hampshire Superior Court judge ruled that those Republican efforts were unconstitutional. Even though that decision is currently up on appeal, it is the law of the Granite State. College students may vote in this election in New Hampshire if they are otherwise eligible to vote. There are, of course, many complications stemming from the coronavirus epidemic because [many] college students in New Hampshire and elsewhere are learning remotely. And that does pose a fly in the ointment. Mathieu: So how does that work for voting purposes? Remote learners are treated as living in New Hampshire, their home states or somewhere [else]? Medwed: Well, here's how it works, or at least how we think it will work. So on the one hand, seniors, juniors and sophomores who were in residence in New Hampshire during the last academic year before the spring surge and the lockdown, they're treated under New Hampshire law as temporarily displaced and they're eligible to vote. They could send in their absentee ballot or, I guess, conceivably drive up to New Hampshire today to do it in person. But on the other hand, incoming freshmen who have never actually resided in New Hampshire and are learning remotely now are ineligible to vote, even if they otherwise are over the age of 18 and so on.

        "body": "Updated at 4:15 p.m. Gov. Charlie Baker's latest nominee to the Supreme Judicial Court is an Appeals Court judge with a background in intellectual property litigation who built a robot while studying engineering at MIT.Judge Dalila Argaez Wendlandt, if confirmed to the post by the Governor's Council, would be the first Latina to serve on the state's high court.\"The daughter of immigrants from Colombia, Justice Wendlandt will bring her voice to our highest court, a voice we need now more than ever,\" Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito said at an election day press conference at the State House where she and Baker introduced Wendlandt. \"She has served as a mentor for women and girls throughout her career and the impact she would make in this new position, for young girls to see the first Latina woman serving on our highest court in the commonwealth, is profound.\"Her nomination, which comes after Baker last week tapped Associate Justice Kimberly Budd to serve as the court's next chief justice, moves the second-term Republican governor a step closer to having chosen the full SJC bench.Of the current six justices -- one seat is vacant after the death of Chief Justice Ralph Gants -- Baker has appointed five, and the sixth seat will open up when Justice Barbara Lenk retires later this year.Referencing Gants' death and another former justice's ailing spouse, Baker said some of those appointments \"involved a couple of really crummy, awful things.\"\"I take all of these nominations, every single one of them, especially as somebody who's not an attorney, really seriously because the courts really matter, and the people who sit in those chairs really matter,\" he said.Wendlandt, 51, was born in New Orleans. She graduated from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and earned a master's degree in mechanical engineering at MIT before attending Stanford University Law School.She said Tuesday that making the transition from engineering to law was \"obvious\" for her.\"Engineering requires you to look at the data and follow it where it goes, and to roll up your sleeves when there's a problem that looks like it's unsolvable,\" she said. \"For me the law is very similar especially when you do high-end legal work. Often, the answer is not clear, but if you're confident in your skills, you roll up your sleeves, you bring out the big guns and you just do your job.\"Spanish is Wendlandt's first language, and responding to a reporter's question, she said in Spanish that her parents came to America from Colombia to realize their dreams for their children, and that her late father was watching her from heaven with pride. Baker said Wendlandt was \"part of a familiar American story that sometimes gets lost in all the noise of today's politics.\" He said she has often been one of the only women and the only Latina \"in many of the rooms she's been in throughout her academic, business, legal and judicial career.\"\"She's done nothing but shine in all of them,\" he said. \"Every single one.\"Baker first appointed Wendlant to the bench in 2017, selecting her for the Appeals Court seat that opened with Justice Elspeth Cypher's elevation to the SJC.\"I would expect her expertise in science and technology would be a terrific asset to the court on more than just case law,\" he said Tuesday. \"Each branch of the government will need to deploy technology and more creative ways to meet the demands of the public in the 21st century. Her colleagues also describe her as thoughtful and kind, because she often leaves a well-timed note for someone who's run into trouble, and she bought a sewing machine to teach herself how to sew masks for health care workers when the pandemic struck.\"Before becoming a judge, Wendlandt was a partner in the intellectual property litigation group at Ropes & Gray LLP. She clerked for Judge John Walker Jr. of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit after graduating law school in 1996.The Governor's Council, which will vet Wendlandt for the SJC post, unanimously confirmed her for the Appeals Court. Councilor Eileen Duff lauded the news of Wendlandt's nomination to the high court, calling the judge \"a brilliant choice for Massachusetts.\"\"Not only does she have a wide range of legal experience, but her extensive engineering and technology background brings a depth of knowledge in an industry that will become particularly relevant to the court system in the years to come,\" Duff, a Gloucester Democrat, said in a statement. \"It is essential to have diversity on the Supreme Judicial Court and I commend Governor Baker on nominating a second woman of color to the state's most powerful bench.\"Budd, if confirmed, would become the first Black woman to serve as chief justice.In picking Wendlandt, Boston Bar Association President Martin Murphy said Baker \"made another commendable, historic nomination to Massachusetts' highest court.\"\"As demonstrated by her experience as a highly-respected litigator who argued before the US Supreme Court, and more recently on the bench, Justice Wendlandt has a brilliant, creative, and methodical legal mind,\" Murphy said. \"Her background -- which includes a master's degree in mechanical engineering, pro bono work on asylum applications and a death-row appeal, and a commitment to improving work-life balance for attorneys at her prior firm -- will bring a unique perspective to the Court and assist in their work on some of the most challenging issues in the Commonwealth.\"",

        "body": "In the final sprint of the presidential campaign, both the Biden and Trump camps set their eyes on Pennsylvania, aptly referred to as the Keystone State, a crucial contest that may determine the next president of the United States. President Trump rallied supporters Monday in Wilkes-Barre two days after holding four separate events across Pennsylvania. Vice President Pence campaigned Monday in Latrobe and in Erie, a county that swung from Obama to Trump in 2016. The Biden campaign also carpeted the state Monday in a series of stops that reflect its diversity: in Beaver County with union members, in Pittsburgh with African American community leaders and at an event for Latino voters in Lehigh Valley. Jill Biden appeared in Erie as well and attended a rural get-out-the-vote event in Lawrence County.Both campaigns have emphasized how crucial Pennsylvania is to their electoral prospects. In 2016, Trump flipped the state, winning by less than 1 percentage point. Before that year, Pennsylvania had voted for Democratic candidates in six consecutive presidential elections.Speaking Sunday in Philadelphia, Biden said: \"My message is simple, Pennsylvania is critical in this election.\"Trump told supporters in Allentown on Oct. 26, \"By the way, we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole thing.\" How did Trump flip Pennsylvania? Pennsylvania is geographically diverse, with a history of blue-collar workers in the coal and steel industries (some of whom have transitioned to working in the natural gas industry), ample farmland and a large health care sector. According to the Center for American Progress, 84% of Pennsylvania voters in 2016 were white and 54% of the state's total vote came from non-college-educated white voters. The turnout rate among these voters increased from 53% in 2012 to 57% in 2016. Trump was able to boost turnout both among white and rural voters. \"Our estimates show that if white non-college-educated turnout had remained at its 2012 level, instead of increasing significantly as it did, [Hillary] Clinton would have been able to carry the state,\" a Center for American Progress report from 2017 said. How many electoral votes? 20Are people voting by mail? Yes. Pennsylvania has no in-person early voting, but residents were able to vote by mail. According to the U.S. Elections Project, a turnout-tracking database run by University of Florida professor Michael McDonald, more than 3 million mail-in ballots were requested in the state. As of Monday, more than 2.4 million ballots have been returned, about 10 times the number of mail-in ballots used in 2016, Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar told NPR's Morning Edition on Tuesday.McDonald noted that registered Democrats in the state have a roughly 1.2 million ballot request lead over registered Republicans. More than 95 million Americans across the country have voted early. What's the state of the race? Pennsylvania, which NPR regards as a \"Lean Democratic\" state in the election, is one of the most hotly contested states this cycle. Trump appears to be more competitive in Pennsylvania than in two other swing states that he won in 2016 \u2014 Michigan and Wisconsin. While Biden had a 7-point lead in Pennsylvania three weeks ago, the race has tightened in recent days. As NPR's Domenico Montanaro reported, the narrowing of the race is something the Biden campaign was expecting in the final days of the campaign. By NPR's count, if Trump wins Georgia, Iowa, Florida, North Carolina, Arizona and Maine's 2nd Congressional District, and Biden retains the support in states that are now leaning his way, the race could become a 259-259 electoral showdown with Pennsylvania as the deciding state. This time, the fight for Pennsylvania, and the presidency, may hinge on who wins the suburbs and by how much \u2014 specifically in the southeast counties of Bucks, Delaware, Chester and Montgomery. Polls show that the president has lost support among these voters \u2014 specifically suburban women. Trump acknowledged as much during an Oct. 13 campaign stop in the southwest city of Johnstown when he said: \"Suburban women, will you please like me? Please, please.\"Trump has pushed a \"law and order\" message, hoping to peel off more support from suburban women. He's also repeated claims that Biden will decimate the state's fossil fuel industry. Biden, on the other hand, has made Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic a central issue of his campaign and has pushed the message that the Trump administration is trying to dismantle the Affordable Care Act in the middle of this crisis. He's also emphasized his Scranton roots during campaign events in the state. The Democrat was born in the state but moved with his family to Delaware as a boy.Obama has campaigned in the state as well, with a particular focus on boosting turnout among Black men. When will we know Pennsylvania's results? Pennsylvania election officials are cautioning the public that the state's full results won't likely be known on election night. Boockvar, the secretary of state, told NPR that the overwhelming number of ballots will be counted \"within a couple days.\" The state has up to 20 days to certify the election. But on Thursday, Gov. Tom Wolf put it more bluntly: \"We're sure it will take more time than it used to. We probably won't know results on election night.\"Pennsylvania Republicans had previously tried to block counting ballots arriving after Election Day. But the U.S. Supreme Court has declined to overturn the state Supreme Court's decision that election officials can count absentee ballots received as late as the Friday after Election Day so long as they are postmarked by Nov. 3.  What's the counting process like? Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are the only two swing states where election officials can only begin processing and counting absentee ballots on Election Day, which means complete results are likely to be delayed for several days. Many counties said they'll start processing ballots as soon as they're allowed: early Tuesday morning. But as NPR's Sam Gringlas reported, a handful of counties, such as Cumberland County outside Harrisburg, said they won't begin dealing with absentee ballots until Wednesday.  Copyright 2020 NPR.

        "body": "Carol Rose, executive director of the ACLU of Massachusetts, told Boston Public Radio on Tuesday the organization's team of trained independent poll monitors had already made hundreds of calls to the Election Protection hotline by midday on Nov. 3.\"A lot of [the calls] are basically just voter questions,\" said Rose. \"Things like excessively long lines, which we're seeing in Mattapan, Dorchester, Hyde Park ... There's been some improper ID checks. We've gotten some reports that it seems to be targeted at Latinx voters, so we're paying attention to that. That's been in Jamaican Plain and Lawrence.\"Rose said there have been calls related to voters who requested mail-in ballots, but then decided to show up to their polling location to cast their ballot in person, as well as calls to report people driving trucks with political flags near polling locations.\"We're nonpartisan, but we've had some reports of people in big trucks with Trump flags ... cruising past the polling places,\" she said. \"The main thing is that they have to stay at least 150 feet away from a polling place.\"Rose said monitors trained by the ACLU do just what their name implies: monitor polling locations across the state to ensure the \"voting process has integrity, and that people are being able to vote and exercise the right to the franchise.\"When they see something that might indicate some form of voter intimidation, or just have a question about the process, they call the Election Protection hotline at 1-866-OUR-VOTE. ACLU officials then determine whether the Secretary of State, local election officials, or even the police, need to be informed of the incident, said Rose.Click on the audio player above to hear the full interview.",

I just felt disconnected\u2026 I\u2019m glad that I voted, but it just wasn\u2019t the same energy as if I [had gone to the polls] in person.\u201dGray found herself missing the camraderie she had found waiting in line to vote during previous elections. And while social interaction has been scarce for many since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, Gray notices it especially keenly as an AmeriCorps Advocate for Mentoring, a job that has traditionally been all about building interpersonal relationships.Meet Elizabeth GrayBorn with both Cerebral Palsy and ADHD, Gray has a different perspective than some on her abilities: \u201cI\u2019m lucky to have had a lot of opportunities in being a difference maker,\" she said.Gray, 25, has had a wealth of experiences in activism, including internships with the State House and the MBTA, which led to her current role as an AmeriCorps Advocate working with Partners for Youth With Disabilities (PYD). In her role with PYD, Gray recruits disabled youth for the many programs offered at the organization, from theatre groups to advanced mentoring programs \u2014 a service, she thinks, that has been especially beneficial throughout the pandemic. \u201cI think that the whole pandemic has been really tough on the disabled community. Not being able to go out, not being able to be social with your friends. I feel that it\u2019s really detrimental to the progress of people of any age [and ability].\u201dGray\u2019s many roles within the disabled community have caused her confidence to flourish, she says. And it\u2019s this confidence that has led her to believe in the power of everyone's individual voice.\u201cI have my own issues with access that might be different from someone else\u2019s. To be able to tell your story and to be able to explain to the people in charge is really important\u2026 If you can say what you want, at least they know that there is somebody who would like this to change.\u201dAsk For What You NeedGray\u2019s belief in the value of individual voice and experience ties in tightly with her thoughts on the importance of voting \u2014 and while her words are directed at the disabled community, they ring true for everyone:\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to be different. And don\u2019t feel that what you\u2019re asking is wrong\u2026. You\u2019re the future, and you\u2019re able to make a change, so go out and make that change,\" she said.So, what does that future look like for Gray? And what changes would she like to see for her community?\u201cThere\u2019s an estimated 38 million registered voters that have some form of a disability,\u201d she tells me. \u201c[And] being able to get to the polls has been one of those topics that I have seen be a challenge\u2026 Having different transportation agencies and bringing people [to the polls] from different places. If we are able to voice our choice, then people should be able to get to the place where they can voice that choice.\u201dIf You Can Vote, Vote",

That's because, growing up in Cuba, she didn't have that right. \"I was born in a communist country,\" she said. \"And so, therefore, our rights were pretty much trampled on.\"In fact, Sallo was in line to vote on the very first day of early voting for this year's election. \"It's a nonpartisan issue, civic engagement, right? We all have a right to be engaged. We all should be engaged.\"Sallo served as the Chief of Staff and Senior Counsel for the U.S. Department of Justice Community Relations Service, as well as the Staff Director of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights under the Obama Administration. Previously, she also worked for UnidosUS, the nation\u2019s largest Hispanic civil rights and advocacy organization, as well as serving as a case manager, special education teacher, and child welfare attorney. She is now the Executive Director of the Disability Law Center. \"So therein lies the intersection between civil rights and disability rights,\" she said.Her team's efforts to ensure that this year's elections were accessible to all voters began nearly a year ago, when the Disability Law Center started working with state and local officials to ensure that the language used for mail-in voting met the same accessibility standards as those for voting in person. Given health and safety considerations due to the coronavorus pandemic, it became even more important to ensure that all voters could safely cast their ballots, whether at the polls or from home.\"Don't we all have the right to vote indepdendently and privately?\" she said. \"Someone with a disability should not have less of a right than someone without a disability.\" Along with ensuring that mail-in ballot procedures were ADA compliant, her team also conducted polling site visits across the Commonwealth to make sure that proper protocols, including handicap parking and signage, and equipment, including accessible AutoMARK voting machines, were in place and set up for early and Election Day voting. They also checked out ballot dropboxes, a new voting vehicle for this unprecedented election cycle.Asked if there is anything voters can do to help their disabled neighbors at the polls this year, Sallo said: \"When you pull up to your polling site, just take it all in... I think it's important just to raise that awareness.\"\"It's about empathy,\" she said. \"It's about caring for your neighbor.\"",

        "body": "Siddharth Hariharin is not registered to vote in Massachusetts \u2014 but that didn\u2019t stop the 23-year-old from taking democracy into his own hands on election day.When the recent New Jersey transplant noticed that people couldn\u2019t find the door to the polling site at Boston City Hall, he spent hours in the cold pointing would-be voters in the right direction.\u201cI want to wake up tomorrow knowing I did everything I could to help people make their choice,\u201d he said.Many voters emerged from COVID-seclusion to cast their ballot in a bitterly partisan national election. After an election season steeped with worry about the spread of the coronavirus, the economy and job-losses, as well as rising fear that the election results could be contested, some voters showed up at election sites with a fierce determination to have their say at the ballot box. Others waited dutifully in long lines that coiled around schools, libraries and other polling sites for more than 30 minutes in the cold for their chance to vote. And social media was awash in the people proudly displaying their \u201cI voted\u201d stickers on both sides of the aisle.Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin had predicted record turnout and nearly half of all registered voters in the state had already cast mail-in or absentee ballots three days before the election. Another 1.3 million are expected to vote on election day.Those are voters like Janet Meany of Back Bay. \u201cI needed to put that ballot in the box myself, to get rid of [President Donald] Trump,\u201d Meany said as she left the voting booth at the Boston Public Library on Tuesday afternoon. Casting her ballot in person allowed her to excise the \u201cstress of that idiot in the White House\u201d who mishandled the coronavirus and inhumanely separated migrant children from their parents at the border, she said.On her heels was Lisa Koch, a Trump supporter who reserved her sharpest criticism for Joe Biden\u2019s vice presidential running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris of California. Calling her \u201cinsanely narcissistic\u201d and an opportunist, Koch said that she could not stomach the thought that she would be next in line for the presidency if Biden is elected.\u201cI\u2019d much rather do it in person,\u201d she says. \u201cIt feels more satisfying.\u201dThat sense of election fervor could be felt throughout the state, even though Massachusetts is overwhelmingly blue and a world away from the battles in heavily contested states like Florida, Pennsylvania and Texas. More than 100 million Americans voted early and votes cast in person are expected to represent a significant minority of all votes nationally. 20201102_JTO_Election082.jpgIn Massachusetts, the group Lawyers for Civil Rights Boston, which trained more than 200 volunteers to watch polls and answer election questions, said voting lines were excessively long in Mattapan, Dorchester and Hyde Park with wait times in excess of 40 minutes. The group also said at one polling site in Lawrence, voters who had not received mail-in ballots were being told they could not vote.Brighton resident Evan Scorpio said he and his wife requested mail-in ballots due to their concerns about COVID-19. Their mail-in ballots never came, he said. The couple cast their votes at the Alexander Hamilton School in Brighton Tuesday, saying this election was too important to miss.\u201cLuckily, it was really quick \u2014 no line,\u201d Scorpio said.In Provincetown, across the street from Town Hall, Sean McNulty and his brother Tim, the owners of the Lobster Pot restaurant, offered free hot chowder to voters on election morning. \"We love our town. We're ready for a new beginning,\" said Tim McNulty, dressed entirely in blue and unwilling to state his voting preference outright. \"Today's voting day, and this is in the spirit of democracy and community.\"The cold temperatures also didn\u2019t stop a steady flow of voters from hitting the polls in Franklin, a town of 30,000 in the southeastern corner of the state. More than half of registered voters have cast their ballot early, but not resident Lawrence Allers.He said he wasn\u2019t concerned about whether his mail-in ballot would be counted or the recent resignation of the town clerk during the primary. \u201cWe just gotta be patient, pay attention and do the right thing,\u201d Allers said. \u201cI think we\u2019ll move on from this and get everybody back to normal and shakin\u2019 hands and having dinner together.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t clear if he was talking about the coronavirus or the presidential election. Those two issues have overshadowed other key votes, including a U.S. Senate race that pits veteran Democrat Sen. Ed Markey against a Republican challenger, attorney Kevin O'Connor.There are also two \"yes or no\" ballot questions asking voters to decide who has control over a car's wireless data and whether to adopt a ranked choice voting system.20201102_JTO_Election076.jpgInstead, voters were laser-focused on the next person to occupy the White House. Charles and Penny Garcia showed up at the polls at Stoneham Town Hall wearing matching American flag jackets.\"I'm here to vote for Trump,\" Charles Garcia said. \"I'm 64. I only voted twice in my life. Once, four years ago for Donald Trump. And again today for Donald Trump. It's all I vote for.\"He said he's supporting Trump because he says Trump is a real man, and politicians are liars. And he likened mailing his vote to putting $500 cash in the mail and sending it to yourself. In Worcester, Martin and Amanda Gjoni's were hoping to teach their four-year-old son Benny that voting is vital to democracy. They took time-off from work on Tuesday to go to the polls as a family.\"We try not to sugar coat a lot of things with him,\" said Amanda Gjoni. \"We like to let him know what's going on. We watch the news. He watches it with us. We explain it to him the best that we can. So he's not in the dark about a lot of things. He actually has a decent understanding as far as a four-year-old ...for what's going on in the world.\" Benny said he is already thinking ahead to 2024, when he hopes the ticket includes \"Spiderman.\"Back at the Boston Public Library, 19-year-old Anna Rose Read and her mother, Clair Beard Read, cast their votes. The mother and daughter contracted the coronavirus last March, and Clair Beard Read, who is a medical doctor, said her symptoms still linger. She blames Trump for not doing more to stop the virus\u2019 deadly spread.\u201cHe\u2019s so concerned with the effects of COVID on the economy, he refused to acknowledge how deadly it was,\u201d she said. Both women said they were concerned that Trump was undermining democracy by giving tax advantages to the wealthiest Americans while crafting immigration policies that punish poor children who cross the U.S. border.Staying home, she said, was simply not an option.Digital producer Meghan Smith, reporters Craig LeMoult, Carrie Saldo, Bob Seay, Marilyn Schairer, Esteban Bustillos and radio producer Amanda Beland contributed to this report.",

Larry Hogan, an ideological neighbor of Baker's, reportedly didn't fill in any of the candidates' bubbles this year, either, but wrote in the name of former President Ronald Reagan, who died in 2004.Back in April 2019, when Hogan was considering jumping into the race himself and Weld was a non-Trump option for Republican primary voters, Baker complimented both Republican governors for working across the aisle to \"find common ground and compromise.\" He said that the Hogan/Weld \"playbook\" is one that \"most people in this country appreciate and would like to see more of.\"Baker disclosed last week that he mailed in his 2020 ballot, joining the more than 1.3 million Massachusetts voters who have opted to take advantage of the 2020 vote-by-mail law.",

        "body": "Updated at 10:57 p.m. Massachusetts provided one of the few moments of certainty on a historically contentious election night as Democratic Sen. Ed Markey cruised to re-election over Republican challenger and first-time candidate Kevin O\u2019Connor. In heavily blue Massachusetts, Markey was always a favorite to win re-election to a second full term in the Senate after winning a special election in 2013 and then re-election in 2014. He had previously served in the U.S. House of Representatives for 37 years. The race was called by the Associated Press shortly after polls closed at 8pm. Former Vice President Joe Biden was also projected to win the state's 11 electoral votes. In a statement to Twitter, Markey wrote that \"voters in Massachusetts have reaffirmed the mandate of our grassroots movement. Together, we are going to fight for bold and systemic change in the United States Senate.\" \"I will fight every day to make you proud of your vote,\" Markey said during a livestreamed video statement to social media. He also reiterated his support for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, predicting a \"historic victory.\" The big question in this race was whether Markey would survive a Sept. 1 primary challenge from Rep. Joseph Kennedy III, who appeared to be the front-runner in early polls last year. Kennedy won the endorsement of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, but Markey got the endorsement of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and was a leading co-sponsor with her of the Green New Deal, a sweeping proposal for action to fight climate change.  Kennedy and Markey each raised more than $10 million for the race, and Markey ended up winning by a comfortable 55%-45% margin. That left Markey with only O\u2019Connor to beat \u2014 a little known Republican lawyer from Dover who raised less than $1 million for his campaign. ModuleSpeaking to supporters in South Boston Tuesday evening, O'Conner said, \"we put up a robust fight, I think a great fight. And I think we won the argument on the merits.\" But, he added, \"you learn in competition that sometimes the victory isn't this game, it's the next game.\"The two faced off for one debate in early October that largely revolved around who was to blame for the coronavirus pandemic and whether Amy Coney Barrett, President Trump\u2019s pick to fill Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s seat on the Supreme Court, should be confirmed. Markey tried to paint O\u2019Connor as being too aligned with the current occupant of the White House and O\u2019Connor argued that Markey is too far to the left of the mainstream Democratic Party to represent Massachusetts. In the runup to the election, both Republican and Democratic donors turned their attention elsewhere, spending millions funding Senate campaigns outside the state, a signal of how little doubt there was about the outcome here. Which party will control the Senate come January has been a major focal point of this year's election cycle with several Republican incumbents \u2014 from Maine to South Carolina to Iowa to Arizona \u2014 vulnerable to well-financed Democratic challengers.",

        "body": "The video for Dinner Party's newest single, \"Freeze Tag,\" is centered around an age-old tradition in the Black community: the cookout. Group members Terrace Martin and Robert Glasper stand by as local kids and neighbors gather to eat grilled food and share a few laughs. That's until a young boy in a crisp white t-shirt appears mid-frame with his fingers twisted into a makeshift gun. As he fires a shot, he's hit by one. The color shifts to a dramatic black and white as Martin, Glasper and company scatter. A few frames later, directors Elliott Sellers and the members of Dinner Party return to the initial scene. This time it's peaceful, a quiet night with a hopscotch grid scribbled on the concrete.The song itself is equally emotive. \"They told me put my hands up behind my head,\" vocalist Phoelix sings above the track's head-nodding drum loop. \"They told me if I move, they gon' shoot me dead.\" Here, Dinner Party flips the notion of a childhood game into a grim portrayal of police brutality in the United States. Cordae's verse unpacks the frailty of human existence: \"The funny thing about this life s*** is that we all die / Hoping for heaven although we're closer to hell / Dreams to get my brother out that cage and open his cell.\" In that way, both the video and track are political and intimate, reminding us that life can turn at a moment's notice, and that state-sanctioned violence is still an American plague.

She said many issues related to immigrants rights will be decided by the next president and that she hopes for policies that are more inclusive and less politicized.Then, we heard from Brendan Geraghty, a student at UMass Amherst, and Nicole Erickson, a student of Westfield State University. Both are working on the New Voters Project from the organization MASSPIRG. They talked about the difficulties of recruiting and registering new voters virtually and during a pandemic.Finally, with the pandemic, the election and the potential aftermath of it, we're living in stressful times. It can be overwhelming for adults, and even more so for children. We checked back in with Dr. Fatima Watt, the director of Behavioral Health Services at Boston\u2019s Franciscan Children\u2019s, about how to discuss potentially difficult and stressful situations and events with kids of all ages.Segments:Eva Milona - 2:13Brendan Geraghty and Nicole Erickson - 12:49Dr. Fatima Watt - 23:06",

And this, unique to 2020: Sanitizer on voters\u2019 hands caused a ballot scanner to jam at a polling place in Des Moines, Iowa.Minor problems like these happen during every election. But Tuesday\u2019s voting appeared largely free of any major glitches \u2014 despite being held during a deadly pandemic that has killed more than 230,000 Americans and infected more than 9 million.The FBI was investigating reports of efforts to discourage people from voting using automated calls in a few states. Such reports are common in every election.But there were no signs Tuesday of large-scale voter intimidation efforts or clashes at the polls, as some had feared, given the intensity on either side of the hotly contested race between Republican President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden.The Homeland Security Department\u2019s cybersecurity agency said earlier in the day that it had seen no apparent signs of any malicious cyberactivity, but also noted that it was too soon to declare victory.Still, some polling places opened late, and machines or the software that powers them malfunctioned in some counties in the key states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Texas.As the novel coronavirus took root in the U.S., officials repeatedly urged voters to cast their ballots early or by mail, in hopes the advance voting would ease some of the problems that materialized during the primaries, such as long lines and hours-long waits.More than 102 million voters heeded that advice, a record number that represented 73% of the total vote in the presidential election four years ago.",

        "body": "Voters in Massachusetts settled two key races early on election night as Democratic Sen. Ed Markey waltzed to re-election and the state was quickly called for former Vice President Joe Biden. None of the state\u2019s congressional races were close, and Democrats seemed assured of recapturing all nine of the state's House seats.But, the shape of the presidential race and the battle for the control of the Senate remain murky as the election officials across the country deal with the unprecedented numbers of mail-in and absentee ballots. As the early returns rolled in, both President Donald Trump and Biden racked up predictable victories in their base states. The Associated Press called Vermont for Biden and Indiana for Trump within minutes of the polls closing.At the top of each hour, AP and TV networks called another round of uncompetitive states: Nebraska for Trump, New York for Biden. As the night wore on, it became clear that the presidential race was settling into a slow, ballot-by-ballot grind in three key states: Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Trump\u2019s upset victory over Hillary Clinton in 2016 was based on his narrow victories in these three traditionally Democratic states. By midnight Tuesday, all remained too close to call, with hundreds of thousands of ballots still uncounted.Speaking to supporters at a drive-in rally in Wilmington Delware, Biden expressed confidence but stopped short of declaring victory. \"I'm here to tell you tonight we believe we are on track to win this election,\" he said.But he added, \"it ain't over until every vote is counted,\" and it may still take a few days to declare a winner. As supporters in cars honked their horns, Biden urged them to \"keep the faith guys, we're gonna win this.\"Trump strode to a podium at the White House shortly after 2 a.m., touting his wins in key states like Ohio and Florida and saying his shrinking leads in battleground states as vote counting continues is \"fraud on the American public.\"He said he would go to the Supreme Court to stop counting votes.\"We don't want then to find any ballots at 4 o'clock in the morning and add them to the list,\" Trump told the crowd of supporters. Moments later, Vice President Mike Pence said he believes the margins Trump has already posted will be enough for victory and \"while the votes continue to be counted, we are going to remain vigilant.\"In neighboring Rhode Island and New Hampshire, incumbent Democratic Sens. Jack Reed and Jeanne Shaheen were quickly declared to have been re-elected. But the battle for Senate control rolled on in other states, including North Carolina, Arizona and Maine \u2013 Republican seats Democrats were hoping to flip.ModuleSenate Republicans went into the night with a 53-47 majority in the Senate but with Democrats seeing a strong chance to win back control of the chamber. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky held his seat, declared the winner early in the evening despite Democrats pouring millions of dollars into the campaign coffers of his challenger, Amy McGrath. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, also a Republican, was also projected to defend his seat against his well-financed challenger, Jamie Harrison.Arizona  \u2014\u2014 the first Trump state of the night that Biden was able flip \u2014 turned out to be a bright spot for Democrats. The state also elected Democrat Mark Kelly to the Senate, unseating Republican Martha McSally.Republicans picked up one Senate seat in Alabama as Republican Tommy Tuberville ousted incumbent Doug Jones.In Georgia, neither incumbent Sen. Kelly Loeffler nor Democratic challenger Raphael Warnock would cross the 50% threshold required to avoid a runoff, meaning that seat will not be decided until January, which could leave Senate control undecided until then.Massachusetts was on a path to set a record for voter turnout in this election, but with the massive wave of early voting and mail-in ballots, polling places were not overwhelmed on election day. Lawyers for Civil Rights \u2013 which played a key role in organizing \u201celection protection\u201d poll monitors with other liberal groups \u2013 said late Tuesday that while there had been scattered incidents of voter intimidation and aggressive electioneering at polling places around the state, there were not major breakdowns in voting or wide swaths of ballots discarded.Across the country, voters were expected to shatter turnout records. Despite the turnout, Tuesday\u2019s voting appeared largely free of any major problems \u2014 despite being held during a deadly pandemic that has killed more than 230,000 Americans. There also were no signs of large-scale voter intimidation efforts or clashes at the polls, as some had feared, given the intensity on either side of the hotly contested race between Trump and Biden.Massachusetts voters approved a ballot question that requires car manufacturers to share wireless vehicle repair data with car owners and independent repair shops. It is the first of its kind in the nation, and there is likely to still be a legislative fight in the state house around the measure's implementation. With about 80% of the vote counted, opponents outnumbered supporters for a second ballot question to convert the state to ranked-choice voting, but that race had not yet been called. Supporters of the measure conceded the race. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

        "body": "Updated at 1:04 a.m. on Nov. 4 Massachusetts voters passed the state\u2019s second right to repair ballot initiative on Tuesday, leading the nation again on policies to level the playing field between big auto-makers and small, independent mechanics.The measure, labeled by advocates as an update to Massachusetts' 2012 right to repair law, enjoyed broad support across the commonwealth, according to unofficial results from the Associated Press. The AP declared the question approved just before 11 p.m.The change means manufacturers that sell vehicles in Massachusetts must now provide wireless repair and maintenance data to car owners and their independent mechanics through an open source platform. The measure applies to vehicles made in model year 2022.Advocates, who pointed to estimates that the vast majority of cars will have the capacity to transmit wireless data by 2022, said the measure keep auto-makers from withholding diagnostic data and cutting independent mechanics out of the repair industry.Opponents said it will unnecessarily make car data more vulnerable to hackers.Backers of the wireless vehicle data question declared victory almost an hour before their opponents conceded.\u201cBy voting yes on 1, Massachusetts has now updated right to repair for the modern age of connected cars,\u201d said Tommy Hickey, Right to Repair Coalition director in a video message to supporters.In a brief email statement, opponents with the Coalition for Safe and Secure Data held fast to their argument against the measure and decried Question 1 as both hazardous and repetitive of the state\u2019s 2012 right to repair ballot initiative.\u201cThe right to repair and the ability of local repair shops to access vehicle repair information are already enshrined in Massachusetts law,\u201d the statement said. \u201cToday\u2019s vote will do nothing to enhance that right \u2013 it will only grant real time, two-way access to your vehicle and increase risk.\u201dThe campaigns for and against Question 1 were each waged with about $25 million from out of state companies and advocacy groups.Massachusetts' 2012 law became a national framework for setting terms between manufacturers, repair shops and third-party diagnostic companies. In an interview with GBH News Tuesday night, Hickey said he anticipates this measure to have a similar impact.\u201cIn Massachusetts, we were the first, we\u2019ll be the first again [and] I do anticipate other states and the federal government taking a look at this, as well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe expect that the car manufacturers will heed the will of the voters and create an open and standardized platform for these model year 2022 cars.\u201dHickey also signaled an anticipated further struggle with the auto-industry to fully implement the law.\"The auto-makers and their army of lobbyists will make noise and make up stories saying it can't be done,\" he said. \"Just like they did during the campaign, in fact, they said the same exact thing about the first right to repair in 2012.\"\u201cI think this is the beginning of a big fight in terms of what car manufacturers are collecting and how much consumers know about that,\u201d he added.State lawmakers who declined to act on a similar bill earlier this year have indicated the measure will likely need adjustments before going into effect.",

        "body": "Massachusetts voters have rejected a ballot initiative to instate ranked-choice voting. Supporters of the measure conceded early Wednesday morning, though the Associated Press had not yet called the race and there were still outstanding votes to be counted.The change would have applied to elections for most state and federal offices in 2022 and beyond, except for the presidency and in races where there are only two candidates.By about 2 a.m., 54% of ballots cast opposed the voting system change with about 83% of municipalities reporting results, according to the Associated Press.ModuleThe organized campaign behind the question took in nearly $10 million, bankrolled in large part by out-of-state contributors. Despite the expensive effort, advocates conceded via email at about 12:40 a.m. Wednesday. \u201cWe came up short in this election, and we are obviously deeply disappointed,\u201d Campaign Manager Cara Brown McCormick said in the statement. \u201cWe were attempting to do something historic in Massachusetts and fell short, but the incredible groundswell of support from volunteers and reformers that assembled behind this campaign is reason enough to stay optimistic about the future of our democracy.\u201d Opponents of ranked-choice, led by the Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance, raised less than 1% of the opposing side's total.Their cause gained two high-profile allies late last month as Gov. Charlie Baker and Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito criticized the measure as one that would \u201cadd an additional layer of complication for both voters and election officials,\u201d the pair said in a joint statement.The state Republican Party also came out against the measure.Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance spokesperson Paul Craney declared almost certain victory in a written statement early Wednesday morning.\u201cOver 75 percent of the votes have been counted and it can be said with a great deal of certainty that the voters of Massachusetts have rejected Question 2,\u201d said Craney, vowing to release a full statement later.Massachusetts voters approved Question 1, a proposal crafted to compel auto-makers to relinquish control of all wireless data necessary to repair and diagnose cars beginning with model year 2022, Tuesday evening.The ranked-choice voting campaign coincided with Jake Auchincloss, the Democratic candidate in the race to replace Rep. Joe Kennedy III\u2019s seat, emerging victorious from a field of nine candidates with less than a third of ballots cast in the September primary. Advocates held up the race as an example of one that would have a different outcome within a ranked-choice system. Auchincloss defeated Republican challenger Julie Hall on Tuesday, the Associated Press reported.  Maine became the first state to utilize ranked-choice voting for its general election after voters approved it in 2016, then voted against a state legislature delay of the system in 2018.The Pine Tree State also became the first to use ranked-choice in a presidential election this year.",

        "body": "Well, we still don't know who the president-elect is.Is there a less-surprising outcome for 2020?Here are six takeaways from one of the strangest election nights in recent history:1. This is going to go on a whileThis election is now coming down to the former Blue Wall states that President Trump toppled in 2016 \u2014 Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. We won't know results perhaps for days, because Wisconsin and Pennsylvania couldn't start processing mail-in votes until Election Day, and Michigan could only start Monday.Philadelphia is expected to report more results at 9 a.m. Wednesday, but it isn't expected to be able to finish counting all of its votes for days. In Detroit, which is expected to hit a 20-year turnout high, officials say they believe they won't be able to finish counting the backlog of absentee ballots until Wednesday night.But, wait, there's even more to count. While all eyes focus on the Upper Midwest and Pennsylvania, there are still many votes to count in North Carolina and Georgia, which looked like healthy Trump wins and then started to shift after midnight.As of 4:05 a.m. ET, Trump was ahead of Democrat Joe Biden in North Carolina by just 1.4 percentage points or fewer than 77,000 votes out of 5 million with 6% of the vote left to count. As the result of a court ruling, North Carolina will be able to count mail-in votes that were postmarked on Election Day until Friday.The candidates are separated by 2.5 percentage points in Georgia, or about 117,000 votes. There is still 7% of the vote to count.This election has taken lots of twists and turns. What's one or two more?2. Trump will pull out all the stopsIt couldn't have been more predictable for Trump to attempt to prematurely declare victory and falsely claim the election is being stolen \u2014 even as legally cast votes are still being counted.There were numerous falsehoods the president told early Wednesday morning during a speech from the White House. He declared that millions had voted for him (a fact) and added \"a very sad group of people is trying to disenfranchise that group of people, and we won't stand for it.\"But the fact is: some states allow ballots mailed in and postmarked by Election Day to be counted. No one is voting any longer.The only disenfranchisement is not counting legally cast ballots \u2014 and Trump vowed to go to the Supreme Court to get them to stop what he sees as illegal vote counting, even though that is not what's happening.3. No matter what happens, this isn't the blowout Democrats were looking forTrump is ahead, but Biden said he expects that when all the votes are counted, including those mail-in ballots, he will prevail.\"I believe we are on track to win this election,\" he said, adding, \"It ain't over until every vote is counted, every ballot is counted.\"As of 4:50 a.m. ET, Biden had a slight lead in Wisconsin with 95% of the vote estimated to be in, but was down almost 6 points in Michigan with 77% in and almost 13 points in Pennsylvania with 64% in.Even if Biden were to win all three \u2014 and he doesn't need to given he won Arizona \u2014 and win the presidency, this wasn't the definitive rebuke of Trump that Democrats were looking for.A win is a win, if Biden is able to pull it off. But the country remains hotly divided and polarized, and given Democrats are unlikely to take back the Senate and their unexpected losses in the House, he would hardly have the ability to get much through Congress.4. The realignment is happeningThe old coalitions are fraying, and it's not at all clear how that translates into presidential elections in the coming years.One thing is clear \u2014 2016 wasn't a fluke. With the swing of white voters without college degrees firmly to Trump's camp, the Blue Wall that Democrats have relied on for decades \u2014 and that Trump knocked down in 2016 \u2014 is far too fragile to rely on.Meanwhile, the diversifying Sun Belt states are changing the map. Biden won Arizona after Clinton came up short in 2016, and Georgia and North Carolina continue to be competitive. (Texas appears to still be a stretch for Democrats).Politics is never static, and the reshaping can be disorienting.5. The popular vote and the Electoral College clash ... againFor the seventh time in the past eight presidential elections, a Democrat will likely win the popular vote.As of 4:15 a.m. ET, Biden was ahead of Trump 67.1 million to 65.2 million. Biden's total is the second most votes any presidential candidate has ever gotten, behind the 69.5 million Barack Obama got in 2008.And yet, if Biden loses, it would be the third time in 20 years that a Democrat would have won the popular vote but lost the presidency.It's unlikely that the process could be changed. Some have argued doing away with it, but it would require a constitutional amendment to change it, and since one side, the Republican Party, has benefitted from it, it's very unlikely to change.6. The polls were wrong ... againAfter all is said and done with this election, there is going to be a reckoning over polls.After 2016, when polls in key states underestimated Trump's support, pollsters said they had adjusted. But, it appears, while polls in some places were right, lots were off and misleading.Biden appeared to have slim but consistent leads heading into Election Day, and many of those dissipated. Ohio, Iowa, Florida, Texas were all polling very close for months, and wound up not close at all. And, unlike 2016, this year even the national polls appear to have been far off.If someone were to say a year ago, create an electoral map for a race between Trump and a generic Democrat, it would look, well, very much like this one based on voting history and demography.There is going to have to be a better understanding of what went wrong. Do Trump voters not pick up the phone or answer polls because they don't trust the media or pollsters? Is there some other reason why pollsters underestimated Trump's support?Being wrong is never a position that a survey researcher or a nonpartisan analyst who uses the data wants to be in.Trump needed an even bigger polling error than 2016 to pull off what he's pulled off, and that's exactly what happened.

        "body": "Elections come and go, but Supreme Court decisions can last forever. One of those potentially pivotal cases is before the court Wednesday. A case both poignant and profound, it pits the rights of a city to enforce its anti-discrimination policies in contracting against the rights of religious groups.On one side is the City of Philadelphia, which contracts with private foster care agencies, and as part of the contract requires that those agencies abide by the city's ban on discriminating against LGBTQ couples. On the other side is Catholic Social Services, which contends that complying with the city's requirement would violate its constitutional right to the free exercise of religion.Philadelphia has protective custody of about 5,000 children who have been abused or neglected. The city contracts with private agencies to care for these children in group homes and to certify, supervise, and place children in individual foster care homes. Among the 30 private agencies that do this work is CSS, affiliated with the Catholic archdiocese, which has contracted with the city for these services for more than 50 years.But in 2018, the Philadelphia Inquirer disclosed that CSS did not certify and place children in the homes of same-sex couples.The city then stopped paying CSS for placing more children in private homes, though it continues to pay for fostering children already placed in the care of CSS families, and for operating group homes and providing other services where there is no discrimination problem.Can a foster parent be excluded from consideration?CSS and two Catholic foster parents sued, contending that the city was violating the Constitution's protection for the free exercise of religion. Two lower courts ruled in favor of the city, and CSS appealed to the Supreme Court, which hears arguments in the case Wednesday.The two parents who joined the CSS suit are single mothers, both African American, both Catholic. One, Sharonell Fulton, has fostered 40 children over 25 years.\"The biggest thrill that I get is when they all sleep and I can walk through and look in their little faces and check their dirty hands,\" she said. \"And I say ... I got this, this is what I want to do. And I wouldn't be able to do it without Catholic Social Services.\"The other, Toni Simms-Busch, has fostered five children, and through fostering has adopted brothers who are now 2 and 4. For Simms-Busch, who had worked with CSS as a child advocate, fostering through CSS was a \"no-brainer.\" She says that there simply are \"no other agencies that hold the same values and beliefs and religious foundation as Catholic Social Services.\" CSS is there when she needs them, she says, morning or night.There are, of course, other wonderful foster parents who are not in the CSS family. Among them are same-sex married couples like Lou Growmiller and his husband, Michael, who have been together for 15 years and fostered children over a 10-year period. Through their fostering experience, they have reunited one child with her parents the day before Christmas, and have adopted two \u2014 a girl, now 9, who they brought home from the neonatal intensive care unit as an infant, and a boy, now almost 7.Because Lou Growmiller, a social worker, oversees one of the largest adoption and foster care agencies in the city, he and Michael decided to work through an agency just outside Philadelphia. They see themselves as leading members of their community. Lou is now on the PTA board of his children's school and he views the CSS refusal to work with gay couples as making no sense when the need for foster parents is so great.Why, he asks, \"would that be a reason to deny people to be a temporary safe haven to children, vulnerable children and kids who need it?\" Of course, CSS sees the city's refusal to let it place more children in individual foster homes as equally nonsensical.Is the city discriminating against Catholics?There are basically two legal questions before the Supreme Court. First, whether Philadelphia's decision not to renew one of its contracts with CSS violates the First Amendment guarantee to the free exercise of religion.\"The City of Philadelphia is telling [foster parents] it will not place any more children in their homes because they're Catholic and they chose to partner with Catholic Social Services,\" says lawyer Lori Windham, of the Becket Fund, who will represent CSS in the Supreme Court on Wednesday. Windham adds that \"at bottom this is about the City of Philadelphia trying to exclude Catholic Social Services from work it's been doing for two centuries.\"\"Nothing could be further from the truth,\" counters lawyer Neal Katyal, who will represent the City of Philadelphia in the Supreme Court. \"We adore CSS. We've been partners with them for years and years, and indeed right now we're giving them over $17 million a year in contacts\" for group homes and other services, he says.That said, however, the city has refused to renew the $2.9 million contract for future home foster care placements by CSS. As the city sees it, CSS has violated the terms of its contract by its policy of refusing to consider same-sex married couples for placement.\"You can't on Monday sign a contract that says we won't discriminate and on Tuesday go ahead and discriminate,\" says Katyal. And he notes that the Supreme Court has long said governments are at the apex of their power in contracting for goods and services.CSS explains that it would be happy to refer same-sex couples to other agencies, and that there are 29 others operating in Philadelphia. In addition, CSS maintains that no gay couple has even approached CSS for foster care home placement, prompting Katyal to respond that \"the National Baptist Association points out that if one of the agencies had a sign saying, 'No Baptists allowed,' it would be cold comfort to those folks who say, 'Oh, you could just go somewhere else.'\"Seeking the reversal of a 1990 Scalia decisionIn 1990, the Supreme Court ruled that when the government has a \"generally applicable\" law or regulation and enforces that law neutrally, the government's action is presumptively legitimate even if it has some \"incidental\" adverse impact on some citizens.The court said that an individual's religious beliefs do not excuse him from compliance with an otherwise valid law prohibiting conduct that government is free to regulate. Allowing exceptions to every state law or regulation affecting religion, the court said, \"would open the prospect of constitutionally required exemptions from civic obligations of almost every conceivable kind,\" from compulsory military service to vaccination requirements, and child-neglect laws.The author of that opinion was the late Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative icon and a devout Catholic. Which leads to the second major legal question before the court \u2014 whether the justices should, as CSS is urging, overturn Scalia's decision.CSS maintains that the decision should be reversed because the non-discrimination provision in the Philadelphia contract is unconstitutionally forcing the agency and its clients to endorse same-sex marriage, in violation of their faith.As Toni Simms-Busch puts it, \"It is taking away my right as a religious person, as a person of faith\" to \"foster or adopt through an agency who has a shared belief.\"Not true, says Katyal, the lawyer for the city. Philadelphia continues to pay for foster children already placed by CSS in homes like Simms-Busch's. \"The one thing that we aren't going to do,\" explains Katyal, \"is to allow them to screen new parents based on their discriminatory policies.\"Has Philadelphia targeted CSS for exclusion?CSS contends that the city has, in essence, targeted CSS because of its religious beliefs, and points to a comment made by the mayor. But Katyal counters that the mayor had nothing to do with the city's foster care contracts, and that stray political comments here were irrelevant, especially when compared to President Trump's comments about Muslims, which the Supreme Court ignored in upholding the travel ban.There simply is no hostility to CSS, Katyal contends, and the proof of that is that the city has not ended its other contracts with CSS. Nor, he argues, is the certification process undertaken by CSS a religious endorsement of prospective foster parents.\"All they have to do is a checklist and say, is this family is suitable ... to be foster care parents? They don't have to approve them in the eyes of God,\" Katyal argues. He maintains that CSS has \"manufactured some sort of tension between their obligations under state law and the contract\" to certify and supervise foster parents. \"There's simply no conflict, and that's the easiest way for the court to resolve this case,\" Katyal says.That's not how Mark Rienzi of the Becket Fund sees things. The state law and the city contracts are not neutral, he maintains. Yes, he says, if you have 10 stores you can go into, and you choose one, that choice would not normally raise the question of the free exercise of religion. \"But if you're being excluded from one specifically because of the religious exercise that's going on there, which is the case here, then I do think that is a free exercise problem\" he says.Several of the Supreme Court's most conservative justices have in fact urged revisiting Justice Scalia's 1990 decision. And the Court's newest Justice, Amy Coney Barrett, served on the board of her children's private religious school, which, according to the Associated Press, did not admit the children of same-sex couples.Revisiting LGBT versus religious rightsIn the last analysis, Wednesday's case picks up on the question the Supreme Court ducked two years ago in the case of a Colorado baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple. The court in that case punted, ruling that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission exhibited hostility to religion in considering the baker's case. But the court did not say whether the state's non-discrimination provision would violate the baker's rights without that hostility.That is the question that hangs over the Philadelphia case. And if the court decides to overrule Justice Scalia's 1990 precedent, it would almost certainly accelerate the conservative court's trend toward greater and greater deference to religious rights, likely at the expense of other rights and values, including laws that bar discrimination.

        "body": "Updated at 11:23 p.m. WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Joe Biden won the battleground prizes of Michigan and Wisconsin on Wednesday, reclaiming a key part of the \u201cblue wall\u201d that slipped away from Democrats four years ago and dramatically narrowing President Donald Trump's pathway to reelection.A full day after Election Day, neither candidate had cleared the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the White House. But Biden's victories in the Great Lakes states left him at 264, meaning he was one battleground state away from crossing the threshold and becoming president-elect.Biden, who has received more than 71 million votes, the most in history, was joined by his running mate Kamala Harris at an afternoon news conference and said he now expected to win the presidency, though he stopped short of outright declaring victory.\u201cI will govern as an American president,\u201d Biden said. \u201dThere will be no red states and blue states when we win. Just the United States of America.\"It was a stark contrast to Trump, who on Wednesday falsely proclaimed that he had won the election, even though millions of votes remained uncounted and the race was far from over.The Associated Press called Wisconsin for Biden after election officials in the state said all outstanding ballots had been counted, save for a few hundred in one township and an expected small number of provisional votes.Trump\u2019s campaign requested a recount, though statewide recounts in Wisconsin have historically changed the vote tally by only a few hundred votes. Biden led by 0.624 percentage point out of nearly 3.3 million ballots counted.Since 2016, Democrats had been haunted by the crumbling of the blue wall, the trio of Great Lakes states \u2014 Pennsylvania is the third \u2014 that their candidates had been able to count on every four years. But Trump's populist appeal struck a chord with white working-class voters and he captured all three in 2016 by a total margin of just 77,000 votes.Both candidates this year fiercely fought for the states, with Biden's everyman political persona resonating in blue-collar towns while his campaign also pushed to increase turnout among Black voters in cities like Detroit and Milwaukee.Pennsylvania remained too early to call Wednesday night.It was unclear when or how quickly a national winner could be determined after a long, bitter campaign dominated by the coronavirus and its effects on Americans and the national economy. But Biden's possible pathways to the White House were expanding rapidly.After the victories in Wisconsin and Michigan, he was just six Electoral College votes away from the presidency. A win in any undecided state except for Alaska \u2014 but including Nevada, with its six votes \u2014 would be enough to end Trump\u2019s tenure in the White House.Trump spent much of Wednesday in the White House residence, huddling with advisers and fuming at media coverage showing his Democratic rival picking up key battlegrounds. Trump falsely claimed victory in several key states and amplified unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about Democratic gains as absentee and early votes were tabulated.Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien said the president would formally request a Wisconsin recount, citing \u201cirregularities\" in several counties. And the campaign said it was filing suit in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia to demand better access for campaign observers to locations where ballots are being processed and counted, and to raise absentee ballot concerns.At the same time, hundreds of thousands of votes were still to be counted in Pennsylvania, and Trump\u2019s campaign said it was moving to intervene in the existing Supreme Court litigation over counting mail-in ballots there. Yet, the campaign also argued that it was the outstanding votes in Arizona that could reverse the outcome there, showcasing an inherent inconsistency with their arguments.In other closely watched races, Trump picked up Florida, the largest of the swing states, and held onto Texas and Ohio while Biden kept New Hampshire and Minnesota and flipped Arizona, a state that had reliably voted Republican in recent elections.The unsettled nature of the presidential race was reflective of a somewhat disappointing night for Democrats, who had hoped to deliver a thorough repudiation of Trump's four years in office while also reclaiming the Senate to have a firm grasp on all of Washington. But the GOP held onto several Senate seats that had been considered vulnerable, including in Iowa, Texas, Maine and Kansas. Democrats lost House seats but were expected to retain control there.The high-stakes election was held against the backdrop of a historic pandemic that has killed more than 232,000 Americans and wiped away millions of jobs. The U.S. on Wednesday set another record for daily confirmed coronavirus cases as several states posted all-time highs.The candidates spent months pressing dramatically different visions for the nation\u2019s future, including on racial justice, and voters responded in huge numbers, with more than 100 million people casting votes ahead of Election Day.Trump, in an extraordinary move from the White House, issued premature claims of victory \u2014 which he continued on Twitter Wednesday \u2014 and said he would take the election to the Supreme Court to stop the counting. It was unclear exactly what legal action he could try to pursue.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell discounted the president\u2019s quick claim of victory, saying it would take a while for states to conduct their vote counts. The Kentucky Republican said Wednesday that \u201cclaiming you\u2019ve won the election is different from finishing the counting.\u201dVote tabulations routinely continue beyond Election Day, and states largely set the rules for when the count has to end. In presidential elections, a key point is the date in December when presidential electors met. That\u2019s set by federal law.Dozens of Trump supporters chanting \u201cStop the count!\u201d descended on a ballot-tallying center in Detroit, while thousands of anti-Trump protesters demanding a complete vote count took to the streets in cities across the U.S.Protests \u2014 sometimes about the election, sometimes about racial inequality \u2014 took place Wednesday in at least a half-dozen cities, including Los Angeles, Seattle, Houston, Pittsburgh, Minneapolis and San Diego.Several states allow mailed-in votes to be accepted as long as they were postmarked by Tuesday. That includes Pennsylvania, where ballots postmarked by Nov. 3 can be accepted if they arrive up to three days later.Trump appeared to suggest those ballots should not be counted, and that he would fight for that outcome at the high court. But legal experts were dubious of Trump's declaration. Trump has appointed three of the high court's nine justices \u2014 including, most recently, Amy Coney Barrett.The Trump campaign on Wednesday pushed Republican donors to dig deeper into their pockets to help finance legal challenges. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, during a donor call, spoke plainly: \u201cThe fight\u2019s not over. We\u2019re in it.\u201dThe momentum from early voting carried into Election Day, as an energized electorate produced long lines at polling sites throughout the country. Turnout was higher than in 2016 in numerous counties, including all of Florida, nearly every county in North Carolina and more than 100 counties in both Georgia and Texas. That tally seemed sure to increase as more counties reported their turnout figures.Voters braved worries of the coronavirus, threats of polling place intimidation and expectations of long lines caused by changes to voting systems, but appeared undeterred as turnout appeared it would easily surpass the 139 million ballots cast four years ago.Jaffe reported from Wilmington, Delaware.
