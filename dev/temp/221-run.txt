Constitution spells out who’s in charge when the governor and lieutenant governor travel.', 'content': 'As military members and elected officials gathered at the State House Tuesday to honor Marines who served in the Battle of Iwo Jima, neither Gov. Maura Healey nor Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll was on hand. Instead, sitting quietly to the side (until it was his turn to offer remarks), was the man who steps in when both Healey and Driscoll — and their predecessors for the last three decades — are away: Secretary of State Bill Galvin. Healey and Driscoll are both out of state during the February school vacation week, Healey in Florida until Thursday and Driscoll in Georgia until Sunday. When both leave Massachusetts, an acting governor is in charge. Under the Massachusetts Constitution, when both the governor’s and lieutenant governor’s office are vacant — “by reason of death, absence from the commonwealth, or otherwise” — it’s up to the secretary of state to fulfill duties of both. In this case, that means Galvin, a Brighton Democrat who’s taken on the acting governor role many times since he was first elected secretary in 1994 — so many times, in fact, that a spokesperson said he’s likely lost count. If Healey, Driscoll and Galvin are all out of state (or if one of them leaves office for another reason), the line of succession moves across the other statewide elected officers. In order, it’s: Attorney General Andrea Campbell, Treasurer Deb Goldberg and Auditor Diana DiZoglio. The state constitution stops there, specifying no further acting governors after the auditor. During a vacancy of the two top offices, the constitution gives the acting governor “full power and authority to do and execute all and every such acts, matters and things as the governor or the lieutenant-governor might or could lawfully do or execute, if they, or either of them, were personally present.”Galvin over the years has signed bills while serving as acting governor, and if a natural disaster or other emergency breaks out while he is in charge, he’ll need to step in for the response. He’s also filed bills at times. The one "that brought him the most notoriety" was a 1998 bill that sought to force more financial transparency from HMOs, according to a 2003 New York Times profile that said he’s held the acting governor role more times than anyone else in Massachusetts history. In most cases, though, an acting governor taking the reins is a brief, behind-the-scenes occurrence, involving close communication with the traveling governor and little impact on the day-to-day for most Massachusetts residents. Typically, the governor and lieutenant governor are not both away from Massachusetts for extended periods of time. The line of succession takes on more significance in the instances when the state is without a lieutenant governor — for instance, after Lt. Gov. Tim Murray resigned in 2013, Galvin regularly had to step in when then-Gov. Deval Patrick was away.Governor is not the only office whose duties can shift with travel plans. In Boston, if the mayor is away from the city or otherwise unable to perform their duties, the City Council president becomes acting mayor.', 'category': 'Politics', 'pubDate': 'Tue, 21 Feb 2023 14:42:37 EST', 'UID': '43dea19b91cb7e5d2e5333dadeddaaa4'}, {'title': 'Boston Public Radio full show: Feb. 14, 2023', 'link': 'https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/02/21/boston-public-radio-full-show-feb-14-2023', 'description': 'Listen to the full episode of Boston Public Radio from Feb. 14, 2023.', 'content': "Today on Boston Public Radio:Boston Mayor Michelle Wu joined for “Ask the Mayor,” discussing her new rent control proposal and taking listener calls.NBC Sports Boston anchor and reporter Trenni Casey talked about last weekend’s Super Bowl.Boston Globe advice columnist Meredith Goldstein discussed Valentine's Day and her “Love Letters” columns and podcast.Attorney General for Massachusetts Andrea Campbell joined for her first-ever edition of “Ask the AG,” discussing a new abortion legal hotline that can be reached by calling or texting (833) 309-6301.

It was one of the deadliest nightclub fires in the nation's history, and an event that has had lasting consequences for hundreds of families. Northeastern law professor and GBH legal analyst Daniel Medwed joined Morning Edition co-hosts Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel to discuss the legal issues related to the catastrophe and how the law has evolved in response to it. This transcript has been lightly edited. Paris Alston: So let's start with an overview. What happened that night? Daniel Medwed: At around 11 p.m. on Feb., 20, 2003, the heavy metal band Great White took the stage at the Station nightclub. And to accompany their first song, their tour manager launched some pyrotechnics. Unfortunately, the soundproofing in the walls and ceilings surrounding the stage contained some flammable foam, acoustic foam, that immediately ignited and created what some fire scientists would call a flashover effect, which is basically, as far as they understand it, when every combustible item in the vicinity of an enclosed space basically goes ablaze, creating lots of flames and heat and smoke. It caused a stampede. And as you said at the outset, 100 people died in the aftermath of this event, making it the second-deadliest fire in New England nightclub history, surpassed only by the infamous Cocoanut Grove disaster back in 1942, right here in Boston. Jeremy Siegel: This was devastating. And when you have this many people who were killed, there's obviously a lot of finger-pointing and discussion about who was at fault. How would you describe what went wrong here and who might legally or morally be deemed responsible for it? Medwed: Well, that's exactly right. There was a lot of blame being bandied about to different people, and it seemed like three different parties deserve to shoulder a lot of the responsibility. First and foremost, there was the tour manager, Daniel Biechele, who, after all, ignited those pyrotechnics. They were for gerbs, which are cylindrical devices that contain controlled sprays of sparks. There's a little bit of a dispute about whether he had authorization from the nightclub to do this, but he was certainly one of the people who shouldered a lot of the blame. Second, there were the nightclub owners, the Derderians, two brothers who purchased it back in 2000. Now, even though there were four exits in the facility, a lot of people died during the stampede because of a bottleneck in a narrow space near the front door. It made sense that a lot of people were trying to exit through the entrance where they had come from, right? In addition, this was aggravated by the fact that it had a maximum occupancy of 404 people and there were 462 people in the venue that night. Third, and finally, there were many perceived breakdowns in the fire safety inspection protocol process. And the city of West Warwick, the state of Rhode Island, also shouldered part of the blame here. Alston: Daniel, you just mentioned that there were breakdowns in the safety inspections. What exactly happened there? Medwed: On the one hand, there was the absence of an automatic fire sprinkler. So when this building was constructed back in 1946, it was designed as a restaurant. And under Rhode Island Fire Code at the time, a restaurant of that size did not require fire sprinklers. However, when it was converted decades later into a nightclub, that exemption should have disappeared and sprinklers should have been installed. A really fatal oversight here. On the other hand, there was the problem of that flammable acoustic foam that I mentioned earlier. The West Warwick fire marshal had conducted two fire inspections of the Station nightclub in the months preceding this event. During the first inspection, nine minor code violations were found. They were apparently remedied. And the second time around, the nightclub got a clean bill of health. But the fire marshal never detected the presence of this foam, which was actually against code at the time. Siegel: So what ended up happening legally here? Did anyone face criminal charges? Medwed: Yes. The tour manager and the Derderian brothers, who owned the Station, all faced criminal manslaughter charges based on two separate theories. One was that they had engaged in negligence, that their behavior was a gross departure, an extreme departure, from what a reasonable tour manager or nightclub owner would have done in this situation. The other theory was something called misdemeanor manslaughter, which holds that if you commit a petty crime and someone dies, you're on the hook for the homicide, regardless of whether you intended it, or was reckless, or anything. All three men ultimately pled guilty. Biechele went first and he received a sentence of four years in prison, 11 years of a suspended sentence and three years of probation. Now, there was some outcry from people who felt like this was quite lenient. But by all accounts, Biechele was incredibly contrite and remorseful, just crushed by these events. And that was a factor, a mitigating factor, in his sentence. One of the owners, one of the Derderians, got the same exact sentence through his guilty plea. And the other brother, who is considered far less culpable, got 500 hours of community service. Alston: So, Daniel, all of this is making me think about the Ghost Ship warehouse fire in Oakland, California, in 2016. I know, Jeremy, you were there when that happened, right? Siegel: Yeah, I actually covered the case that ended up in an acquittal and a mistrial for the people charged with manslaughter in it. Alston: Right. And we know there were some code violations involved with that fire. And Daniel, this was the deadliest building fire in the U.S. since the one at the Station nightclub. Which makes me wonder how those fire code and safety regulations changed, or didn't, in response to this. Medwed: Well, that's a great question. Obviously, these events continue to happen. So there's something beyond the fire code that's probably a problem here. But there were some positive developments in the aftermath of the Station tragedy, and here are a few of them: Immediately afterwards, the governor of Rhode Island issued a moratorium on the use of pyrotechnics in small venues. There also was a movement that began to gain traction to create fire sprinkler laws across the country. In addition, the organization that creates guidelines for fire safety, it's called the National Fire Protection Association, revised their guidelines and created better guidelines. So there were some good developments as a result of this.", 'category': 'Local', 'pubDate': 'Tue, 21 Feb 2023 10:56:36 EST', 'UID': '9dc0dbb493f35cf4519889dcef8ec862'}, {'title': 'Supreme Court showdown for Google, Twitter and the social media world', 'link': 'https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/02/21/supreme-court-showdown-for-google-twitter-and-the-social-media-world', 'description': 'In November 2015, ISIS terrorists carried out coordinated attacks across Paris, killing 130 people and injuring 400.

Among the dead was Nohemi Gonzalez, a 23-year-old American studying abroad who was the first person in her large family to graduate from college. This week, lawyers for her family and others are in the Supreme Court challenging a law enacted more than a quarter century ago—a law that protects social media companies from what the families see as the role of internet companies in aiding and abetting terrorist attacks. How the court rules could be a gamechanger for American law, society, and social media platforms that are some of the most valuable businesses in the world. What the law says At the center of two cases to be argued over two days is Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, passed by Congress when internet platforms were just beginning. In just 26 words, Section 230 draws a distinction between interactive computer service providers and other purveyors of information. Whereas newspapers and broadcasters can be sued for defamation and other wrongful conduct, Section 230 says that websites are not publishers or speakers and cannot be sued for material that appears on those sites. Essentially, the law treats web platforms the same way that it treats the telephone. And just like phone companies, websites that are host to speakers cannot be sued for what the speakers say or do. At least that is the way the lower courts have uniformly interpreted Section 230. They have said that under the law, social media companies are immune from being sued for civil damages over most material that appears on their platforms. That is so, even though, at the same time, the law has an apparently contrary objective: It encourages social media companies to remove material that is obscene, lewd, excessively violent, harassing or otherwise objectionable.The attack at the heart of the arguments This week\'s cases attempt to thread that needle. The Gonzalez family and the families of other terrorism victims are suing Google, Twitter, Facebook and other social media companies under the federal Anti-Terrorism Act, which specifically allows civil damage claims for aiding and abetting terrorism. The families allege that the companies did more than simply provide platforms for communication. Rather, they contend, that by recommending ISIS videos to those who might be interested, they were seeking to get more viewers and increase their ad revenue. Representing the terrorism victims against Google and Twitter, lawyer Eric Schnapper will tell the Supreme Court this week that when Section 230 was enacted, social media companies wanted people to subscribe to their services, but today the economic model is different. "Now most of the money is made by advertisements, and social media companies make more money the longer you are online," he says, adding that one way to do that is by algorithms that recommend other related material to keep users online longer. What\'s more, he argues, modern social media company executives knew the dangers of what they were doing. In 2016, he says, they met with high government officials who told them of the dangers posed by ISIS videos, and how they were used for recruitment, propaganda, fundraising, and planning. "The attorney general, the director of the FBI, the director of national intelligence, and the then-White House chief of staff . . . those government officials . . . told them exactly that," he says. Google general counsel Halimah DeLaine Prado vehemently denies any such wrongdoing. "We believe that there\'s no place for extremist content on any of our products or platforms," she says, noting that Google has "heavily invested in human review" and "smart detection technology," to "make sure that happens." Prado acknowledges that social media companies today are nothing like the social media companies of 1996, when the interactive internet was an infant industry. But, she says, if there is to be a change in the law, that is something that should be done by Congress, not the courts. The choice before the court Daniel Weitzner, the founding director of the MIT Internet Policy Research Initiative, helped draft Section 230 and get it passed in 1996."Congress had a really clear choice in its mind," he says. "Was the internet going to be like the broadcast media that were pretty highly regulated?" Or, was it going to be like "the town square or the printing press?" Congress, he says, "chose the town square and the printing press." But, he adds, that approach is now at risk: "The Supreme court now really is in a moment where it could dramatically limit the diversity of speech that the internet enables."There are many "strange bedfellows" among the tech company allies in this week\'s cases. Groups ranging from the conservative Chamber of Commerce to the libertarian ACLU have filed an astonishing 48 briefs urging the court to leave the status quo in place.But the Biden administration has a narrower position. Columbia law professor Timothy Wu summarizes the administration\'s position this way: "It is one thing to be more passively presenting, even organizing information, but when you cross the line into really recommending content, you leave behind the protections of 230." In short, hyperlinks, grouping certain content together, sorting through billions of pieces of data for search engines, that sort of thing is OK, but actually recommending content that shows or urges illegal conduct is another.If the Supreme Court were to adopt that position, it would be very threatening to the economic model of social media companies today. The tech industry says there is no easy way to distinguish between aggregating and recommending.And it likely would mean that these companies would constantly be defending their conduct in court. But filing suit, and getting over the hurdle of showing enough evidence to justify a trial--those are two different things. What\'s more, the Supreme Court has made it much more difficult to jump that hurdle. The second case the court hears this week, on Wednesday, deals with just that problem.What makes this week\'s cases so remarkable is that the Supreme Court has never dealt with Section 230. The fact that the justices have agreed to hear the cases shows that they have concerns. Justice Clarence Thomas has been outspoken about his view that the law should be narrowly interpreted, meaning little protection for social media companies. Justice Samuel Alito has indicated he might agree with that. But the views of the other justices are something of a black box.The cases are Gonzalez v. Google LLC and Twitter, Inc. v.

At night, tired and hungry, the Guatemalan immigrant would be driven back to his employer’s suburban home, where he would head down to the basement to sleep on a leaking, plastic blow-up mattress that would deflate in the middle of the night.Julio — who GBH News agreed to identify with a pseudonym to protect him from retribution — says he was promised $14 an hour when he was first hired, but was paid less than $100 each week despite working long hours with no days off. Yet he felt he couldn’t walk away because his employer also provided something he couldn’t afford on his own: a roof over his head."I had no money and I had nowhere to go,’’ said Julio, who spoke to GBH News in Spanish with the help of an interpreter.Julio’s story is not unique. The GBH News Center for Investigative Reporting has found similar tales often repeated by migrant workers in Massachusetts: the use of housing to trap them in jobs where they receive little or no pay. Alleged victims include workers forced to toil long hours in restaurants and cleaning buildings, sometimes held hostage by their own family members, court records and interviews show. Federal law defines labor trafficking as someone being compelled to work through “force, fraud or coercion.” Diego Low, director of the MetroWest Worker Center in Framingham, says he has represented dozens of mainly undocumented immigrants who were provided housing by employers and a pittance of what they should have been paid for their labor. In addition to Julio, Low cited two other cases that he said met the legal criteria of labor trafficking: "a nanny and a housekeeper whose passports were taken away," and lived under the roofs of their employers. He said both cases were successfully adjudicated and recognized as trafficking, but there were no consequences for the employer. "One of them left the country so as not to not to have to answer for their behavior," Low said. “One of the situations that easily becomes coercive are situations where someone is housed by the employer,” said Low, who also represented Julio. “Because to challenge the employer means not knowing where you\'re going to sleep that night.” Sixty-four percent of survivors of labor and sex trafficking say they were recruited when they were experiencing homelessness or unstable housing, according to a recent national survey conducted by Polaris, a nonprofit anti-trafficking organization based in Washington, D.C. Labor trafficking victims include seasonal workers coming to the U.S. to work, homeless youth forced to sell drugs and others pressured to work to stay in transitional or group homes, the report showed.Amy Farrell, director of Northeastern University’s School of Criminology and Criminal Justice, says the fear of homelessness is a huge pressure for those stuck in exploitative jobs, especially in Massachusetts, which has the seventh highest rent in the country, according to U.S. News and World Report. And in the Greater Boston area, rents are now the second highest in the country, based on an analysis by Zumper. “In a place like Massachusetts, where housing is incredibly expensive … if you leave the job, you\'re homeless — you lose your housing, you have nowhere to stay,’’ she said. “So this [labor trafficking prompted by lack of housing] is very, very common. Housing is actually one of the best ways to keep a person in a situation of servitude.” Farrell urges people to keep an eye out when they see workers come to their house — and report concerns. “All of us have had this experience where you may have had somebody come to do landscaping or come to do construction in your house and you had a bad feeling about it, but they were only there for a day,’’ she said. “Maybe you lived with that bad feeling and didn\'t report it to anyone.” Indicators of labor trafficking include individuals working in hazardous conditions without proper safety gear, training, or other protections or who are “living in dangerous, overcrowded, inhumane conditions provided by an employer,” according to Polaris. By one estimate, there are about 210,000 undocumented immigrants in Massachusetts. Because of the very nature of their unlawful status, there is no data showing how many among them are victims of labor trafficking and other forms of exploitation, but Farrell, an expert on human trafficking, said the issue is pervasive. She said a conversation with a worker who appears to be in distress might prove helpful. She suggests reporting credible indicators of labor trafficking to the state Attorney General\'s Office and the National Human Trafficking Hotline. One alleged victim in Massachusetts is an undocumented immigrant in her 60s from Portugal, who testified in state court in 2020 that she was paid almost nothing for cleaning offices at night after being provided housing by her alleged trafficker. The woman, identified as A.C., is one of two alleged victims of a janitor named Fernando Roland, currently being charged with labor trafficking by the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office in Bristol County Superior Court. A.C. testified in court that she had been recently widowed and was on the brink of being kicked out of her house when she reached out to Roland for help.“He said he would find me a room and give me a job,” she said. Prosecutors allege that Roland put A.C. to work in a cleaning company where he was employed, but punched her time card in and out under his name and pocketed her wages. Roland has pleaded not guilty and the case is pending. But A.C. testified in open court that the man she thought was her friend took total control over her after promising to help her find a job and a decent place to live. Instead, she said, he confined her to a tiny space in a boarding house, drove her back and forth to work, confiscated her passport, and provided her almost no money to survive. Almost every cent went to pay for the room she lived in. “He didn’t give me food or water. I would go hungry,’’ she testified. “He controlled my life.” An attorney for Roland declined to discuss his client’s case with GBH News. The use of housing as a trap for exploited workers also was cited as a factor in the recent federal raid of two Brazilian restaurants in Woburn.Last year, Woburn restaurateurs Jesse and Hugo Moraes were charged in federal court with human smuggling for bringing immigrants into the country, housing them and then paying them meager or no wages for their work. One of the alleged victims told law enforcement that they worked 14 hours a day with no days off for a month, earning about $3 an hour. When they complained about working conditions and wanted to stop, they were told they would have to leave the house. GBH News spoke with Boston attorney Paul Kelly, who represents Hugo Moraes. He said evidence will prove that his client is not guilty. At a detention hearing in October, Alyssa Thrasher Hackett, a public defender and lawyer for Jesse Moraes, told a federal judge that her client “has given everything to his children … he has lived his life for other people,” and denied that he was a danger to anyone. Lidia Ferreira, a worker\'s rights organizer for the Brazilian Women’s Group in Brighton, says she often hears of people brought to the United States by family members and then exploited for free labor. She said these are some of the hardest cases to prove in court because of the family connections.“We have a lot of different cases of workers who lived with the employer who is a relative and was also the landlord,’’ she said. “They come from Brazil and the person says ‘I have a place. You can come and rent a room in my apartment, and then you can work for me the next day.’”Among those, Ferreira described the case of Danny Sousa, who was charged in Bristol County Superior Court in 2014 for allegedly trafficking two relatives he’d invited to the country and put up in his home. Prosecutors say that the minute they arrived, the couple were put to work — 15 hours a day, seven days a week — and paid only a fraction of what they had been promised. When they asked for their unpaid wages, prosecutors say, Sousa took out a gun and said, “I don’t owe anyone any money in this house.” But in 2017, a Bristol County Superior Court judge, while concluding that a gun was present, ruled in favor of Sousa, concluding that the evidence of human trafficking presented to a grand jury “failed to show the couple was subjected to forced service.” In a footnote, the court noted that the couple’s “travel expenses, room, and board were paid for by the defendant and his wife.” For anti-trafficking advocates, the case was a defeat — but some say the big surprise was that the case was heard at all. An ongoing investigation by GBH News called Trafficking Inc. has shown that labor trafficking cases are rarely filed in Massachusetts courts. The vast majority of examples of forced labor never reach a court of law, advocates say, largely because victims are afraid to speak out and law enforcement often mistake labor crimes for wage disputes. Julio’s eight months in a basement is one such example. On most weekdays in front of Padaria Brasil bakery on Concord Street in Framingham, immigrant men congregate — even on some of the coldest days — hoping to pick up day labor from one of the many small contractors who trawl the area looking for help on the cheap. It used to be mainly Brazilians who waited there hoping to grab a few hours of work. These days, it\'s largely Indigenous men from Central and South America who stand near the bakery with that goal in mind. This is where Julio heard about a landscaping contractor who was looking for a full-time worker and promising to pay $14 an hour. The contractor was hired by a national retailer to do landscaping, among other contracts. The job offer came with a guarantee of housing, which Julio desperately needed. After what he described as a grueling journey to reach the United States from Guatemala, he said he was shocked at the cost of renting — not just an apartment, but even a single room in Massachusetts. So it seemed like the fulfillment of an American dream to have a free place to live as long as he remained in the employ of the contractor, and a job that would allow him to send money back to his family.“I had been without work for 42 days and was beating the bushes with friends trying to find work,” Julio said. “And someone said to me, ‘We know of this guy. We don\'t know him well, but he has a company and maybe you could find work with him.’” Julio says the contractor picked him up, brought him to his house on a dead-end street, and gave him a place to sleep. But Julio was forced to work from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. with little sustenance. He lost 20 pounds. “I was given a cup of coffee in the morning, not even bread,” he said.GBH News is not disclosing the name of the contractor because Julio is afraid of retaliation. But reporters were able to corroborate some of Julio’s story from documents in the possession of the MetroWest Worker Center-Casa Del Trabalhar in Framingham, which is helping with his legal fight.Weekdays were terrible, he said. But weekends were no better. His employer would put food outside the basement door so he wouldn’t enter the house when guests were coming over. Sometimes, he says, he would ask for more money to buy food and get nothing, his employer asking him where his earnings had gone. “I told him that I had sent money back to my family. And he said, \'Remember, you know, your focus has to be on your reality here. The situation back there, you just have to forget that.’” After eight months, Julio gave notice to his employer. “I told him that I needed to move on and to drop me off at such and such an address. And he said, \'OK,\'” said Julio. He says the man took a long route to make sure he didn’t know where he had been living. “Even though it was relatively nearby, minutes away, he took this long, circuitous route of about an hour to get me there,” he said. Once in downtown Framingham, Julio walked to a building just yards from the Brazilian bakery on Concord Street and climbed the old wooden steps to the second floor to meet Diego Low. Low said he and his staff put together a plan to address what he believed was a clear-cut case of labor trafficking that included, in this instance, a critical defining element: coercion, in the form of the housing provided to his client as a condition for staying on the job. “We tried to put pressure on the national retailer for whom they were doing the landscaping to get these folks paid, because it wasn\'t just Julio,” Low said. “Julio was the one who lived on the property. But there were four workers that we were trying to assist in recovering their wages. Most of the rest of them went back to their country, moved on in life and didn\'t recover.” The national retailer refused to accept any responsibility for Julio’s and other workers’ exploitation, said Low. He pursued fair labor charges against the subcontractor and filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Office of the Attorney General. A lawyer representing Julio sued the landscaping subcontractor and succeeded in getting back wages amounting to $11,000. But no criminal charges for human trafficking were filed.Many migrant workers have learned to take care of themselves — and each other. Julio says the Guatemalan, Ecuadorian and Indigenous workers who assemble in front of the bakery have developed their own warning system. “You talk to folks who are owed unpaid wages and they often won\'t know the details of their employer’s identity,’’ he said. “But if you ask about their truck and their logo and whatever, you often can determine if they’re a known actor.” Julio was eventually able to find a stable job and home and has moved his wife and children to the United States. He’s disappointed the landscaping subcontractor was not held accountable — and worries there may be a newly trafficked worker living today in his former employer’s cold, dusty basement. “I have no way of knowing for certain,’’ he said. “But if he did it once, what\'s to keep him from doing it again?” SeparatorThe ongoing series Trafficking Inc. is part of a partnership with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and other media partners.', 'category': 'Local', 'pubDate': 'Mon, 20 Feb 2023 05:00:10 EST', 'UID': 'e73d9b24942286cf6ef844c18dd9807d'}, {'title': 'Kamala Harris has nearly disappeared into the background', 'link': 'https://www.wgbh.org/news/commentary/2023/02/20/kamala-harris-has-nearly-disappeared-into-the-background', 'description': 'With rare exception, we haven’t seen her out front demonstrating the political talents that made her a standout.', 'content': 'There she was standing at the podium during the funeral of Tyre Nichols. Vice President Kamala Harris was in Memphis — three weeks ago — representing the White House at the Mississippi Boulevard Christian Church, where thousands came to mourn the 29-year-old young man who at least five Memphis police officers viciously beat, tasered and cursed. A beating caught on camera and so brutal that Nichols died of his injuries three days later. Vice President Harris was not scheduled to speak, but stepped to the podium to offer spontaneous remarks that were empathic and passionate command of the stage. Nobody, including me, should have been surprised to see the vice president in her full woman-in-charge persona, but I’ll admit it felt as though I hadn’t seen her show up that way in a long time. And I miss that Kamala Harris.That Kamala Harris is serving in the third iteration of her "first and only" roles. She was the first woman, the first Asian American and the first African American to be California’s attorney general. She was the second Black woman to be a U.S. senator, but the only one in the Senate when she served. And then at the 2021 inauguration, she assumed her biggest historic role as the first woman, Asian and African American to be vice president of the United States. To get to this high altitude rung of the political ladder, she had to muster up Marvel she-ro superpower, Amazon warrior emotional fortitude and chess master strategy. Yet, there’s been a two years-long strident drumbeat by conservative mouthpieces questioning both her competence and leadership. I recognize the vitriol for what it is: sexist and racist.But, with rare exception, we haven’t seen her out front demonstrating the sharp-edged political talents that made her a standout. The talents that led me — after Hillary Clinton’s defeat — to declare her the best possible hope for a woman president. To be sure, the role of vice president necessarily requires a lower profile so as not to upstage the president. However, she seems to have disappeared. The president assigned her immigration, but on his first trip to the southern border, she was not there. And while the president’s approval ratings are low, hers have plummeted. That’s left her vulnerable to speculation about her place in the administration. GBH’s Margery Eagan recently asked Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren about whether the vice president should be on the Democratic ticket again should President Biden run for a second term. Sen. Warren paused before saying that decision should be left to President Biden, her pause interpreted as disapproval. The senator later insisted that she was in full support of a 2024 Biden/Harris ticket.On the morning after the State of the Union address, Vice President Harris brushed off questions about fading to the back and instead detailed her upcoming busy agenda, including a trip to Munich for a high-level security meeting. She told CBS Gayle King that she was “doing quite well.”Still, I’m resentful that the volume of Vice President Kamala Harris’ voice — if not silenced — has been turned down to a whisper at a time when the issues facing this country are noisy and raucous. Whether it’s her choice or a decision from on high, diminishing her role is not the way to go.', 'category': 'Commentary', 'pubDate': 'Mon, 20 Feb 2023 05:00:01 EST', 'UID': 'ef5e41d391866f815def4ca5d157c513'}, {'title': 'Tributes pour in for former President Jimmy Carter after he enters hospice care', 'link': 'https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/02/20/tributes-pour-in-for-former-president-jimmy-carter-after-he-enters-hospice-care', 'description': 'The one-term Democratic president continued leading a life of public service long after he left the White House.', 'content': 'Online tributes have been rolling in for former President Jimmy Carter, after it was announced that the 98-year-old statesman would enter hospice care at home following a recent series of short hospital stays.Politicians, celebrities, organizations and more have been heaping praise on the one-term Democrat who continued leading a life of public service long after he left the White House."Jimmy Carter is one of the kindest most thoughtful people I\'ve ever had the honor of meeting," comedian and writer Jon Stewart said. "He\'s the best of us."Former comedian-turned-senator Al Franken simply said Carter was the "greatest ex-president. By far."A number of current politicians — both Democrats and Republicans — also celebrated Carter\'s accomplishments.Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee called Carter an "American treasure and icon" and said he was one of the country\'s most caring presidents."From the time he began his service in the United States military and through his presidency, he showed a consciousness of caring," Jackson Lee said.Carter became the 39th U.S. president after he defeated incumbent Republican Gerald Ford in the 1976 election.Over the weekend, presidential historian Michael Beschloss shared a series of photos of Carter on social media, including one during his presidency of Carter in the Oval Office with Joe Biden.Harvard University history professor Annette Gordon-Reed, who wrote The Hemingses of Monticello: An American Family, said she was too young to vote for Carter but supported his campaign by helping to run the group Youth for Carter."I went door-to-door handing out pamphlets, made calls. Thrilled when he won. Knew all his cabinet, watched all his press conferences. Devastated when he lost," Gordon-Reed added.Carter failed to win a second term as president, but his defeat by Republican Ronald Reagan in 1980 did not knock him out of public life.In 1982, he and his wife Rosalynn founded the nonprofit Carter Center, and the one-time president also helped to build homes for the housing organization, Habitat for Humanity — even into his mid-90s."All of us at Habitat for Humanity are lifting up President and Mrs. Carter in prayer as he enters hospice care. We pray for his comfort and for their peace," the organization said.Outside of work, Carter and his wife were also dedicated birders, a hobby the family hatched after a trip to Tanzania in 1988, he told the National Wildlife Federation.The magazine BirdWatching said it was "wishing peace and love to President Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, who have been avid birdwatchers since the late 1980s."

This year, that includes Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and the Celtics coaching staff, led by newly named head coach Joe Mazzulla. Here are five things to know about the coach, who has led the Celtics to a hot start in his few months serving as interim head coach. The Celtics named Mazzulla the interim head coach after the organization suspended Ime Udoka, who had just led the C’s to an NBA Finals appearance in his first year as head coach. Udoka's suspension came after he allegedly had an improper relationship with someone within the Celtics organization. While any sudden move can create challenges for a team, the fact that it took place right before the start of training camp could not have helped the situation. Mazzulla had been on the Celtics coaching staff since 2019 when he got the emergency nod. There are probably better ways to start leading a team than under the shadow of a scandal, but Mazzulla and the Celtics didn’t miss a beat. The team has stormed to a 42-17 record so far—the best in the NBA overall. He was also named the Eastern Conference Coach of the Month for games played in October and November for guiding the C’s to an 18-4 record.After his first win in the season-opener against the Philadelphia 76ers, his team threw him a surprise victory shower. The Celtics rewarded Mazzulla’s success by taking off the interim label on Thursday. In a statement announcing Mazzulla’s new role, Celtics President of Basketball Operations Brad Stevens praised the work Mazzulla had done. “As he has shown, Joe is a very talented coach and leader,” Stevens said. “He has a unique ability to galvanize a room around a mission. We are thankful for the work he has done to help get us to this point, and excited that he has agreed to lead us into the future.”Mazzulla’s promotion also comes with a contract extension. He is now the 19th head coach in franchise history. At only 34 years old, he's two years younger than Celtics big man, Al Horford. Mazzulla will be the coach from the Eastern Conference in this year’s All-Star game, while Michael Malone of the Denver Nuggets gets the nod from the West. Mazzulla is only the third first-year head coach over the last 24 seasons to coach in the All-Star game—and he's the eighth coach in Celtics history to make it to the All-Star game. Unlike in past years, when All-Star teams were split by conference, the NBA has moved to an All-Star Draft format. Mazzulla will coach Team Giannis, led by Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks, who received the most fan votes for All-Star selection among Eastern Conference starters. They’ll face off against Team LeBron, led by none other than the Lakers’ LeBron James. In the draft format, each team will have the ability to select their players from the pool of All-Star starters and reserves regardless of conference. This year, Jayson Tatum is a starter and Jaylen Brown is one of 14 reserves. (It's unclear as of now if Brown, who has a facial contusion, will play in the game.)So there’s a possibility that Mazzulla will coach one of his players, both of his players or perhaps even coach against the duo that have helped make his coaching career blossom. We won’t know until the All-Star draft, which for the first time will take place live right before the game.Mazzulla was born in Johnston, Rhode Island, just a short drive from Providence. He played his high school ball at Bishop Hendricken in Warwick, Rhode Island, where he won three state titles. From there, he went on to play in college at West Virginia.Although this is a big weekend for Mazzulla, he’s not letting the success distract him from the team’s bigger goals. Speaking to the press after the Celtics 127-109 win over the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday, Mazzulla said that he told his players they can’t be too comfortable.“And we have a responsibility to the work that we’ve put in up until this point in the season to raise our level and to play even better than we have been,” he said.The Celtics season resumes Thursday on the road against the Indiana Pacers.", 'category': 'Local', 'pubDate': 'Sun, 19 Feb 2023 12:44:48 EST', 'UID': 'a1b35527a543f6e2393ed98c13b11626'}, {'title': "In 2022, Black farmers were persistently left behind from the USDA's loan system", 'link': 'https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/02/20/in-2022-black-farmers-were-persistently-left-behind-from-the-usdas-loan-system', 'description': 'Farmers do not trust their loan applications will be processed fairly — if they can even file.', 'content': 'Lucious Abrams is the third generation to take over the family Georgia farm, an operation that has long grown cotton, corn, and soybeans. When he did not receive a loan in time to buy the seeds and supplies he needed, he joined the Pigford v. Glickman class action lawsuit against the USDA.The 1999 lawsuit alleged that in myriad ways the agency discriminated against Black farmers resulting in uneven distribution of farm loans and assistance. This caused many Black farmers to lose their land and farms to foreclosure. Pigford plaintiffs, like Abrams, were supposed to receive payments after the case was settled in 1999. However, tens of thousands missed out due to confusing paperwork and filing deadlines and what neared attorney malpractice, advocates say. In 2010, Congress appropriated an additional $1.2 billion in a second round of payouts. But still, many did not receive them due to more denials of claims and deadline and processing issues.But in addition, many say there has to be a larger culture shift at the department because farmers do not trust their loan applications will be processed fairly — if they can even file.Indeed, an NPR analysis of USDA data found that Black farmers receive a disproportionately low share of direct loans given to farmers leaving them behind in a program that is important to their livelihoods. The department itself has long tried to fix these systemic problems, but many farmers and advocates remain skeptical that its efforts will ultimately benefit those who need it most.The USDA\'s lending process, for the last century, is not set up to support nontraditional growers including the farmers of color who face high rejection and withdrawal rates as a result, said Zach Ducheneaux, the Farm Service Agency Administrator at USDA."So it might be you\'re a Black farmer that\'s operating on heirship property who hasn\'t had the benefit of a cooperator technical assistance provider right there on the ground with them to help them navigate this," Ducheneaux said of Black farmers who have owned land for generations but may not know how to navigate USDA\'s processes. "By virtue of the lack of support structure around them, they\'re going to come to the application process less prepared."In 2022, the department granted direct loans to only 36% of farmers who identified as Black, according to an NPR analysis of USDA data that looked at how many direct loan applications were accepted, rejected or withdrawn per each racial group. Direct loans are supposed to be among the easiest to get at USDA. They are meant for farmers who can\'t get credit elsewhere and can be used to get land, farming equipment or other operational costs needed to keep the business afloat.In contrast, 72% of white farmers who applied were approved. Perhaps some of the biggest gaps in the loan demographics can also be seen in the rejection numbers, where 16% of Black farmers were rejected — the highest amount; the corresponding figure for white farmers was 4%. And 48% of Black farmers withdrew their applications, also the highest amount tied with Asian farmers and compared to 24% of white-identifying applicants.By and large, across the first two years of the Biden administration, Black and Asian-identifying farmers were the least successful in acquiring a direct loan, data shows.And it is not just about direct loans. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack has long made the point that farmers of color received less than 1% of coronavirus pandemic farming aid, despite making up 5% of all farmers.Advocates for farmers of color have argued that rejections and withdrawals often happen because the multi-step application process is too cumbersome and confusing. Those whose families have generational experience and long-standing outside resources to navigate the federal bureaucracy sail through. Hmong farmers in Minnesota, for example, may often lease land but they are not given a written contract that they need to qualify for loans, said Janssen Hang, executive director and co-founder of the Hmong American Farmers Association. Farmers keep records and file taxes, but not in a way suitable for the Farm Service Agency, USDA\'s lending branch. And it\'s all complicated by the lack of bilingual federal employees, documents and training materials.In some cases, language barriers are a major issue, including for Hmong American farmers and Hispanic farmers."They can enroll in a farm business management course, but it\'s all conducted in English. And this particular constituency here does not read, read or write English fluently or understand, so they can sign up for the farm business course, pay $2,000 a year just for this course here and what did they walk out with? Stress," Janssen said. "They walk out without any adequate information to really enhance or fund operations here because it is done in a language that they\'re not familiar with."Farmers are also often denied for having low or no credit, despite USDA being considered the "lender of last resort" for producers who cannot get credit elsewhere. The way people are farming is also changing. Urban farms, farms with multiple crops, hemp farms, and others also challenge the loan system which was originally designed for large, one-crop farms.Advocates argued that Vilsack did not do enough to help provide equity and fairness to USDA loan processes during his first term as agriculture secretary under Obama. A 2019 investigation by The Counter found that the department distorted data on Black farmers to paint a rosier picture.The Biden administration vowed to fix the department\'s history, starting with the appointments. The Farm Service Agency is led by Ducheneaux, a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and the first Native American in the role. Prior to being at the department, he served as the executive director of the Intertribal Agriculture Council, an advocacy group for Native American farmers. Indigenous farmers were also a part of their own lawsuit alleging discrimination against USDA and they have long been left out of programs despite having high direct loan acceptance rates."I take that very personally because I\'ve been trying to get them in the door since way before I got here," Ducheneaux said regarding barriers to access to the department that spans across race groups. "My personal goal is to get all of these to as close to 100% as we can."He credits lessons learned in Indian Country for some of the department\'s solutions including working closer with cooperative groups. Using agreements with organizations on the ground that represent different producers, USDA is trying to work through them to get information to farmers."We see this as a chance to leverage the trust that we don\'t have in these communities. In many cases, rightfully so," Ducheneaux said. Agreements spread across young and veteran farmer groups, Hmong American Farmers Association, the Intertribal Agriculture Council and the Federation of Southern Cooperatives.As a result of the agreements, these organizations report being able to increase staff, expand outreach, and increase their ability to give feedback to USDA."Step one of rebuilding trust is acknowledging the fact that we have treated people poorly in the past, and discriminated in the past, and still have practices that feel like active discrimination today," he said. "There is that inherent, intrinsic trust in that NGO or that nonprofit that probably in our lifetime, we\'re never going to rebuild it at the agency or department level. So we\'ve got to start somewhere, and that\'s a great place to begin."In order to reduce the paperwork, speed up decisions and get payments out the department announced this month its plan to shorten the applications from 29 pages to 13.Last year, the department also launched an online program to help producers understand which loans they may qualify for in an effort to reduce the rates of denials and withdrawals. A separate USDA Equity Commission, born out of a Biden executive order calls for federal departments to address racial equity and underserved communities. The group met earlier this month to vote on over 30 recommendations ranging from reducing the number of years of experience needed to participate in conservation programs to making the language in FSA loans more accessible – actions they believe the department can get a head start on. A final report is due by the end of the year.Meanwhile, farmers say they need help and change now.Black farmers who should have gotten relief from Pigford say not all the settlements made it into their hands.And as time passed, interest, delinquent payments and more stacked up against their businesses. "We haven\'t gotten any relief as far as these lawsuits or debt relief, and that will impact me severely," said Rod Bradshaw, a farmer in Kansas, adding that the rising costs of fuel and production are thinning his margins.As a part of the Inflation Reduction Act, the Democrat-led spending bill, members slipped in a provision that created a $3.1 billion debt relief program for "economically distressed borrowers."According to Ducheneaux, the department completed automatic payments towards about 11,000 distressed borrowers who were 60 days or more delinquent on direct and guaranteed USDA loans as of Sept. 30 of last year. USDA data analyzed by NPR shows over 13,000 producers have received a payment on their accounts as of Jan. 30.These payments, however, are to all "distressed farmers," including some white farmers. They may not include all Black farmers. The race-neutral program is an alternative to a lawsuit-blocked race-targeted program first passed by Congress.The bill did include $2.2 billion to the department for farmers who have specifically faced discrimination in USDA lending programs. This money is mandated by Congress to be disbursed by third parties or nongovernmental organizations."We have to be open-minded enough to see if there are some solutions that can be brought to the table that help address some of those cumulative impacts of prior discrimination," said Dewayne Goldmon, the first Senior Advisor for Racial Equity to the Secretary of Agriculture at USDA. "That has to be an important part of the process."In October, the USDA launched a request for information to gather public comments on how to create and implement the program. The comment period closed in November and the department is currently reviewing those submitted."I would consider [the efforts] successful when my position is no longer needed. When you don\'t need an adviser for racial equity," Goldmon said. "And I\'m not being naive, but I have to keep that as a goal."

Woodson There are many things from childhood that Brett Woodson Bailey doesn\'t remember. Maybe it has to do with his cancer diagnosis at 4-years-old, living in the hospital for almost two years, undergoing intense courses of radiation and chemotherapy. He thinks that plays a part in why so much of his childhood is "hazy." Forgetting after all, is a side effect of trauma. But one moment he remembers clearly is his mother, Adele, sitting him down when he was in middle school, telling him that he was the descendent of a famous, important man. You are the great great grandnephew of Carter G. Woodson, she told him. Woodson is the man behind Negro history week, which ultimately became Black History Month. She said Brett should be proud of this fact, he should even brag about it. Brett is not the braggy type. Now 20-years-old, he\'s a soft spoken and thoughtful sophomore at the University of California, Santa Cruz, majoring in environmental science, with dreams of becoming a wildlife biologist. As Brett got older he began to better understand what it means to be related to the man who insisted that we tell, and learn, the true story of Black people in America. In 1926, Woodson created Negro history week, anchoring it between the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass. In the 1970s the week officially expanded to a month. Woodson helped pioneer the field of African American history, especially when it comes to education, and he fiercely believed that Black history should not be a separate, segregated thing, that our histories are intertwined. Brett recognizes his ancestor\'s historical importance, but he doesn\'t know if he feels any personal connection to a man who lived so long ago. "I\'m not exactly like carrying down his legacy too much," he says. But then he stops and turns the idea over mid-sentence. "I guess I kind of am by still being here," he says. "Because you know he was a fighter, fighting for civil rights." Brett knows that surviving is no simple feat, especially when you are Black in America. "I am my ancestors wildest dreams," the aphorism goes. Then there is Brett\'s own experience with cancer — when he was diagnosed he was given a 30% chance of making it. But his people survived and he survived, and that means something. He carries history in his skin and in his bones."If a race has no history, if it has no worthwhile tradition, it becomes a negligible factor in the thought of the world, and it stands in danger of being exterminated." — Carter G. WoodsonGrowing up in the \'40s and \'50s in segregated Kentucky, it was part of Craig Woodson\'s family legend that they could trace their lineage all the way back to the beginnings of American history. There was even a book where the legend was enshrined, a family genealogy. Craig didn\'t read the book, but he knew the story. John and Sarah Woodson crossed the ocean in 1619 from Bristol, England, to settle in the first colony of Jamestown. To start a new life in a new world. One day when John was away and Sarah was at home with their two boys, "there was an Indian attack" Craig recounts. "An attack by the Native Americans and Sarah fended them off with a cast iron pan," recalls Amy Woodson-Boulton. She\'s Craig\'s niece, and grew up with the story too.To protect them, Sarah hid her two children, one underneath the potato bin, and the other in the bathtub. They survived, and from these two sons came the two lines of Woodsons — two genealogical bloodlines to populate the colonized new world. When you met another Woodson you would ask them — tub or potato bin? It\'s the kind of apocryphal lore many families pass down. But this was a white American origin story. And it\'s problematic in the way white American origin stories tend to be, erasing anything but the heroic white point of view, conveniently forgetting the colonization and violence that began the American experiment, ignoring that the new world was not new. But also, because it turns out there weren\'t just "potato-bin Woodsons" and "tub Woodsons." There was another line of Woodsons; one that would lead to Carter G. Woodson, and then, decades later, to Brett Woodson Bailey. That part of the story stayed silent until 1984, when Craig was 41 years old. That year, on Feb. 1, a postage stamp was issued to commemorate the life and work of Carter G. Woodson. It wasn\'t the first time Craig had heard the name, but it was the first time something clicked for him — that this famous Black man shared his last name. "What\'s the deal with the Black Woodsons?" he asked his father. "Who are they?"His dad pointed to the old genealogy book on the family\'s shelf. "It\'s all in there."It was in the first six pages. In 1619, the same year the white Woodsons had settled in Jamestown, a ship carrying around 20 kidnapped Angolans arrived at Point Comfort, in what is now Virginia. The Woodsons bought six of the first Black people who were forcibly trafficked here. They were some of the first American slave owners. "Why did you never tell us this?" Craig demanded of his father. "You never asked," he replied. If forgetting can be a side effect of trauma, what is the side effect of burying the truth? What happens when you bury history in plain sight? "The bondage of the Negro brought captive from Africa is one of the greatest dramas in history, and the writer who merely sees in that ordeal something to approve or condemn fails to understand the evolution of the human race." — Carter G. Woodson Craig has a whole series of past lives. In the late 1960s, he was a part of the short-lived, but influential, avant-garde music group The United States of America, known for its radical politics and psychedelic rock. He played drums for Linda Ronstadt, among others. He got a Ph.D. from UCLA in ethnomusicology, where he studied African drumming and drum making.He says one factor that drew him to African drumming was that it didn\'t come naturally to him, he had to work for it. (A parallel that stands out: Brett — who is a star track athlete — says the same thing about himself and running. He wasn\'t naturally talented at it, he says, but now, running feels like freedom, like flying. And he\'s very good at it.) In 1984, when Craig saw the postage stamp, he had just returned from Ghana, where he was playing music and doing fieldwork. Many of his friends and colleagues were Black. He had no idea what to say to them, just an incredible, bottomless shame he couldn\'t shake.For months he did what he was angry at his family, and his father, for doing. He stayed silent, swallowing the truth. His family wasn\'t just enslavers, they had been "huge slave owners, the first slave owners," he says. "I didn\'t want to face that," he continues. "And that\'s what ultimately brought me to say, I\'ve gotta face it."Finally, one afternoon he confided in a close friend, a woman named Bette Cox, also an ethnomusicologist, who wrote about and researched the music of Black Los Angeles. She didn\'t bat an eye, Craig says. "In her beautiful way, she said, \'Wow, that\'s interesting. My best friend is Aileen Woodson and her husband\'s Edgar. He\'s related to Carter G. — you want to meet them?\' " Within 15 minutes of sharing the story, he found himself standing face to face with Edgar Woodson, the grandnephew of Carter G. Woodson. (And Brett\'s grandfather, although Brett had not been born yet.) This meeting, this story, became a new kind of origin for Craig. It\'s no longer the tub Woodsons and the potato-bin Woodsons, it\'s now a postage stamp and this moment of a white Woodson and a Black Woodson shaking hands, sitting down and talking. Sometimes when Craig tells this story, and he tells it a lot, he gets overrun with emotion. "It\'s powerful," he says. "It\'s one of the most powerful things that ever happened in my life. When you realize something is so easy once you confront it." Craig\'s niece, Amy, says Craig fundamentally changed the way the white Woodsons talked about their past. "He really did help reframe that heroic tale of pioneer survivalist spirit — intrepid people going out to the new world." He broke the myth, she says. It was a myth that needed breaking. But for the Black Woodsons NPR interviewed, the fact that there were white Woodsons who had been enslavers was just that, a fact. They had no myth to break. "That\'s how we have evolved here, as being a part of America," says Patty LaBauve, Edgar\'s niece. "So we\'re a lot more aware of the white lineage, than many of the white Woodsons would be aware of us." When you meet a white person who shares your last name, you know their ancestors probably enslaved your ancestors, LaBauve says. When you are Black, it\'s just a given that you have white relatives. This is why it didn\'t seem strange to her, and to so many other Black Woodsons, to welcome Craig as part of the family. The aim of this generation should be to collect the records of the Negro and treat them scientifically in order that the race may not become a negligible factor in the thought of the world. — Carter G. Woodson"There is no better family than the Woodson family to tell the story of what has happened in this country," says Barbara Dunn, the vice president of membership for ASALH, the Association for the Study of American Life and History, the modern incarnation of the organization Carter G. Woodson founded in 1915. Dunn came to know Craig after he reached out to her, wanting to join ASALH. "When he told me who he was," Dunn says, "I felt like God is really connecting the dots here, you know?" It\'s not just that the Black and white Woodsons tell the story of America\'s past, from the first enslavers to the ship that brought the first Africans to America to the man responsible for Black history month. It\'s that they also give us a possible path forward, Dunn says, a vision of what it might mean to recognize our histories are all tangled up in each other. That Black people are a part of every American origin story. The exact kind of history for which Carter G. Woodson fought. Both Edgar and Aileen, who Craig first sat down with in their living room in the mid 1980s, have long since died. But their daughter, Adele Woodson Bailey, Brett\'s mom, says it\'s important to know that the bond that grew between their families did not happen overnight. At first she was skeptical. "How important do you think your family is to us?" she wondered of this white man, coming in trying to claim some deep connection. "You can\'t just show up and say we are cousins," she remembers thinking. But then a funny thing happened. "As time went on we met more often. Started going to funerals and weddings and got to know one another." "He made an effort," she says, and her family made an effort in return. Now she thinks of Craig as not just family, but as close family. Real family. Like blood. "That\'s cousin Craig," says Patty LaBauve (also Adele\'s cousin, for those trying to keep the family tree straight). "We claim him as our cousin," she says. "I just call him my cousin," Brett says. "Maybe in the back of my head, I thought it was kind of weird that he was white." Brett didn\'t really have any other white cousins. But since he as born after Craig had already become part of the family, Craig was just there. When Brett was a baby, he was there. When Brett was sick with cancer, he was there. Craig taught Brett how to drive, took him to the DMV to get his license. Adele has struggled with illness, and Craig was always one of the people Brett could call. When Brett was in middle school, around the same time Adele sat him down and told him he was related to Carter G. Woodson, she showed him a video. In it, his cousin Craig was standing in front of his family and apologizing. "I don\'t feel like apologizing is the right word," Brett says. "But just trying to make amends in a way." Craig does call it an apology; an apology made at a reconciliation ceremony he organized with Edgar in 1998. He wanted to do something formal. He wanted to take responsibility for the sins of his forefathers. But first he had to get his family on board. Let truth destroy the dividing prejudices of nationality and teach universal love without distinction of race, merit or rank. — Carter G. WoodsonThere was a little resistance, sometimes more than a little resistance, from some of the white Woodsons. "Why do you need to do this?" some asked. "What\'s the big deal, why can\'t you just let it go?" Those were the questions that came from members of Craig\'s politically liberal white family. They didn\'t see the point in dredging up the past. Joan Woodson, Craig\'s sister-in-law, says some relatives were worried that they were going to be attacked. "Are we going there and then everybody\'s going to be yelling and screaming at us as white people?" she remembers some asking. Craig reassured them that it wasn\'t going to be like that. He doesn\'t think everyone believed him, but in the end "they all showed up anyway," he says. The reconciliation ceremony took place on a Sunday after services at Holman United Methodist Church in Los Angeles. It was Edgar and Aileen\'s church and the pastor at the time was Rev. James Lawson, a civil rights icon and confidant of Martin Luther King Jr., although Lawson wasn\'t present that day. Craig and Edgar had also invited Sam Appiah, known as Nana Osei Tutu for his role as leader of the Asante people in the United States. Craig knew Appiah through his connection with the Asante Cultural Society in Los Angeles, and he agreed to come and speak about his ancestors\' participation in the slave trade."I represented an original enslaver," Craig says. "Edgar represented the original enslaved, and the African side of it was represented by Sam Appiah, and his Asante lineage." There was African drumming, and colleagues from UCLA. Other white Woodsons spoke. Craig\'s sister brought a clock made with light and dark wood, joined together, as a gift. "It\'s about time," she said. Edgar, a quiet man who everyone listened to when he did speak, also got up. "Those things that have happened in the past, we must recognize them and not put them aside," he said. "We must recognize that they have influenced us, and if there is going to be a change in our behavior we must recognize why we are changing or why we should change." Then it was Craig\'s turn. "I apologize, on behalf of my ancestors for the holocaust that was caused to your family and your ancestors. And I ask for your forgiveness." Craig stepped down off of the dais and walked down the aisle towards Edgar, who stood to greet him. Then the white descendant of one of the first enslavers in America and the Black descendant of the man who helped establish the study of Black history — embraced. Craig felt a relief, a lifting of weight. When it was Adele\'s time to speak she admitted she had been skeptical. "I thought it was going to be a really superficial kind of meeting," she told the room. But the apologies actually moved her, made her feel validated. "It lifted a little of my cynicism," she confessed. "I\'m not going to pretend it wasn\'t awkward," says Amy Woodson-Boulton. As Joan\'s daughter and Craig\'s niece, Amy was a generation younger, and it felt a little bit formal, a little bit of a forced. "I think those of us — Black and white — who were in our twenties, kind of got together and were like, this is weird," she says. "This is kind of awkward and strange." One of the things that stood out to Amy was that the Black Woodsons were hosting them. Aileen and other ladies from their church put out a huge spread of food for everyone. It was plentiful and delicious, and they were lovely, generous hosts. But "here we were not giving back," Amy says. "They were giving to us. So I think that was almost another layer of strangeness." Even in all that strangeness, they made inroads of connection. Adele and Amy hit it off, and they stayed in touch as they both became mothers, and both of their children had health issues.They kept track of each other\'s lives via Facebook, but as Amy used the app less, their connection dwindled a bit. It happens. "We\'re still sometimes in touch," Adele says. "But Craig and I definitely are." The two had just had a disagreement, she told me. A family squabble. "We\'re family for real," she says, laughing. "If you can control a man\'s thinking, you don\'t have to worry about his actions. If you can determine what a man thinks you do not have to worry about what he will do." — Carter G. WoodsonSome Woodsons are connected by name. "When slavery ended, they did take on the enslaver\'s name," says ASALH\'s Barbara Dunn of the Woodson family. Dunn\'s family had done something different, following an old African tradition, taking their father\'s first name as their surname. There was one line that kept their enslaver\'s name, Devereux. "We have since found they really were Devereux," she says, "because one of the enslavers produced a child." Maybe, she says, that\'s why the Black Woodsons kept the name. "Maybe they really were Woodsons," Dunn says. Craig is very open when it comes to talking about race, about whiteness, about the horrors of slavery. But this part is still difficult for him, and for others, to be really open about. How any genetic connection he has to Black Woodsons is probably through sexual violence, through rape. "We just didn\'t really talk about it," Craig says. It wasn\'t that they didn\'t understand it was a possibility. It is just a hard thing. Michelle Evans-Oliver was on a zoom call with Craig when she found out they were related, a DNA test detecting just enough overlap to suggest genetic ties. Evans, the head of the Richmond, Va., branch of ASALH, and a serious amateur genealogist in her own right, says while it\'s family lore that the Woodsons in her family tree are related to Carter G. Woodson, she hasn\'t been able to prove it with a paper trail, yet. But she is related to Craig, by thin strands of DNA. Evans-Oliver says being a Black American makes genealogy harder, more complex, thornier. Her family has no book dating all the way back to 1619. "If I was white, I would be able to trace it all the way back," she says. To learn about your family by searching through the wills of enslavers and the graveyards of the enslaved, you realize you are never that far from a history of violence, she says. "You have to really find out who enslaved your family in order to find out who your father was at that point, if you know who your grandfather was, if he was white." Evans-Oliver thinks she and Craig look a bit alike, something in the eyes, maybe the nose. There\'s a picture of them, from when they first met, before they knew they were related, wearing the same glasses. "He\'s a Woodson, I\'m a Woodson," she says. "How did we both get to be Woodsons?" "If you think about it hard," she says, "it makes you stop and say, \'Wow.\' " Not to signify wonder. Maybe more a recognition of the trauma that lives in the bonds between them. Evans-Oliver wasn\'t there at the formal reconciliation ceremony. "I was a baby back then," she says, laughing. But on the same zoom where they found out they had matching DNA, Craig made another apology, one specifically to her. She appreciates that he was willing to own up to the past, to name it and claim it. That\'s rare, she says. She\'s found many white people want to dodge and duck history. "The only way we can get over what went on is if we face it head on," she says. It\'s the same thing Craig says. But Evans-Oliver also knows one man\'s apology is not enough. "It\'s easier for him to get over it," she says. "More so than for us. We still live with it.""So yeah, he could come to terms with it. \'Oh, let me do a reconciliation ceremony. We\'re going to make this thing happen and we\'re going to apologize, and then we\'re going to move forward,\' but it\'s more to it than that." "Why haven\'t we been able to do this more publicly in the United States?" she asks. Not just apologize, but talk publicly about what real repair would look like. "What about the other Craig Woodsons of the world?" In the decades since Craig\'s formal apology racism hasn\'t gone away, structural inequity hasn\'t been fixed. White supremacy is thriving. Small moments of reconciliation between individuals might be nice, they might even be necessary to heal, but they don\'t change the larger systems, Evans-Oliver says. "I\'m only three generations out of slavery," she says. "At most 150 years. It\'s not that far away." "Real education means to inspire people to live more abundantly, to learn to begin with life as they find it and make it better." — Carter G. Woodson What does it mean to heal the past?NPR asks Brett Woodson this question as he sits on the University of California, Santa Cruz college campus. "To heal the past?" he asks. "How do you even start?" Brett has gone through more than most 20-year-olds. Part of that is surviving cancer. There is the friend he made when he was undergoing treatment as a child. "She was probably my closest friend," he says. She had a brain tumor, more lethal than his kind of cancer. "I lost her," Brett says. Living in the hospital for over a year while going through chemo and radiation messed up his social skills, he thinks. He believes it\'s one of the reasons he\'s so shy, slower to make friends.On the one hand, Brett sees Craig as a really good guy who has always been there for him. For Brett, his older white cousin is living proof our ancestors don\'t define us. On the other hand, as a young Black man, he understands the way legacies of racism live on, the way it can limit and yes, even define, people\'s possibilities. "There are still repercussions today from what happened in the past," he says. What he doesn\'t say: If you are Black. Brett is aware that people sometimes cross the street when they see him. "It could just be because I stand out," he says. "It\'s rare to see a Black person on campus." Just less than 5% of the students at UCSC are Black, which to be fair, Brett points out, is an improvement from previous years. That too, he knows, is a legacy of racism. When the "reckoning" around race happened in 2020, Brett says he felt a lot of his white peers were going through the motions, posturing and posting. But all that talk of racial justice didn\'t really last, he says. "I\'m not hearing any of them talk about it now," he says. "I\'m not hearing them talk about the scarcity of Black people on college campuses." Brett says he doesn\'t really feel connected to the legacy of his great great great granduncle, Carter G. Woodson. But he talks about the importance of education for Black people, all the time. When he talks about racial justice, it is often through the lens of more equitable access to education. Just like his ancestor. "Let us banish fear. We have been in this mental state for three centuries. I am a radical. I am ready to act, if I can find brave men to help me." — Carter G. WoodsonCraig knows his apology wasn\'t enough. "It\'s not something that you can say I\'m sorry for, because it\'s too enormous," he says. "It\'s too profound." He now believes apologizing was something he did more to heal himself, than for the Black Woodsons. You can\'t apologize for the violence of slavery, not really, Craig says. But you can show up. If you\'re lucky, Craig says, you might find that the people your ancestors have wronged are willing to listen, to let you say "I\'m sorry." To unburden your soul a little. If you\'re really lucky, they will welcome you into their family. But that takes something beyond apology. It takes being honest about our intertwined histories. It takes the work of a lifetime. NPR asked Craig if he ever talked with the Black Woodsons about monetary reparations. His family benefitted from their ancestors violently forced labor, after all. Craig said it never really came up. But recently he put Brett in his will. He says it was something that should\'ve happened a long time ago. NPR asked Brett if Craig\'s showing up for him, and for Adele, was a kind of reparations. "I guess in a way it depends on your perspective," Brett says. "It could be a kind of reparations, whether it\'s intentional or unintentional." "You could view it as him making up for his ancestors," he says. "Or you could just view it as him being a good cousin. It depends on the way you frame it." For Brett, seeing their relationship solely through the lens of repairing the past ignores the real connection they\'ve established in the present. The one that holds Brett and Craig and Adele, and all the other Woodsons, together. The one that keeps them showing up. If trauma can make us forget, can remembering help us heal? Maybe it can. Maybe it can\'t. Still we owe it to history to remember, Craig says. We owe it to each other.

Her decision on Friday crushed the City Council's effort to implement the change, which nearly 80% of Boston voters supported in 2021, the same year Wu was elected mayor.“I deeply respect that the proponents of this proposal are motivated by a commitment to supporting Boston’s young people — a commitment I share with urgency,” Wu said in a letter explaining her rationale. “Respectfully, I cannot support legislative changes that would compromise our ability to stabilize and support the Boston Public Schools during this critical period.”Wu’s move came 48 hours after the City Council narrowly advanced the proposal to her office on a 7–5 vote. Councilor Kenzie Bok voted present, effectively abstaining from the controversy.The measure, a home rule petition, needed the mayor’s blessing to continue to the State House and the governor’s office.Councilor Ricardo Arroyo, who led the effort to bring the home rule petition, called the mayor’s veto “disappointing” given that there’s broad agreement the current mayor-appointed school committee structure needs reform.“I know all of us — the mayor included — are united in making our public schools the best in the country and I do believe a governing change to the School Committee would help us get closer to that goal while empowering our school families and stakeholders,” Arroyo said in a statement.Boston maintains the state’s largest public school system, and it’s the only school committee in the state of Massachusetts that is appointed by the mayor rather than being democratically elected.The shift to an appointed school committee was made in 1992 under then-Mayor Ray Flynn. Advocates for the return to an elected school committee have characterized the issue as one of civil rights and racial justice, a view referenced in a statement from Lisa Green, chair of the Bostonians for an Elected School Committee coalition. “We believe the time is always right to do justice,” Green’s statement said. “99,000 voters demanded an end to Mayoral Control of Boston Schools in the last municipal election. The mayor today confirmed that she refuses to be held accountable to those voters, saying now is not the time.”Green vowed to keep the issue alive and said the committee is exploring a possible campaign for a binding ballot referendum.Wu has consistently opposed a fully elected committee but has at times seemed open to the ideas of a so-called hybrid model made up of mayoral appointees and popularly elected members.

It\'s no secret Andrea Joy Campbell was Healey\'s top pick to succeed her in that role. Now, with just a few weeks under her belt as attorney general, Campbell is considering a similar national strategy."I think it\'s critical," Campbell told host Callie Crossley on GBH\'s Basic Black. "What I\'ve told folks is we can focus on all the issues here. We have significant work to do, but it would be a missed opportunity if we weren\'t showing up nationally."Campbell said other states look to Massachusetts when establishing laws and best practices on issues such as criminal law reform and police accountability. "These are areas where we will lead," Campbell said. "And we should be talking about how we\'re doing it nationally while balancing local concerns. We can do both." Healey and Campbell formed a tight bond that was put on display during their time campaigning together. How will Campbell, the people\'s lawyer, now hold Gov. Healey\'s office accountable? The attorney general made it clear: "I\'m accountable to the people, not the legislature, not the governor. I don\'t answer to them. I answer to the people." Campbell has been settling into her role, beginning largely with internal meetings to outline top priorities and messaging. Campbell noted gun enforcement, reproductive rights, protecting vulnerable communities, housing and environment as major highlights her office is working on. She called Massachusetts a leader on progressive policies relating to issues such as guns and abortion, and called her job the best in the country for being in a position to provide quick solutions to some of the most pressing issues. Campbell said she\'s already had to file briefs taking on people who want to challenge the state\'s gun laws and assault weapons ban. "I think this is our opportunity to be bold and courageous. As we see more shootings, more gun violence in this country, residents are expecting AGs to step up and I\'m going to do just that."

The controversy hit its peak following the murder of George Floyd in May 2020, when leadership rewrote a statement drafted by its communications team without consulting any of its Black subcommittee members. Public fury ensued, and instead of hearing out calls for change and reshuffling leadership, the board dissolved itself in 2021, subsequently putting the annual parade on hold. Now, the organization Boston Pride For The People is taking the reins and is promising to do better for this year’s parade, which will be held on June 10 at the Boston Common. The group includes community leaders and members from other LGBTQ+ organizations, including Pride for the People, which was founded to center people of color in Pride planning.Jo Trigilio, vice president of the new organization and longtime LGBTQ+ activist, says the new board is working hard to ensure members of all communities feel welcome and included at the event.“Since the very beginning, we have been really focused on creating a community-centered pride,” says Trigilio. “That means being really intentional about thinking about everyone who needs to be included and how we create space for everyone.” Trigilio says Pride For The People’s efforts will also extend to those who may need physical accommodations to enjoy the event, including sober areas, quiet spaces and accommodations for older members of the LGBTQ+ community.“We’re listening to a lot of voices and getting input on what people need to feel included and make the day a choice one for them,” they say. Despite the new leadership and promises of inclusion, Julia Golden, interim president of Trans Resistance Massachusetts, says they still haven’t heard the new organizers say much about race or gender.“This is a missed opportunity to allow people to see what the new center is about,” they say. “Can we talk about, you know, trans, Black, Latino, queer, non-binary and trans experiences? I’m just not hearing it.”And Golden says the buck doesn’t stop with new leadership and a new mission, they argue complete financial transparency is needed. Trigilio said Pride for the People hopes to raise around $750,000 to fund the event. “We know several marches in Boston run for under $100,000,” said Golden, “so to hear significant numbers trying to be raised, it’s like, there are so many other nonprofits that are specifically giving back to trans, queer, marginalized populations that could really use the help, rather than one day of a Pride parade.” “I think that what a lot of us are starting to realize is [that] Pride is great, and a parade can be really fun and bring [the] community together, but at the expense of who?” they added. “How can we celebrate people and also help people?”Trigilio said that although their focus is on the community, a massive event like Boston Pride needs significant funding to support the number of attendees — the event draws hundreds of thousands of people to downtown Boston — and increased accessibility. That also means seeking out corporate sponsorship.“That just means, you know, [we have to] do our homework and make sure that the corporations that you’re working with are socially responsible with respect to LGBTQ issues and racial equity issues,” they say. “Basically be intentional about avoiding companies that engage in ‘rainbow washing.’”Golden said the biggest takeaway is that celebrating queer pride should be more than an annual parade and serve the entire community. “My hope,” Golden says, “is that we start receiving community feedback and being asked to be a part of what the next iteration [will] look like.”SeparatorClarification: This story was updated to clarify the relationship between Boston Pride For The People and Pride for the People.
