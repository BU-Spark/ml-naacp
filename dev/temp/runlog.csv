0,'A lot of bang for your buck' with jail-based arts programs,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/05/01/a-lot-of-bang-for-your-buck-with-jail-based-arts-programs,Researchers have found a correlation between making art in U.S. jails and prisons and improved mental health.,"On Mondays, Eddie takes a macroeconomics class at 9:00 a.m. Then at 1:00 p.m., he takes a course on statistics and probability. Eddie also studies French, and exercises daily.Eddie has been living in the Franklin County Jail in Greenfield, Massachusetts, since before the pandemic. His sentence is up in about two years, For privacy reasons, he asked that we not use his last name.A large part of his day is spent in a shared cell with a bunk bed, desk, toilet and sink. Many of the courses he takes are virtual, and being allowed to use a tablet in this jail is not automatic. It's an earned privilege.Once a week, in person, Eddie takes guitar lessons.“It gives me something to do,” he said. “And on top of that, music is something that helps a person. They say it enhances our mental capacity and ability.”Eddie is part of an intermediate group lesson and in the past few weeks has focused on the minor pentatonic scales. James — who also asked to keep his identity private — is using a Fender guitar someone donated to the program.""I had been dabbling with a guitar for like probably three years, but it wasn't structured,” James said.That was before getting arrested. James has been at the Franklin County Jail for a year and a half, awaiting sentencing. Playing guitar, he said, helps him keep his mind off things.“I think definitely understanding myself and playing guitar go hand in hand,” James said.He wouldn’t talk about why he was arrested. Neither would Eddie.It’s a topic their guitar teacher Michael Nix, a professional musician, never asks about.“It’s a personal thing they can share with me if they want,” Nix said, “but I really don't care.”What Nix does care about, like any music teacher, is that his students practice and learn. But given the setting, Nix said, it's more than that.“What I care about is forming positive relationships, where as a mentor I can ask people to operate at the same kind of high level that I ask myself to operate at [as a musician],"" Nix said.Nix started teaching guitar at the Franklin County Jail in the months before the pandemic shut down in-person activities. Now he meets with about a dozen students — some are long-term, he said, and some he sees once and they don't return. He doesn't always find out why.Guitar lessons are offered only to people who are locked up in a particular unit of the Franklin County Jail.To be able to stay in the unit, James said you have to step up, volunteer and go to regular community meetings.""We’re held to a higher standard,” he said. ”We gotta do well.”Even with incentives like more free time or extra Netflix, James said not everyone takes advantage of the different courses — or the therapy.Franklin County Sheriff Christopher Donelan said the crimes that bring people to his jail come out of childhood trauma and mental health issues. In the last decade, the opioid epidemic has pushed law enforcement to look at what it means to jail someone with addiction.""The science tells us that addiction is a disease,” Donelan said. “And we're failing ourselves if we think that we can just contain men and women with substance abuse issues in a jail, and then release them and think that anything's going to change or improve.”Not everyone in the U.S. corrections system agrees that men and women convicted of a crime should be able to participate in music lessons or art classes, but Donelan said he thinks most victims of crime are satisfied with the fact that the perpetrator is behind bars.""The bottom line is, as I tell [employees], it's not our job to punish. That's the judge's job,"" Donelan said. ""The judge sends them to us. Our job is to correct behavior and offer opportunities for a better life of not committing crimes.""Researchers have found a correlation between making art in U.S. jails and prisons and social skill development and improved mental health. For people who are incarcerated, corrections officials say that translates to learning how to work out the kinks in social settings — with family and employers, and to longevity in the workplace or staying with their therapy or drug treatment.This progressive approach is used at county jails around Massachusetts, Donelan said. Data from Franklin County, he said, show some promising results.""There was a 27% reduction in recidivism over a three-year cohort from 2015 to 2018,"" Donelan said, looking at the jail's first cohort in its cognitive behavioral therapy program.“Corrections professionals realize that there's a lot of bang for your buck with these programs,” said Wayne Kramer, the founder of the proto-punk band MC5.“If they don't do something to help people change for the better, the prison experience itself will change them for the worse,” Kramer said.Kramer speaks from experience. He was arrested in 1975 for selling cocaine to an undercover federal agent. While he was incarcerated in Kentucky, The Clash wrote a song about Kramer and a few other musicians in their B-side single ""Jail Guitar Doors."" Kramer is mentioned in the first verse.""Let me tell you 'bout Wayne and his deals of cocaineA little more every dayHolding for a friend till the band do wellThen the D.E.A. locked him away...""Twenty or so years after Kramer was released, he and British singer-songwriter Billy Bragg used the song title for starting two organizations — one in the U.S. and one in the U.K., — that get musical instruments into the hands of incarcerated men and women.Kramer's organization, with the motto ""saving lives one guitar at a time,"" is being used in jails and state prisons in California, Arizona, Texas and other states.""We've participated in longitudinal studies where we have empirical evidence that people that participate in arts-in-corrections programing have lower recidivism rates,"" Kramer said.In Los Angeles County Men's Jail, Kramer himself teaches songwriting workshops.""What they learn right away is how to collaborate with someone that they might not normally hang out with,"" Kramer said. ""They might not be from their neighborhood or might not have the same skin color [or] they might speak Spanish.""What inevitably happens, Kramer said, is they find out they have much more in common than different. He's witnessed remarkable connections made between incarcerated men from from rival gangs, Kramer said, because they're playing and writing music together.“I've had guys tell me, ‘Wayne, you know that dude? I never liked him. I'd see him on the yard. I don't like him. But, you know, we worked on that song together and he's all right,’” Kramer said.At the Franklin County Jail, Eddie and others are allowed to keep their guitars with him, even after class.He’s been battling depression for years, he said, and playing helps him. There’s one song he recently learned that soothes him.“Like, I close my eyes, I'm out in the zone somewhere and it just relaxes me almost as a mother, singing to a child,” Eddie said.The song is a lullaby written by Sting, but Eddie first heard it at the end of ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2.""Deep in the meadow, under the willowA bed of grass, a soft green pillowLay down your head, and close your sleepy eyesAnd when again they open, the sun will rise.Here it's safe, here it's warmHere the daisies guard you from every harmHere your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings them trueHere is the place where I love you.Eddie plays it over and over, he said. He's good enough that no one asks him to stop. It may even be soothing to others who hear him.""The last two or three cell mates that I had, basically I play guitar while they're in there,"" Eddie said. ""And because they're in there, I usually kind of play soft. And strangely, they all end up sleeping where I'm playing.""Nix, the guitar teacher, said when people make music together, it's one of the most healthy social interactions. And being able to learn a piece, he said, is a big self-esteem boost — something that could help them live a better life, once they're out of jail.",Local,"Mon, 01 May 2023 05:00:43 EST",797f063d7c9f11bff88fc398616ad78a,NARENDRA MODI,"[('Blessed', 0.3446859121322632), ('Martin Seligman', 0.311862587928772), ('Bay Hill Club & Lodge', 0.3091067373752594), ('Sonja Lyubomirsky', 0.30794966220855713), ('Bengen', 0.3070281744003296), ('Star Jones', 0.29812708497047424), ('North Korea', 0.2979793846607208), ('The Brookings Institution', 0.29656147956848145), ('the Royal & Ancient Golf Club', 0.29602769017219543), ('Cal Crutchlow', 0.29597458243370056)]",ENTERTAINMENT,"[('The Joffrey Ballet School', 0.3478420376777649), ('Ron Chernow', 0.326853483915329), ('Kim Westad', 0.31515780091285706), ('Old Orchard Shopping Center', 0.3077217638492584), ('Savoy', 0.3011496067047119), ('Bill Condon', 0.3011067807674408), ('East Colfax', 0.2980639636516571), ('6th Avenue', 0.2938918471336365), ('The Zurich Chess Challenge', 0.2902977466583252), ('ISEE', 0.29013970494270325)]",SOCCER,"[('ALK Airlines', 0.32841286063194275), ('Clio Cup', 0.30741599202156067), ('BOSTON', 0.3071383237838745), ('Judy Lehmberg', 0.3056601881980896), ('Toulon-Hyeres', 0.30000635981559753), ('SF71H', 0.2999483346939087), ('Zero Hora', 0.29877448081970215), ('Sport Italia', 0.2925058901309967), ('Selección Colombia', 0.2914760112762451), (""Andrea Barzagli's"", 0.29108282923698425)]",ANIMALS,"[('World Golf Championship', 0.3212679922580719), ('Paul Shapiro', 0.27384209632873535), ('TPC Cromwell', 0.27357736229896545), ('a Jump Tower', 0.2706485390663147), ('post-Tour Championship', 0.26720374822616577), ('Daniel Chopra', 0.26637041568756104), (""Caustic's"", 0.2651982307434082), ('Tim Finchem', 0.2646767497062683), ('Caustic', 0.25985556840896606), ('A Military Tribute at The Greenbrier', 0.25917983055114746)]"
1,More people are getting away with murder. Unsolved killings reach a record high,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/05/01/more-people-are-getting-away-with-murder-unsolved-killings-reach-a-record-high,"More murders across America are going unsolved, exacerbating the grief of families already reeling and worsening the largely cracked trust between police and the public, especially communities of color most affected by gun violence.","More murders across America are going unsolved, exacerbating the grief of families already reeling and worsening the largely cracked trust between police and the public, especially communities of color most affected by gun violence. ""I haven't had any word,"" says Mark Legaspi about the murder of his cousin, friend and business partner Artgel Anabo Jr., 39, who was known as Jun. He was shot just outside their popular Filipino fast-food restaurant Lucky Three Seven in East Oakland, Calif., May 18, 2022. ""It's still emotional every day coming in here, you know?"" Legaspi says nodding toward the street where Jun was murdered.Oakland detectives released security camera footage and the license plate number of the suspected get-away car. Anabo's family believes the suspect is a man who sold Anabo a truck that turned out to be stolen. Still, there's been no break in the case and no word. ""It's definitely frustrating. Justice hasn't been served,"" Legaspi says. ""I mean it's almost a year. I would like to know something. I don't get no answers,"" he says noting that he and his family haven't heard from Oakland homicide detectives for months. ""You know, if there's anything, you know, even if they didn't do anything, that'd be nice to know. Instead of us hoping."" The U.S. among the worst at solving murders in the industrialized worldLegaspi's frustration and pain are shared by hundreds of families of murder victims in Oakland – and across the country – whose cases remain unsolved. While the rate at which murders are solved or ""cleared"" has been declining for decades, it has now dropped to slightly below 50% in 2020 - a new historic low. And several big cities, including Chicago, have seen the number of murder cases resulting in at least one arrest dip into the low to mid-30% range. ""We saw a sharp drop in the national clearance rate in 2020,"" says Prof. Philip Cook, a public policy researcher and professor emeritus at Duke University and the University of Chicago Urban Labs who has been studying clearance rates for decades. ""It reached close to 50% at that time nationwide, which was the lowest ever recorded by the FBI. And it hasn't come up that much since then.""That makes the U.S. among the worst at solving murders in the industrialized world. Germany, for example, consistently clears well over 90% of its murders. While reasons behind the drop are multi-faceted, Cook and other experts warn that more people getting away with murder in the the U.S. is driving a kind of doom loop of mutual mistrust: low murder clearance rates impede future investigations which in turn potentially drive up killings in some communities where a lack of arrests undermines deterrence and sends a message that the police will not or cannot protect them. ""Communities that are especially impacted by gun violence believe that the police are ineffective or indifferent, and as a result, they're less willing to cooperate and provide information the police need to have successful investigations,"" says Cook, who has several research articles on the topic coming out. ""It is undermining whatever trust there is in the police. And it's a vicious circle,"" Cook says.""I certainly don't believe in anyone getting away with murder""Oakland, Calif., is a prime example of that vicious circle. The city's per capita homicide rate remains abnormally high and its murder solve rate is among the lowest in the nation, hitting just 36% last year. If you take out the handful of older, ""cold"" cases that were solved during 2022, the clearance rate in Oakland just 27%, an analysis by the S.F. Chronicle shows. ""Well, I certainly don't believe in anyone getting away with murder. These cases are never closed,"" says Drennon Lindsey, an Oakland deputy chief who formerly led the department's homicide division. ""We never give up, you know. And I also think we can only get better."" Lindsey says the veterans among her 16 detectives are often handing two dozen or more cases at a time, far above the federal recommendation that detectives carry an average of only four to six new homicide cases per year. In addition, she says, an antiquated case management data system, which the city is working to replace, is another reason behind the painfully low clearance rate. But the biggest one, she says, is too many people are scared to talk with and help the OPD. ""People don't want to cooperate, people don't want to come to court and testify. And they're afraid of retaliation, of being labeled in their communities as a ""snitch."" And we're often left trying to plea and beg for the community to come forward with information to hold this person accountable for committing murder,"" she says. But that mistrust is also bred by the department's chronic dysfunction. The department remains under federal oversight and has for two decades. In that time the troubled agency has gone through a dozen leaders. And recently veteran Oakland homicide detective Phong Tran was arrested and arraigned after the Alameda County district attorney's office accused him of paying a witness thousands of dollars to lie in a murder case that resulted in two men getting life sentences. Detective Tran faces felony charges of perjury and bribery. Those two murder convictions have been tossed out. In a statement to NPR, Tran's attorney Andrew M. Ganz called the charges ""baseless"" and lashed out a District Attorney Pamela Price for treating ""murderers like heroes."" Price's office in a statement says it is now reviewing at least 125 murders Tran investigated ""to see if we have wrongfully convicted anyone else.""""Lying and manipulating a witness are serious violations of the public trust and a threat to the integrity of the judicial system,"" Price says. ""When the integrity of a conviction is at issue in one case, it raises questions in every other case that the detective has investigated.""The ""exceptional means"" clause and chronic police staffing affect murder clearance rates The FBI defines a murder ""cleared"" if a suspect has been identified and arrested. But a murder can also be declared cleared through what's known as an ""exceptional means."" For example, if a suspect is dead, can't be extradited or prosecutors refuse to press charges. So, criminologists note, even some cities now touting modestly improved murder clearance rates, such as Chicago, are really just artificially boosting their clearance numbers through that ""exceptional means"" clause.The arrest rate per murder if is often a better indicator of how police departments are actually doing at holding killers accountable. Prof. Cook's research, for example, shows that from 2016 to 2020 the percentage of murders in Chicago with any type of weapon resulting in at least one arrest was just 33%. And in Durham, North Carolina, between 2017 and 2021 just 41% of gun homicide cases resulted in at least one arrest. Other reasons for the further decline in murder clearance rates, experts say, include chronic police staffing and recruiting problems, and the fact that more murders are committed with firearms, which can result in fewer witnesses and less physical evidence. In addition, judges, prosecutors and juries have higher evidence and procedure standards than in the 1960s when 90-plus% of homicides were listed as solved. Researchers say key ways cities can to try to stop the downward spiral is simply investing more in homicide investigations: improving crime labs, training, DNA testing, computer modeling systems. White crosses with the names and ages of the dead grows with every killingIn front yard of Oakland's Saint Columba Catholic Church along bustling San Pablo Ave, a garden of simple, wooden, white crosses with the names and ages of the dead grows with every killing. Every Jan. 1 ""that garden is a garden for about a minute,"" says Fr. Aidan McAleenan, St Columba's pastor looking at the roughly two dozen crosses already posted in the yard. ""And then is just gets grows and grows"" all year. ""My biggest concern, and I prayed about this, there are about 100 people walking around Oakland now who will not be walking around Oakland at the end of the year,"" McAleenan says. Parishioner Rich Laufenberg makes the wooden crosses and dutifully ""plants"" them every week or two. ""I do it as some kind of service work, I hope, and to let people know that we have a major violence problem here in Oakland,"" he says. Regularly, Laufenberg says when placing the crosses he'll find family or friends of a victim praying or just gazing in stunned silence at the lives cut short""They'll stop and look and strike up a conversation and they mention not infrequently that the relative whose cross they're looking at, that case, hasn't been solved yet."" At Oakland's Lucky Three Seven Filipino restaurant, owner Mark Legaspi says he doesn't blame Oakland detectives, per se, for not solving his cousin's murder. They're overworked and overwhelmed, he says. But he wants answer. And so does his murdered cousin's son, Kiah, now 12 who was super tight with his dad. Kiah was right next to his dad when the gunman attacked. ""He saw everything. I'm just glad he ran the other way instead of following his dad. You know, because he could have got caught in the line of fire,"" Legaspi says. ""Obviously, as a kid, seeing that, your superhero dad, you know, that will always have problem with you know, like inside,"" he says. Anabo's son is doing OK, given the circumstances, he says. He's making the Honor Roll and trying to stay positive. ""Just got to keep that love with him every day, you know.""The family plans to honor Anabo with a gathering at the restaurant on the upcoming May 18 anniversary of his murder. But they'd rather celebrate a break in his case.

We asked our readers to share their optimistic strategies and they really, really did — nearly 100 wonderful responses. Stay optimistic! Here's a selection of the themes and thoughts and thank you to everybody who wrote in.The humor connectionHumor continues to be one of the things that gives me hope. No matter how hard life can get, there are always people who find a way to make things feel lighter. It could be as simple as silly viral animal videos or the more complex comedy that contextualizes our lives in the broader arc of history. Either way, we as humans tend to know when we need to break the tension and give ourselves a mental reset. -Eric Conrad, Washington, D.C.I don't think I could live in this world without humor. It's best when it is shared. It connects us to our loved ones but even brings us closer to strangers. Haven't you ever glanced across a room, caught someone's eye and shared a smile with a total stranger over a funny incident? It's understanding the human condition. We're still in this together. -Joy Stephenson, Gainesville, Fla.A simple grinI feel like I'm in a chronic state of despair over the various bad situations all over the planet, with my personal struggles on top of them. But several years ago, I walked into a hardware store that I hadn't been to in a long time. One of the cashiers (whom I didn't know from Eve) let out a loud ""Welcome back!"" and added, ""I love how every time you come in our store, you're smiling ... it makes my day."" I guess I was smiling without even realizing it and had no idea how simple smiles can affect other people for the better. -Richard Crank, Topeka, Kan.It's little things that cause that inward smile, like the cloud that swirls up from cream being poured into a hot cup of coffee. It's nice to have simple pleasures. I am thankful. I try to be observant of God's workings in my life and to be aware of His many blessing. Oh, I can get as negative and as angry as the next person, but I try not to stay there long. -Kathy Swanson, Clifton, Texas Think big thoughtsI majored in history, which can be a rather depressing subject. There has been so much oppression in so many ways since more or less the dawn of agriculture. On the other hand, we see dramatic change over time and across cultures regarding everything from the role of women to which professions hold prestige to how life should be lived to how people dress. The fact that things were different once means that society need not work as it does now, which I think is quite the empowering thought. -Christopher West, Cincinnati, OhioThis may sound cynical but I am being earnest: What gives me peace of mind when gloom is looming is to remember that in 5 billion years, the sun will become a red giant and Earth will cease to exist. With that perspective, it puts me more at peace that, for example, salmon may go extinct in my lifetime. It seems less critical to save them (and every other species) knowing that all species will one day share the same fate. (For the record, I hope salmon make it.) -Andrew Murphy, Crescent City, Calif.I try to keep in mind how little control or influence I have to change the state of the country (and world) and let go of the feeling of responsibility. I do what I can and understand that change is slow. One of the greatest gifts of getting old is knowing how little power you have in the grand scheme of things. It relieves you of the feeling that you have to DO something and the frustration and anger that goes with it. -Mary Theresa McCarty, Halfmoon, N.Y.Acknowledging sadness can lead to optimismTo remain optimistic I have to deliberately and regularly make room for my grief. If I acknowledge this weight I carry it can be a tool. It will still cripple me occasionally because burying a trans child is just that hard, but I can also fight for change if I bring my grief with me. - Carrie Black, Salt Lake City, Utah I am Buddhist and there is a meditation that helps me: You elect to feel hopelessness or lovelessness as a way of empathizing with others who feel these things. So when I feel hopeless or sad or overwhelmed, I can think, ""I am going to fully let myself feel this because this is what hopelessness feels like, what millions of others have felt, going back millennia."" Ironically, framing it this way actually feels more connected, more human, more manageable. -Kristin Harriman, Sacramento, Calif.I employ what I refer to as ""delusional optimism,"" which involves telling myself things like, ""It's going to be just fine!"" or ""You've been through much worse!"" or ""Tomorrow won't feel this bad."" The words I tell myself don't change the behavior of others. Difficult situations often remain difficult, but it does make it easier to weather the suffering. When the world won't change for us, sometimes changing how we think about the world is the best we can do. -Lisa Féinics, Bend, Ore.Steer your car wiselyOne of my favorite books is Garth Stein's The Art of Racing in the Rain. I remind myself, as the book states, ""The car goes where your eyes go."" It's so important, especially as the news cycle is full of cruelty and suffering, for us to carefully choose what we read, listen to, pay attention to. The car, my brain, goes where my eyes go — so I need to keep looking at hopeful art and look for joy in the children I love and remind myself to keep watching for good things. I see more of them this way! -Naomi Krokowski, Berthoud, Colo.Do unto othersDoing something for someone else is my all time high — it always lifts me. -Dianne Oelberger, St George, MaineEach morning I start my day by saying, ""God, how may I serve?"" I am a registered nurse working at the VA Medical Center in Washington, D.C. I believe that people are here to be of service to each other — to help, guide, comfort and support those we encounter along the way. Whatever the act of service I provide, the return is so much more. -Christine Grant, Washington, D.C. Be grateful for goodness ... and teaI ask myself two simple questions: First, what are you enjoying right now? For example, at the moment, I am enjoying a cup of strong black tea while I peruse npr.org. Second, what are you looking forward to? Some of the things I'm looking forward to are finishing today's chores, walking by the ocean this weekend, tutoring my adult learners next week and seeing my children and grandchildren in the next month or so. I'm also looking forward to my next cup of tea! -Susan Levine, Monrovia, Calif.It is easy to get swept up in the doom and gloom which permeates the media and online environment. Having lived in Ukraine, [I feel that] the war there is another source of potential despair. Escaping from a victim mentality starts with gratitude: Every night before I go to sleep, I name at least three big or little things I am thankful for on that day. -Douglass Teschner, West Lebanon, N.H. I read a single poem every morning. There is hope in the verse or between the lines, something else to drift on, beyond the headlines. -Mark Karason, Pittsburgh, Pa. Music soothes and energizesMusic in particular kickstarts me and really helps me articulate my feelings in both subconscious and conscious ways. I like to have active listening sessions throughout the day. But what helps me the most is listening to music in bed in the early morning before doing anything else. It puts my mind in a place of zen and allows me to be the best version of myself that day to radiate positive energy not only within, but to the surrounding world as well. -Sean Nguyen, Seattle, Wash.My favorite technique for getting happy is definitely playing loud techno music (or other very rhythmic dance songs), and freestyle dancing in my living room. -Robin McMillan, North Port, Fla. Mother Nature and her creatures are there for youI snuggle with my precious rescue cat Tobago and give her belly rubs and listen to her purr contentedly. I feel stress melting away and joy and optimism filling my heart. Months after the loss of Joey, my cat companion of 16 years, a friend took me to Waterville Humane Society. I was overwhelmed until a sweet black and white cat grabbed me and wouldn't let go. She helped me heal and helped my husband and me survive the pandemic. There's just one thing I don't know: who rescued who. -Jules Hathaway, Veazie, Maine When I'm feeling stressed, I take a walk outside in the sun or in a green space like a park or a forest. Despite the noise in my head, the sounds of nature, including those of birds, wind and rain, comfort me. -Whayoung Cha, Seoul, South KoreaEarly spring walk under blooming cherry trees with daughter Analesa, beloved pup Rosko and warmth of the sun on my face. -Cassandra Zimmerman, Portland, Ore.Laughing and playing ukulele with friends. Planting native plants and taking photos of all the pollinators that come to them. -Rosemary Woodel, Athens, Ga. The way I stay optimistic is waking up early to watch the sunrise and meditate on where I find light in the darkness. There are great things of beauty and peace in this world. -Michelle Middleton, Reno, Nev.For 30 years, I have volunteered with a nonprofit whose mission is to teach gardening to home gardeners throughout our community. I feel constantly renewed by the generosity and energy of the people I volunteer with. While I often feel overwhelmed by the magnitude and variety of troubles in our world, I am also mindful of the abundant blessings that fill my life. I cannot stop war or famine on a global scale, but I can teach a family how to grow food — and flowers. -Robbie Cranch, Fresno, Calif.I find my source of joy in nature. I salute the sun every morning and affirm the blessings of the five elements: the earth, space, sun, air and water. When I recognize that my body was born from these five elements, I feel a deep kinship with nature, our womb. I talk to the trees, recognizing their generosity and strength. -Pankaja Cauligi, Mysore, IndiaA glance at sunlight through a leaf, or dew on the grass will send me a charge of energy that lifts my spirit. I am in my 50s now, and have learned how to rebalance, to hit the reset button when patterns became unsustainable. I garden, and learned that life is very much like gardening. That pain, like dirt, is invaluable to growth. That insect pests and garden weeds, like illnesses and bad choices, are things to look out for, to understand and to manage. We can't keep them out completely and simple routines work well enough. -June Pham, Sacramento, Calif.

Because the grass was greener on the other side.","BOISE, Idaho — Why did 2,500 sheep cross the road? Because the grass was greener on the other side.In Idaho, it's not unusual to see ranchers moving a bleating herd of sheep up to higher elevation at this time of year. But the sight of 2,500 wooly beasts trotting across a highway earlier this week brought a crowd about 300 people.It was the largest turnout that Steve Stuebner, spokesperson for the Idaho Rangeland Resources Commission, has seen in 15 years.""It's a novelty. Maybe they've never seen anything like that before, but it's real typical in Idaho,"" he told KTVB-TV. ""When you're out in rural parts of Idaho in the spring and summer, or fall, you could run into a cattle drive or a sheep drive.""Curious onlookers lined the road as the animals sheepishly entered the highway, guided by ranchers and steered by sheepdogs. They traveled up the road a little ways, the fluffy white herd obscuring the yellow-painted centerline amid a chorus of ""baas"" and the lead ewe's jangling bell.Leaving the open road behind, they will journey through the sagebrush-dotted foothills for a few weeks to their summer home in the Boise National Forest.This trip up to higher elevations is a tradition dating back around 100 years, the Boise-area TV station reported, and having the sheep graze in the forest helps prevent fires and invigorates plant growth.The ovine spectacle will return when the sheep are brought back down again in the fall.

4,"From slams to sidewalks, poetry is alive in Greater Boston",https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/04/28/from-slams-to-sidewalks-poetry-is-alive-in-greater-boston,"Readings, open mics and contests abound in the Boston area as popularity for poetry continues to grow.","While April may be the cruelest month, it’s an exciting time for poetry. From Jamaica Plain to Cambridge, the Boston area is flush with open mics and poetry slams — and over the last few years, it seems like poetry has been winning the hearts and minds of young and old alike.A study found the amount of young people reading poetry almost doubled from 2012-2017, traffic to sites such as Poets.org surged 25% during the beginning of the pandemic, and hundreds of new independent bookstores have opened across the country in recent years. Poets like Rupi Kaur have over four and a half million followers on Instagram, and there have been moments where poetry has exploded in pop culture, including when Amanda Gorman read her poem, “The Hill We Climb” at President Biden’s inauguration. ""The music of poetry is back. And the performance aspects of poetry are back. And the public aspects of poetry are back,"" says Elisa New, professor of American Literature at Harvard University. ""I think those three things, together, really encapsulate why there's this renewed enthusiasm and excitement about poetry. It's been lifted off the page and out of solitary experience and brought back into the body and back into public.""In Cambridge, poetry has been lifted off the page and stamped directly into the ground. Since 2015, the annual Cambridge Sidewalk Poetry Contest has been soliciting poems from residents and choosing five winners — the victorious poems are stamped into fresh concrete throughout the city. This year 336 poems were submitted, although not all the submissions met the guidelines. That's an increase from the 252 submitted last year. The contest was paused in 2021 due to the pandemic. When asked what she hopes happens when someone stumbles across a poem on the sidewalk, Lillian Hsu, director of Public Art for Cambridge Arts, said: ""That they pause. Maybe wonder. Read it. Share it. Keep in mind that location in front of that school or library, there's a poem there. And come back again because many people are walking the same route every day. I think the sidewalk is not just a surface, but it's a whole space... it's a social space, an economic space, a cultural space, and so I think the impact is across time."" Greater Boston has a long history when it comes to poetry. Almost 400 years ago, one of the most important early American poets, Anne Bradstreet, was writing poems in Cambridge (known as Newtown at the time). In the 1700s, one of the ""best known poets"" in America was Phyllis Wheatley, an enslaved woman who spent much of her life in Boston. ""It's disheartening to be able to read somebody's work from 1630's or 1920s and look back from 2023 and say, 'Wow, we've come a long way, but we still have a long way to go,' especially when I'm talking about my experience as a Black, queer woman in the United States,"" said Amanda Shea, Boston-based poet and artist. ""So, I feel like, gentrification, trauma, discrimination, racism, all of those things still exist today, so it's very important for me to keep telling those stories. But also uplift the progression we have made.""GUESTSAmanda Shea, Boston-based multidisciplinary artist, educator and publicistLillian Hsu, director of Public Art at Cambridge ArtsElisa New, Powell M.

5,Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse says Supreme Court needs an enforceable code of conduct,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/04/28/sen-sheldon-whitehouse-says-supreme-court-needs-an-enforceable-code-of-conduct,The Rhode Island senator is leading an ethics investigation against Justice Clarence Thomas.,"Earlier this week, the Supreme Court released a statement stating they will continue to oversee their own actions for ethical violations, and maintain control over whether they should recuse themselves from cases with financial interests. The statement was signed by all nine justices. If the justices were treated like any other person involved in a lawsuit, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) said “they’d get blown out of court, they’d be laughed at.” “It’s really stunning the people who are at the very height of the legal profession would put forward such a preposterous document,” the senator said Friday on Boston Public Radio. The statement was attached to a letter Chief Justice John Roberts wrote to refuse to testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The hearing is in response to criticism of Justice Clarence Thomas’ receiving undisclosed luxury vacations and trips paid for by billionaire Harlan Crow, first reported in an investigation by ProPublica. According to the ProPublica investigation, at least one of Justice Thomas' vacations cost over $500,000. Whitehouse said when justices take large gifts from people with business and political interests that the Supreme Court affects, those gifts can undermine the judicial process and erode trust.“It is highly corrosive of trust in that impartiality,” said Whitehouse. Other Supreme Court justices have also faced scrutiny over gifts and trips. But unlike Justice Thomas’ gifts, most of these were disclosed.Whitehouse is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which introduced a measure to require Supreme Court justices to be held to the same code of conduct as members of Congress and other federal judges. At a minimum, Whitehouse said, this means disclosing large gifts. A committee hearing will take place on May 2, without Chief Justice Roberts present.“I think Congress has solid authority to require basic ethics requirements in the executive branch of government, over ourselves and in the judicial branch of government,” Whitehouse said. He emphasized this would be regulation of justices' administrative conduct, not their judicial decisions. This would require the Supreme Court to have an enforceable, formal code of conduct, which it does not currently have. It’s unclear how much legislation Congress will be able to enforce, but Whitehouse is hoping for bipartisan support. He said Republican Sen. Lindsay Graham has expressed support for the Supreme Court reporting rule.“That shouldn’t be asking much. Everybody already does it,” Whitehouse said.",National,"Fri, 28 Apr 2023 15:55:29 EST",e86a3322a98c3d5b04bd8d9a5ccc5ce3,NARENDRA MODI,"[('the University of Nevada, Reno', 0.2807981073856354), ('@literalpumpkin', 0.2513434886932373), ('Flappy-Bird', 0.24326393008232117), ('Jonathan Stauder', 0.23627562820911407), ('Telltale', 0.2281109243631363), ('Josh Grimm', 0.22810667753219604), (""El Cucuy's"", 0.22397445142269135), ('Zeamo', 0.22351476550102234), ('Steven McDaniels', 0.2229146808385849), ('Olympia', 0.22216756641864777)]",ENTERTAINMENT,"[('British Virgin Islands', 0.255249947309494), ('Andrew Ahn', 0.2548862099647522), ('Lisa Bunker', 0.23899000883102417), ('Robert Crater', 0.22841449081897736), ('Rees', 0.22824127972126007), ('Io', 0.22531944513320923), ('The USS Enterprise', 0.2229827493429184), ('Europa', 0.2179243564605713), ('Jim Davis', 0.21636323630809784), ('Captin Kirk', 0.21481451392173767)]",SOCCER,"[('Japonesque', 0.2931727170944214), ('Wiltshire', 0.27431607246398926), ('EcoTools', 0.2740771770477295), ('Beautyblender', 0.2721855640411377), ('Brian Deegan', 0.2642884850502014), (""L'Oréal"", 0.2604683041572571), ('KeanuReeves', 0.259454607963562), ('Matt Craftons', 0.25829026103019714), ('K&N Pro Series', 0.25715890526771545), ('MONTREUX', 0.2528170347213745)]",ANIMALS,"[('Rojiblancos', 0.27723318338394165), ('Billy Wright', 0.26959818601608276), ('Marco Silva', 0.26298508048057556), ('Third Division', 0.26161304116249084), ('Kevin Mirallas', 0.2566135823726654), ('Ramsey', 0.2555709183216095), ('Vlasic', 0.2514997124671936), ('Busquets', 0.2495180368423462), ('Second Division', 0.24938011169433594), ('the International Select Committee', 0.24778443574905396)]"
6,Trust in the US Supreme Court is dropping. Would adding more justices help?,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/04/28/trust-in-the-us-supreme-court-is-dropping-would-adding-more-justices-help,A national campaign for expansion kicked off in Boston this week with some big names from Massachusetts politics.,"Public views of the U.S. Supreme Court are currently as negative as they’ve been in more than three decades, and Democratic voters in particular are losing faith in the institution. A series of controversial recent decisions, including the reversal of Roe v. Wade, seem to be driving this crisis of confidence, along with troubling revelations about ethical entanglements involving Justice Clarence Thomas.This week, Just Majority, a coalition of left-leaning groups deeply dissatisfied with the court, came to Boston to launch a national campaign aimed at expanding the court, and enlisted U.S. Senators Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley to help make its case. But would expanding the court make its rulings more congruent with public opinion? Should that even be the goal? And if not, what other steps might improve the court’s performance and shore up ebbing public trust? Adam Reilly is joined by Renée Landers, a professor of law at Suffolk University and a past president of the Boston Bar Association, and Paul Collins, a political scientist and Supreme Court expert at UMass Amherst, to discuss the state of the court today and reforms that could boost public confidence moving forward.

7,Could Beacon Hill bring Massachusetts a four-day work week?,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/04/28/could-beacon-hill-bring-massachusetts-a-four-day-work-week,A growing body of research shows some big benefits.,"What if you could work four days a week instead of five — and maybe make the same amount of money while you’re at it? The idea may not be as implausible as it sounds. Evidence is mounting that the four-day week improves employees’ lives while also offering real advantages for companies that adopt it.Now, amid the broader reimagining of work-life balance prompted by the pandemic, some Massachusetts lawmakers are pushing for state government to take an active role in making the four-day work week a reality. Adam Reilly is joined by state Rep. Erika Uyterhoeven, who has filed a bill that would require employers to pay overtime after workers tally 32 hours, and Juliet Schor, a Boston College professor who’s been studying and advocating for a four-day work week for years. They discuss the case for dropping that fifth day, the cultural trends that could bolster the case for change, and the political prospects of the aforementioned legislation.Could you do your job in four days instead of five?

8,Why one man says 'speaking' for the trees can address inequity in Boston,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/04/28/why-one-man-says-speaking-for-the-trees-can-address-inequity-in-boston,"Differing tree coverage across the city tells ""a history of systemic racism.""","On Arbor Day, we are encouraged to plant and celebrate trees, one of our most important resources. When you think about trees, a few things probably come to mind: the bristling of their leaves in the wind, the crunching of their branches when they're on the ground, the feeling you get when you're surrounded by them — which can be rare in a city like Boston. But what does it mean to ""speak"" for trees? ""I'm a big fan of Dr. Seuss and 'The Lorax.' And in the book 'The Lorax,' the Lorax sort of says at a certain point, 'Stop cutting down my trees. I speak for the trees, for they have no tongues.' He doesn't say because they have no voice. The trees actually do have a voice. They just say things in ways that we don't necessarily hear,"" said David Meshoulam, executive director and co-founder of the advocacy group Speak for the Trees. ""And it's time that we come together, building community around, speaking together in one voice for the trees.""Meshoulam joined several volunteers at Kevin Fitzgerald Park in Mission Hill for a recent clean up ahead of Arbor Day. Last year, the group planted about 20 trees. This year, they came back to mulch, water and check in on those same trees, as well as replace the trees that didn't survive with four new ones.One volunteer, Rachel, reflected on the healing power of nature as she pulled weeds.""In the city there are so many cars and never nature,"" she said. ""Being locked up with COVID, you know, no one really got to come out and enjoy. And now we're back out. So this is relaxing.""Mission Hill is home to Northeastern's student population, as well as longstanding Black and Latino communities in the neighborhood. It also has fewer trees than some other neighborhoods.""Drive from West Roxbury out to Mission Hill and you'll see the difference,"" Meshoulam explained. ""And that is not accidental, right? That is a history of systemic racism. It's a history of redlining, disinvestment.""The city is working to address that historic disinvestment. In September, Boston announced a new forestry division and released its Urban Forest Plan. That analysis states that 27% of Boston is covered by trees, but that varies from neighborhood to neighborhood. Just 7% of East Boston is covered by trees, while 44% is covered in Jamaica Plain. Mission Hill, where this recent cleanup was held, falls about in the middle with 25% tree coverage.The city council and Meshoulam recognize the importance of centering equity with new efforts, because trees are not just about visual appeal, they also provide health benefits and protection from the changing climate.""Everyone understands they provide shade, right? On a hot day you want to stand under a tree,"" Meshoulam said. ""But they also absorb air pollutants, right? So they reduce risks of asthma. They mitigate against stormwater flooding, they improve mental health, they reduce violence. They do all these amazing things.""Those issues were illuminated in 2020 when Boston proposed to cut down more than 100 trees lining nearby Melnea Cass Boulevard in Roxbury to widen the roadway. The city scrapped that plan months later, after the organization Friends of Melnea Cass Boulevard pushed back, with the support of Speak for the Trees. At the same time, tree preservation contends with the city's ever-growing need for development in the form of new housing. ""This is becoming one of the least affordable cities to live in. How do we deal with that crisis? We have people living on the street or who can't afford to stay in the city, right?"" Meshoulam said. ""And that might involve removing some trees and replanting. But it can't be, I don't know, Paul Bunyan coming through and just cutting down every tree.""Meshoulam also said volunteering provides an opportunity for residents to learn more about their environment and connect with nature. He believes everyone has a story or a memory about a tree. ""I'm Jewish and my parents are from Israel. And there was an effort to plant trees in Israel to connect Jews from abroad back to the home country, as they call them. And when a baby was born, they would often — a grandmother or something would buy a tree for her, for the grandchild,"" he explained. ""So there's a tree for me planted somewhere, somewhere in Israel.""He's never seen it, and doesn't even know if it survived. But he has the memory.Walking around Fitzgerald Park, he hopes future generations will have their own stories about the pines, plums, redbuds, maples and dogwoods there. Speak for the Trees is hosting a number of events to celebrate Arbor Day.

9,Fired Tucker Carlson Producer: Misogyny and bullying 'trickles down from the top',https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/04/28/fired-tucker-carlson-producer-misogyny-and-bullying-trickles-down-from-the-top,Allegations painting Fox News as an abusive workplace that excuses misogyny and anti-Semitism have been put on blast in the aftermath of star host Tucker Carlson's abrupt firing earlier this week.,"Allegations painting Fox News as an abusive workplace that excuses misogyny and anti-Semitism have been put on blast in the aftermath of star host Tucker Carlson's abrupt firing earlier this week.Misogyny was ""blatant"" on Carlson's show and across Fox News, Abby Grossberg, a former senior booker for Tucker Carlson Tonight told NPR's Leila Fadel on Morning Edition.""They don't care about telling the truth and they don't care about women,"" Grossberg said of Fox News. ""All they care about are ratings and revenue.""Fox has not explained the reasoning behind Carlson's dismissal, which came a week after it settled a high-profile lawsuit with the election-tech company Dominion Voting Systems. The network also fired Carlson's executive producer, Justin Wells.Both Carlson and Wells are named as individual defendants in an ongoing lawsuit against the network by Grossberg, who is suing the network for gender and religious discrimination, as well as unequal pay and failing to accommodate disabilities in federal court in New York.In her original suit, Grossberg describes an environment at Fox News that ""subjugates women based on vile sexist stereotypes, typecasts religious minorities and belittles their traditions, and demonstrates little to no regard for those suffering from mental illness.""Grossberg said her complaints about abuse were dismissed.""I ultimately went and complained to one of my supervisors about the abuse and the bullying and the gaslighting and misogyny that I was putting up with at Tucker,"" Grossberg said. ""And his response to me was, 'We're just following Tucker's tone. That's Tucker's tone.' And I do really believe that it all trickles down from the top.""When asked if she blames Carlson for the toxic environment, Grossberg said that she does. ""It's his show,"" she said.""Fox News engaged an independent outside counsel to immediately investigate the concerns raised by Ms. Grossberg, which were made following a critical performance review,"" according to a statement from a Fox News spokesperson.Grossberg filed her original suit in March; the network fired her days after.Grossberg, who is Jewish, also alleges in her lawsuit that her and other Jewish colleagues were ridiculed for observing traditional holidays and that the network tokenized employees and gave them diversity awards.At Carlson's show, male colleagues regularly made comments that were demeaning to women, according to Grossberg. ""There were conversations that women who had tattoos or piercings or colored hair were disgusting,"" Grossberg told NPR's Leila Fadel.Before joining the team, Grossberg said she thought Carlson's racist and misogynistic remarks were all for show.""I was hopeful that maybe there was a kinder person behind the on-air persona,"" Grossberg told Fadel, ""but unfortunately, it's quite the reverse.""""What's being said in the office by his team and also his lieutenants who are carrying out his orders is very consistent with what ends up on the air and what the public sees,"" said Grossberg.In a brief statement issued Monday morning, the network announced it had ""agreed to part ways"" with Carlson, who had been widely considered to be the face of the Fox News brand.Speaking publicly for the first time since his firing, Carlson posted a vague two-minute video to Twitter on Wednesday night.""True things prevail,"" he said in the video. ""Where can you still find Americans saying true things? There aren't many places left, but there are some, and that's enough. As long as you can hear the words, there is hope. See you soon.""In response to a question about Grossberg's allegations, Carlson told NPR, ""I know nothing about her. I never met her."" Indeed, Grossberg told NPR's Leila Fadel that Carlson mostly worked from Maine or Florida, ""where he doesn't have to take accountability for what he says on air or what goes on in the office. And I think that's very deliberate. And he has three men that carry out his orders and make sure that we do follow.""Grossberg said she was ""in disbelief"" when she heard that Carlson had been fired.""Obviously I'm at the center of this with two suits that he's named in. And I also endured a very abusive atmosphere in his office. So feelings were mixed. It went from being very excited to, you know, that there was some justice to also not wanting anybody to be hurt that was there that had lost their jobs,"" she said.Grossberg says Fox attorneys pressured her to lie in Dominion caseIn a separate suit filed in Delaware, Grossberg is suing the network and individual attorneys for allegedly setting her up to take the blame, along with Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo, for broadcasting the falsehoods about election fraud in 2020 that were at the heart of Dominion's defamation case against Fox. Grossberg alleges that Fox attorneys pressured her to lie under oath in order to downplay the misogyny she says is rampant at Fox News.""Her allegations in connection with the Dominion case are baseless and we will continue to vigorously defend Fox against her unmeritorious legal claims which are riddled with false allegations against the network and our employees,"" according to the statement from a Fox News spokesperson.Though Fox settled the suit with Dominion earlier this month, paying it $787.5 million to avert a trial, there's more still to come.Another voting tech company, Smartmatic, which is headquartered in London, has also sued Fox News for defamation over election fraud lies. It is seeking $2.7 billion in damages.Lawyers for Smartmatic have requested to subpoena Grossberg in that case.

10,One way to prevent suicides: limit access to guns,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/04/28/one-way-to-prevent-suicides-limit-access-to-guns,"More than half of gun-related deaths in the U.S. are suicides. But James Russell, a biology professor at Georgia Gwinnett College, says that most people do not want to accept how common it is. ""People that haven't been through this just want to bury their head in the sand,"" Russell says. ""They don't want to hear it.""","More than half of gun-related deaths in the U.S. are suicides. But James Russell, a biology professor at Georgia Gwinnett College, says that most people do not want to accept how common it is. ""People that haven't been through this just want to bury their head in the sand,"" Russell says. ""They don't want to hear it.""Russell's father took his own life when Russell was 15. He died two days after he turned a gun on himself, which gave Russell time to see and talk to his dad one last time. Russell recalls seeing him in the hospital bed, holding his hand, and his father speaking to James one last time. ""He said you don't understand. And then after a pause, he said it was an accident.""Research says that's true: Most people who attempt suicide only contemplate the decision for an hour.Now, Russell facilitates support groups at the nonprofit Everytown Survivor Network, helping people who have lost loved ones to gun violence. He says these groups, more than anything, have helped him process his father's death and the way he died.Does access to guns increase suicides? Mass shootings may garner the most attention, but suicides account for most gun deaths in America. Catherine Barber, a researcher at Harvard Injury Control Research Center, says once people recognize suicide as the most common form of gun violence, they're better positioned to protect against the risk: they can check for warning signs and remove the means for impulsive actions.""You just need to buy the time to find the proper treatment for that feeling of suicidality — nobody is meant to suffer in the way that you might be suffering, and people do recover,"" Barber tells NPR's Michel Martin.In 2009, Barber began working on the Gun Shop Project, which asks gun shop owners, firearms instructors and gun rights advocates to act as ""lifesavers."" The initiative encourages gun stores and firearms dealers to display and distribute materials with suicide prevention tips that include storing ammunition in another person's home or asking a friend to change the combination on their gun locker. ""You want to take kind of a 'friends don't let friends drive drunk approach' to guns and suicide,"" Barber says.Barber tells Morning Edition that she and her team focus on firearms because of their lethal potential. 82% of suicide attempts are successful because of guns. ""Precisely what people value about guns is what makes them so dangerous in a suicide attempt,"" Barber says.Studies of those who attempt suicide and survive indicate the decision to take one's own life doesn't always involve lengthy planning. One study of participants who survived an attempt found that half of them considered it for less then 10 minutes. Barber stresses that such attempts are often preceded by long battles with depression or another mental health concern. She wants to remove the ability of people who have been struggling long-term to act on a short-term feeling.Resistance to gun safety training and permits Barber says she finds that gun enthusiasts will listen, but may not always embrace changes in the law or training protocols.Mark Pennack is the president of Maryland Carry, a gun rights group that is lobbying the state legislature to reject proposed requirements for firearms dealers to distribute information about firearms as a suicide risk factor. ""Guns don't cause somebody to want to kill themselves,"" Pennack argues.Even though she is a gun safety advocate, Barber understands the concerns about legislating change. ""People who value gun rights feel under attack and when forced to do something often will assume that this is simply one more attack and an over-step by a nanny state.""But Russell rejects the argument that guns aren't a major contributor to suicide. ""There's very little turning back when you use a gun."" He believes that working toward safer gun policies will help avert similar tragedies. ""Guns make temporary problems terminal.""If you or someone you know may be considering suicide or is in crisis, call or text 9 8 8 to reach the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.

11,"Despite mass layoffs, there are still lots of jobs out there. Here's where",https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/04/28/despite-mass-layoffs-there-are-still-lots-of-jobs-out-there-heres-where,Mass layoffs have dominated the headlines as huge companies shed hundreds of thousands of workers.,"Mass layoffs have dominated the headlines as huge companies shed hundreds of thousands of workers. But the economy is still adding jobs – 236,000 last month alone. And many industries are struggling to snap workers up. NPR's Juana Summers spoke with Dana Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board — a nonprofit think tank — to find out what jobs are still hot.This interview has been edited for length and clarity.Interview highlightsOn where the jobs are (and aren't) in the economy Understand that there are three buckets [to the labor market].You have that first bucket, and those are the pandemic darlings like technology, transportation, warehousing, construction because interest rates were super low and everybody ran out and bought a house. Also real estate tied to that, and retail. Those sectors that did very well during the pandemic now are not doing so well because there's been a shift in demand from goods to services – so those are the sectors that are letting people go.Then you have your sectors in the middle that are holding on to their labor forces, and we call that hoarding. The reason why is because many CEOs think that if there is a recession, it's going to be short and it's not going to be that bad. And so why would you let everybody go and then have to turn around, you know, nine months later and hire everybody back? So they're just holding on to their workers.Then there's a third bucket of industries that are actively hiring, and those are the industries that are keeping the employment data that we're seeing so buoyant. And that is mainly those industries that you have to show up for work. You physically have to go to the job.On examples of industries searching for workersThose industries include health care and also accommodation and food services, hotels and restaurants, airlines – many of those industries, you have to go to work and there's just not enough people. So those businesses are still trying to hire people and recover all the jobs that were lost during the pandemic. Also, there are pretty big labor shortages and federal, state and local governments. Why? Because lots of people are retiring and the government can't necessarily raise wages as rapidly to meet the demand for wages. So they have these massive labor shortages. On health care, an industry that has seen layoffs but also nursing shortagesWhen we look at the employment data that comes out the first Friday of every month, health care has been hiring people pretty strongly. So you may hear about layoffs here and there, but on net, there's still more hiring than people hitting let go. And absolutely you are having shortages of nurses because that is a job where you have to show up for work. It's very difficult. You don't have as many people wanting to go into that sector, right? So the nurses who do want to go into that sector, they're demanding very high wages. And we're seeing those elevated wages being passed on to consumers and causing inflation. And the thing is that the sector that is going to have the most labor shortages over the next decade is health care.On advice for current job seekersThere are certain industries that are still hiring. So if you don't mind switching industries or getting yourself trained to go into a different industry, do it. Maybe the tech sector isn't where you want to go right now, but certainly you could still do technology within the hospital sector. They have computers and they have technology in all sorts of things. So they might be willing to hire you even though your big tech firm may not be willing to do that. It's possible to switch industries if you can still stay within your occupation, so I would suggest that people look at the industries that are still hiring, that still need workers and go there.

12,Kids under 13 would be barred from social media under bipartisan Senate bill,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/04/28/kids-under-13-would-be-barred-from-social-media-under-bipartisan-senate-bill,A bipartisan group of senators announced a new piece of legislation this week geared towards protecting children from aspects of social media they say are contributing to the mental health crisis impacting America's youth.,"A bipartisan group of senators announced a new piece of legislation this week geared towards protecting children from aspects of social media they say are contributing to the mental health crisis impacting America's youth.The Protecting Kids on Social Media Act would set the minimum age of social media users to 13. For teens between the ages of 13 and 18, parental consent would be required, and platforms would be banned from using algorithms to recommend content to those young users. Adults would have to create an account for their teens, providing a valid form of ID to become users on a platform, according to the bill.Children under 13, however, will still be allowed to view content on social media sites, the bill says, as long as it doesn't require an individual to log in to do so.There are four lawmakers sponsoring the bill, Republican Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Alabama's Katie Britt alongside Democratic Sens. Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Connecticut's Chris Murphy, who say America's mental health crisis weighs most heavily on adolescents, especially young girls.""The business model of these apps is simple, the duration of time the user spends on the app and the extent to which they engage with content is directly correlated with ad revenue,"" Schatz said, arguing that companies want users to spend long amounts of time on their platforms but the results can be ""catastrophic."" ""Social media [companies] have stumbled onto a stubborn, devastating fact: The way to get kids to linger on the platforms and to maximize platforms is to upset them,"" Schatz told reporters at a press conference announcing the bill on Capitol Hill Wednesday.Cotton, meanwhile said many social media companies claim to not allow kids under 13 on their platforms, and instead rely on self-reporting methods, which can be easily bypassed by children.During the announcement, Britt said it's important to take a step back so parents can teach kids how to use social media for good while staying safe. Social media, she noted, can be difficult enough to digest for individuals well over 18.""As adults, how many of you have struggled with what someone has posted on social media, or what someone has said or what someone has done?,"" she asked.A majority of teens say they use social media platforms like TikTok and YouTube at least once a day, and others admit to using the sites almost ""constantly,"" according to a recent Pew Research study. Over half of the teens polled said it would be hard for them to stop using social media.The new legislation will put ""parents back in control"" of what kids experience online, Cotton said. He said if an adolescent is too young for other real world experiences and responsibilities, from signing contracts, opening a banking account and watching rated R movies, then they are too young to witness some content on these platforms.Schatz said, ""The growing evidence is clear: social media is making kids more depressed and wreaking havoc on their mental health,"" adding, ""while kids are suffering, social media companies are profiting. This needs to stop.""The senators cited disturbing results from a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study, which found 42% high school students surveyed experienced persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness over the last year.Twenty-two percent seriously contemplated attempting suicide, with one in four young women going as far as to formulate a plan on how they would carry it out.Murphy, a father of two, said the warning signs of social media's impact on kids are abundantly clear and that now is the time to take action.""This is a reality that we don't have to accept. The alarm bells about social media's devastating impact on kids have been sounding for a long time, and yet time and time again, these companies have proven they care more about profit than preventing the well-documented harm they cause,"" he said. ""None of this is out of Congress's control.""A statement issued by several advocacy groups that focus on the safe use of social media raised concerns about the legislation. They include Common Sense Media, Fairplay for Kids and the Center for Digital Democracy, which said though the bill is ""well-intentioned,"" some aspects take the wrong approach.The advocacy groups said they support the banning of algorithmic recommendations targeting minors; however, they believe the bill is burdensome to parents, creates unrealistic bans and could be harmful to kids in unhealthy living situations.""By requiring parental consent before a teen can use a social media platform, vulnerable minors, including LGBTQ+ kids and kids who live in unsupportive households, may be cut off from access to needed resources and community,"" the group statement reads.The group also said the minimum age requirement tied to parental consent jeopardizes an adolescent user's privacy. James P. Steyer, founder and CEO of Common Sense Media, said in the statement that the group appreciates the senators' efforts and they look forward to working with them in the future, ""but this is a life or death issue for families and we have to be very careful about how to protect kids online.""Steyer recommended social media companies shoulder the responsibility for making the internet a safe space for kids to avoid making the government the middle man between parents and their children.

13,Airbnb let its workers live and work anywhere. Spoiler: they're loving it,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/04/28/airbnb-let-its-workers-live-and-work-anywhere-spoiler-theyre-loving-it,"When Carrie Kissell learned that her employer Airbnb was letting people live and work anywhere, she was on a sailboat off the coast of Key Biscayne, enjoying some time off with her partner.","When Carrie Kissell learned that her employer Airbnb was letting people live and work anywhere, she was on a sailboat off the coast of Key Biscayne, enjoying some time off with her partner.The thought came to her: Why not just stay on the boat?""It was this opportunity I couldn't not take,"" says Kissell, an internal events planner formerly based in San Francisco.Her weekday routine for the next three months was typical — eat breakfast, open laptop, attend meetings, get stuff done.""And then when the workday was over, I'd close my laptop and you know, go snorkeling,"" she says.Work from home, work from the office, work from ArgentinaAt a time when more and more workers are finding themselves back in their offices at least a few days a week, Airbnb is going full throttle on flexibility. This week marks one year since the company announced its Live and Work Anywhere policy, and now, it's time to gloat.""The business has actually never performed better since we moved to this program,"" says Airbnb Chief Financial Officer Dave Stephenson. ""It's working really well for us.""Other companies, including tech ones, are taking a very different path.The Pew Research Center found that among people whose jobs can be done remotely, just over a third are still working from home all the time, down from 43% a year ago.At Airbnb, all but a very few employees have a choice: They can work from home (anywhere in the country where they're based), or they can go into an Airbnb office (there are 26 of them around the world).Regardless of where they live, they keep their same salary.And they aren't bound by geography, with the company allowing them to work in over 170 other countries for up to 90 days per year per country. Airbnb is talking to governments abroad about making it easier for all people to work around the world.Talent doesn't want to be tied downThere is an obvious business interest here. People who can jet off somewhere with their laptops are potential Airbnb guests and hosts.Freeing people from the office has also provided savings for the company, whose office footprint is now less than half of what it was before the pandemic.Still, Stephenson insists that Live and Work Anywhere is really about winning the global war for talent.""The best talent in the world is not all within a 50-mile radius of San Francisco,"" he says.And that talent, Stephenson says, no longer wants to be tied down.Before the pandemic, 95% of Airbnb employees lived near a company office. Now, almost a quarter of employees are more than 50 miles from an office, beyond a comfortable commute.A migration out of San FranciscoSteve Stecher has gone even farther than an hour's drive.Stecher moved his family out of a one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco during the pandemic, and since last fall they have spent most of their time in Buenos Aires.That has dramatically changed their financial picture, says Stecher, a senior manager of quality assurance at Airbnb.""Don't repeat this to my boss, but I think it's about 30%, or maybe 40% maximum, of the cost of living in the Bay Area,"" he says.Stecher manages a team of about 140 people, many of whom have also moved out of California, but primarily to the Midwest and East Coast where they have family, he says.""We did used to have a lot of fun in person,"" Stecher says about one of the tradeoffs in his new life.Airbnb now flies teams in for regular in-person gatherings, which the company sees as critical to success.""We are not remote first. We are just being intentional about how we gather,"" says Stephenson. ""It's not a random three days a week where you hope to run into people at a water cooler.""Deploying a team called Ground Control, Airbnb works to ensure that the right people are in the right place at the right time for these large gatherings.""We're still learning the right rhythms for when people are getting together,"" Stephenson says. ""I think that's the biggest challenge that we have.""Catering to different needs, and a healthy bottom lineAirbnb added 900,000 hosts last year, reaching a total of 6.6 million worldwide. Revenue growth has been strong. Stephenson sees these as signs the company is moving in the right direction.Moreover, employees are happy. Airbnb's attrition rate is close to an all-time low and falling, the company says.And Airbnb's goal of hiring more women and under-represented minorities has gotten a boost from the new policy.""Now that we're in a live anywhere context, it really gives us an opportunity to cater to different needs,"" says Benny Etienne, a leader of Black@, the company's affinity group for Black employees.

14,A bus driver in Michigan fainted at the wheel. Then a 7th-grader took control,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/04/28/a-bus-driver-in-michigan-fainted-at-the-wheel-then-a-7th-grader-took-control,A seventh-grader in Michigan is being heralded a hero after he safely stopped his school bus after the driver passed out.,"A seventh-grader in Michigan is being heralded a hero after he safely stopped his school bus after the driver passed out. At 2:59 p.m. local time on Wednesday, a driver for Warren Consolidated Schools called the transportation base to let them know that she was feeling dizzy and needed to pull the bus over. As she slowed the bus down in preparation to stop, she lost consciousness, and the bus was still moving. Then, Dillon Reeves, sitting about five rows back, sprung into action. He threw his backpack down, ran to the front of the bus, grabbed the steering wheel and slowly applied the brakes before the bus could veer into oncoming traffic. Once the bus was stopped, Dillon yelled to his classmates, ""Someone call 911. Now!"" ""In my 35-plus years of education, this was an extraordinary act of courage and maturity on his part,"" Warren Consolidated Schools Superintendent Robert Livernois said at a news conference Thursday. The driver is currently in the hospital undergoing testing and monitoring, and must be screened for drugs, Livernois said. The driver, who was hired last July, had no previous history of fainting and had passed a required medical exam, Livernois said. There was light traffic on the road at the time of the incident and the bus was not damaged, Livernois said. A man walking down the street and a woman two cars behind the bus came to help after the incident. The man checked on the driver, while the woman led the children off the bus through the rear so they would not interfere with responders, Livernois said. Steve Reeves, Dillon's father, said his son has often rode on his lap while he drives and has driven golf carts in the past. Ireta Reeves, Dillon's mom, said, ""Dillon, he's really been a great guy this year. He's come a long way. He's surprised us with great grades and his performances at school, with friends, with peers, and to do something like this just fills my heart. It makes my heart skip a beat to even watch that video."" Steve and Ireta Reeves, who are a health and safety supervisor and community nurse, respectively, said Dillon wants to be a police officer or a professional hockey player. The school board will hold a commendation ceremony for Dillon soon, Livernois said, and at home, Steve Reeves said he will take Dillon for ice cream and a weekend at the family's camper.""I don't know that it could have gone any better, and when you have an anchor like Dylan taking care of business on the bus, it really and truly was a good day for us,"" Livernois said.

I've watched America change a lot. I've watched divisions grow and I've felt a sense of negativity boil over,"" said the host. He implored his audience to ""remember what America signifies to the rest of the world. My entire life it has always been a place of optimism. ... Yes, it has flaws but show me a place that doesn't. Show me a person that doesn't.""Just because somebody disagrees with you it doesn't make them bad or evil. We are all more the same than we are different. There are so many people who are trying to stoke those differences and we have to try as best we can to look for the light, look for the joy. If you do, it's out there. That's all this show has ever been about,"" he said.Corden announced one year ago that he would be ending his late-night show after eight seasons, citing a desire to return to his native UK to be closer to family and loved ones. His parents were seated in the audience for the final taping, and his sisters, he joked, were in town too —- but at a bar instead.Also Thursday, CBS aired a primetime special called The Last Last Late Late Show Special featuring taped segments with Tom Cruise (where they performed stunts and sang a duet of ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" from ""The Lion King"") and Adele, where they taped a final Carpool Karaoke segment.Corden reminded the singer that she has an Emmy, Grammy and Oscar and wondered if she would ever actively pursue a Tony Award. ""You have the EGO"" he said.""I really don't think that that is ever gonna happen. I would never write a musical or anything like that because I (expletive) hate musicals,"" said Adele to laughter. ""I also think the EGO suits me better.""Harry Styles and Will Ferrell were Corden's final guests. Styles has been a frequent visitor to the show, and has even guest-hosted twice. He's been game for a number of taped bits with Corden including the time the host directed a music video for Styles' song Daylight for just $300 and when the musician took part in a more than 11-minute segment featuring a UK Vs. U.S. dodgeball game where Corden, Styles, ""Games of Thrones"" actor James Bradley and Benedict Cumberbatch faced off against players including Michelle Obama, Mila Kunis, Kate Hudson, Lena Waithe, and Melissa McCarthy.""As a friend, I'm so incredibly proud of you,"" Styles told Corden. ""On a personal note, you've been a safe space to me always as a friend."" He added that he was '""selfishly very excited that you're coming home."" Styles, Corden and Ferrell then embraced in a group hug.There were also goodbyes from the other late night hosts. Seth Meyers, Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Fallon, Stephen Colbert and David Letterman all appeared in a pre-taped segment with Corden. They joked that since Corden was ending his show, they could each call dibs on one of his segments.They all chose Carpool Karaoke, referencing Corden's most popular sketch where he drives around Los Angeles with celebrities and sing songs. Paul McCartney, Justin Bieber, Mariah Carey, Stevie Wonder and Chris Martin are a few of his Carpool Karaoke passengers. The segment was such a hit that it spun-off into its own series for Apple. Corden only appeared in the debut episode with Will Smith in the car.Corden closed out the night by playing a piano and singing a song with the crew and staff gathered around the stage. ""Part of me thinks I should stay here forever but deep in my heart I just know,"" Corden sang. ""No more shows to be showing, it's time I was going, It's time. Thanks for watching, that's our show.""

16,Could AI revolutionize how doctors treat mental health?,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/04/27/could-ai-revolutionize-how-doctors-treat-mental-health,"One of the biggest challenges in mental health is data measurement, says Dr. Carl Marci.","Even if the stigma surrounding getting mental health care is beginning to subside, one huge barrier remains for many people: actually finding a doctor with time to treat them. While suicide rates spiked back up in 2021, the United States is expected to be short by 15,000 to 30,000 psychiatrists nationwide by 2024. Some estimates project the nation will be short more than 30,000 psychiatrists. But a medical data company based in Boston called OM1 built an AI-based platformed called PhenOM, which could potentially help streamline the process for patients to get the care they need, when they need it.Dr. Carl Marci, chief psychiatrist and managing director of mental health and neuroscience at OM1, joined GBH’s All Things Considered host Arun Rath to break down the new technology and shine a light on the role artificial intelligence could be playing in the future of mental health care. What follows is a lightly edited transcript.Arun Rath: First off, give us a broad sense of how this new technology works. What does PhenOM do, and how does it do it?Dr. Carl Marci: I think the first step in any really good application of artificial intelligence in health care is great data. We get data from a variety of sources — often from medical and pharmacy claims, we get data from the government — but importantly, we also get data from electronic health records of patients. We’re very, very careful to de-identify the data and make sure it’s handled in a very secure way and organize it in the cloud. Once that’s done and in a common data architecture — which means we can actually apply some of these tools — then the fun begins and we can really begin to leverage that data for patient care.Rath: Is this a diagnostic aid, ultimately?Marci: Well, there’s many applications. One of them is to help identify patients who are at risk for either worsening disease, or what’s often referred to as treatment resistance.In the space of depression, you may be aware that often our medications, as good as they are, don’t work for everyone. So we’re using our data to begin to subtype different types of depression and identify patients who may go on to have treatment resistance, and then they could benefit from some of the new treatments that are in our pipeline that we hope will help patients who have failed other types of interventions.Rath: What are some of the other applications? Marci: One of my favorite applications, and one I’m very proud of, is our ability to amplify endpoints. What does that mean? Well, in the real world, it’s very hard to get patients to fill our surveys, and it’s often hard to get clinicians to ask patients to fill in surveys. One of the challenges in mental health is measurement. We don’t have a culture in this country — in psychiatry, in mental health — of assessing patients with the types of tools that are available. So we’ve developed a technology that can model based on a clinician’s notes in the chart and estimate what’s essentially a disease progression score. People might be familiar with the PHQ-9, [the Patient Health Questionnaire-9]. You’ve probably filled one out of your primary care doctor where they ask you a series of questions screening you for depression. We’re able to do that with our artificial intelligence tool and generate a score to fill in gaps in the patient’s journey, and that allows us to do a better job researching our data sets and identifying who’s going to respond to what type of treatment.Rath: You reminded me of something a psychiatrist said to me a long time ago about the difficulty of the field: they don’t have the diagnostic tools that other doctors do. There aren’t X-rays or the kinds of ways you can see inside the body to treat the kind of disease they do. It sounds like the data could provide that kind of window?Marci: I think that’s exactly the right way to think about it. We call it PHenOM because what it really is doing is phenotyping. A phenotype is the sort of behavioral expression of a disease or an illness. So we use our machine learning and our artificial intelligence tools to take literally billions of data points in identified patients to begin to parse them into different groups. Then, the next step is to begin to look and see who responds to what types of treatment so that, in the near future, we can have clinicians sitting at the bedside, put into the computer a few parameters based on the history the patient gives us, or even read the clinical note and give some intelligent feedback about what that patient is most likely to respond to. We haven’t been able to do that in mental health, and that’s one of the things I’m most excited about. Rath: You know, a lot of people will come into this thinking about AI and thinking of autonomous things — like a psychiatry bot that steps in. But this is more of augmenting what humans are doing. Marci: In this case, we’re really trying to create tools for the bedside in clinics and within existing care models.Now, what you’re referring to, and what I think everyone is excited about, are these large language models, like ChatGPT, and what kind of role they could have in mental health. There are some exciting applications, and for me, the idea of using an artifical bot that has natural language is exciting in a couple of applications. One of them is to fill in the gaps in care. You know, if I’m lucky, when I’m in a clinic, I will see a patient every two weeks — more typically, every six, eight or 12 weeks. So there’s a lot of time in between those encounters with me. If we had a tool that we trusted to interact with patients, assess them, give some basic advice, encourage them to change their behaviors and apply some of the skills we’ve been working on, to take their medication, I think we would see outcomes get a lot better. Rath: So, say that first stage where you’re filling out those forms — and we know that people sometimes don’t fill them out that well — you could have some kind of interface that asked you questions in a better way.Marci: You also could have an interface to remind you to fill it out. One of the biggest challenges we have is just reminding people that they haven’t filled it out, and encouraging them and doing that in an engaging and empathic and natural way.We know that face-to-face interactions create and generate a therapeutic response. So what I’m optimistic about is that computers can get to the place where they can augment and complement human interventions — not replace — and fill in some of the gaps in care and collect data that then a clinician can then use to get better outcomes.Rath: How soon do you expect that people will be seeing this technology at their own doctor’s offices?Marci: Well, if history is any guide, I think there’s going to be a lot of hype over the next one to two years, and then reality will set in. What I encourage everyone to think about and realize is that any of these models are really only as good as the data they’re based on. What I worry today about rushing to use large language models like ChatGPT clinically is that they are based on good information and misinformation. God forbid someone who, for example, is thinking about suicide interacts with a tool like this, and it mistakenly gives them instructions for how to commit suicide. That would be a tragedy.

The ruling casts doubt on approximately 27,000 OUI convictions from that time period and affirmed that those people can seek a new trial because of the faulty tests. Andrea Cabral, former Massachusetts Secretary of Public Safety and Security, acknowledged the justice it brings for those who could have been wrongfully convicted. But she also worried about the potential fallout with serial drunk drivers, who could get one or more convictions overturned and have lighter penalties on future offenses. “This is a huge decision,” Cabral said on Boston Public Radio Thursday. “The problem was that the State Police Office of Alcohol Testing ... intentionally withheld information about the lack of calibration with the breathalyzer — and this is eight years’ worth of results.” The 27,000 affected cases will not be automatically dismissed, but Cabral said convicted drivers who were subjected to this particular type of breathalyzer test now have the opportunity to request a new trial. That may take a while, she said, since Massachusetts district attorneys will have to carefully look at every motion filed and review the evidence of each case.“And when they get their new trial, assuming the judge grants it, those [breathalyzer] results cannot be used in the new trial,” she said.It’s the latest step in the multiyear saga as the Office of Alcohol Testing’s misconduct came to light. The breadth of its misconduct led to a judge temporarily holding that breath tests could not be used as evidence in court in Massachusetts. Cabral said the State Police should be held more responsible.“I think that should be a criminal investigation. That’s tampering with evidence. That’s withholding, obstructing justice. There’s gotta be some charge that could be the basis of an investigation,” Cabral argued.She says that the withheld information is disappointing and was troubled about the public safety consequences that the ruling has for repeat offenders, who have been convicted multiple times for driving under the influence. “‘When the constable stumbles, the guilty man goes free,’” she quoted. “Someone who has driven drunk and been convicted, at least a couple of times legitimately, now has one conviction removed from their record. So the punishment for a third or fourth offense will not be as severe,” Cabral added. On the other side of the case is justice for those who may have been wrongfully convicted due the faulty machines.“This is absolutely the right decision in this case,” she said.",Local,"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 18:03:30 EST",7f82f8b716ee98578d5b83e392b1cb7f,NARENDRA MODI,"[('Richard Neal', 0.31295180320739746), (""Sotheby's"", 0.27826255559921265), ('BoE', 0.27769869565963745), ('Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries', 0.27629271149635315), ('U.S.-made', 0.27206894755363464), ('Genesis Global Trading', 0.2652818262577057), ('Visa Inc.', 0.2638520896434784), ('Tayyip Erdogan', 0.25990739464759827), ('Kuroda', 0.25962066650390625), ('Sevens Report Research', 0.2596015930175781)]",ENTERTAINMENT,"[('Oak Cliff', 0.33409926295280457), ('Caris LeVert', 0.31393226981163025), ('Old Fashioned', 0.3109748959541321), ('Eden', 0.30985021591186523), ('Sunday Riley', 0.3089447617530823), ('Burks', 0.30495211482048035), ('Lenore Skenazy', 0.29810038208961487), ('Dateline NBC', 0.29687121510505676), ('The House of LR&C', 0.29580721259117126), ('RMS Beauty', 0.2949703335762024)]",SOCCER,"[('SAND', 0.32943159341812134), ('WrestlingNews.co', 0.32845303416252136), ('Alan Gold', 0.32810795307159424), ('XFL', 0.32789090275764465), (""Tony Khan's"", 0.32298654317855835), ('South Seas', 0.3188101053237915), ('Countrywide Financial', 0.31684818863868713), ('the Scientific Revolution', 0.3167870044708252), ('Enron', 0.31637945771217346), ('Intelligent Asset Allocation', 0.31420809030532837)]",ANIMALS,"[('Oscars', 0.22938647866249084), ('Sara Gilbert', 0.21640054881572723), ('Bialik', 0.21351705491542816), ('Sean Murray', 0.20784540474414825), ('Lee6', 0.20673391222953796), (""the Sydney Children's Hospitals Foundation"", 0.20245827734470367), ('Neil Patrick Harris', 0.200308158993721), ('Hello Games', 0.19863925874233246), ('Brielle', 0.19658681750297546), ('Cyrus', 0.19612903892993927)]"
18,"Former Holyoke Soldiers’ Home leaders can be prosecuted for COVID deaths, SJC rules",https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/04/27/former-holyoke-soldiers-home-leaders-can-be-prosecuted-for-covid-deaths-sjc-rules,"AG Campbell’s office said the decision returns the case to Hampden Superior Court, where they face criminal charges in the more than 70 deaths.","A criminal trial can proceed against two former Holyoke Soldiers' Home officials accused of negligence that led to the deaths of elderly veteran residents early in the COVID-19 pandemic, the state's highest court ruled Thursday.In a 5-2 decision that reversed a lower court's dismissal of grand jury indictments, the Supreme Judicial Court said prosecutors should have a chance to try their case against Bennett Walsh, the facility's former superintendent, and David Clinton, its former medical director.The five-justice majority concluded that there is probable cause to believe Walsh and Clinton both qualified as ""caretakers"" for the veterans who lived in the state-run facility, and that their decision-making weeks into the public health emergency — particularly a move to combine symptomatic and asymptomatic veterans in a single, undersized unit — ""wantonly or recklessly"" exposed victims to the highly infectious virus.Superior Court Judge Edward McDonough ""erred in dismissing the indictments"" in November 2021, the high court said.""Of course, sometimes bad things happen for no discernable reason, and no one is to blame. At any subsequent trial, prosecutors will need to prove their case,"" Justice Dalila Argaez Wendlandt wrote in the majority ruling. ""We conclude only that they will have the opportunity to do so.""The case against Walsh and Clinton is based largely on a March 27, 2020 decision they allegedly made to combine 42 residents from two dementia units into a single unit that typically held 25 beds. Some of the veterans were symptomatic for COVID-19, and some were asymptomatic.Justices said that move ""produced a more considerable chance or probability"" of contracting COVID-19, even though Walsh and Clinton had argued the floors they were combining were self-contained and that the residents had already been exposed to the virus.Wendlandt's majority ruling quoted grand jury testimony from a state epidemiologist, who said guidance had been calling for separating patients who had tested positive and those who were asymptomatic as early as March 4, 2020 — more than three weeks before the consolidation.""In fact, Clinton apparently recognized the significance of the exposure risk, exercising particular caution with respect to himself and the doctors at the Soldiers' Home; on the same day that [a veteran] tested positive for COVID-19, Clinton began quarantining at home for a week because he was in a high-risk population — like the veterans in his care — and he advised other doctors to minimize their time at the Soldier's Home as well,"" Wendlandt wrote. ""Yet the grand jury heard testimony indicating that, despite protecting himself and fellow doctors against the risk of exposure, Clinton did not employ the same caution towards the veterans.""Justices David Lowy and Elspeth Cypher dissented. Lowy penned a 14-page dissent, attached to the opinion, arguing that Walsh and Clinton did their best to manage the risks of a nascent public health crisis amid staffing shortages.Lowy wrote that he and Cypher did not believe there was the necessary evidence to determine the defendants acted ""wantonly or recklessly.""""At its core, this prosecution is nothing more than an exercise in assigning blame with the benefit of hindsight,"" Lowy wrote. ""A finding of probable cause that the defendants acted wantonly or recklessly in this case ignores the chaos, uncertainty, and unknowns present during the earliest days of the pandemic. Such a finding also fails to recognize the untenable staffing challenges the Soldiers' Home in Holyoke (Soldiers' Home) faced during this time.""""There can be no doubt that what occurred at the Soldiers' Home in March 2020 was a tragedy,"" Lowy added. ""And in the face of such tragedy, perhaps hurling blame and subjecting the defendants to imprisonment might salve our conscience. But criminalizing blame will do nothing to prevent further tragedy or help unravel the complex reasons why the responses of the Soldiers' Home and so many nursing homes proved inadequate in the nascent days of the pandemic.""The landmark opinion is poised to revive the spotlight on one of the most high-profile individual crises of the public health emergency. At least 76 military veterans who lived in the Holyoke long-term care facility died of COVID-19, prompting a flurry of investigations, terminations and resignations, regulatory reforms and lawsuits.Former Attorney General Maura Healey, who is now governor, announced the charges against Walsh and Clinton in September 2020, alleging that they made a series of decisions that ran counter to common infection control protocols and exacerbated COVID-19's toll inside the home.Healey called it ""the first criminal case in the country brought against those involved in nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic."" At least one other similar case has since been filed: in March, Los Angeles prosecutors filed charges against operators of a facility related to 14 deaths early in the pandemic.A spokesperson for Healey, who appealed the Superior Court dismissal of the indictments, did not comment Thursday.Healey's successor, Attorney General Andrea Campbell, praised the ruling.""The Court's decision today is welcome and important news, and it affirms what we already knew: the leaders and managers of facilities like the Soldiers' Home share responsibility for the health and safety of their residents,"" Campbell said in a statement. ""Today's decision allows us to focus once again on securing accountability for the tragic and preventable deaths at the Soldiers' Home in Holyoke.""Campbell's office said the decision returns the case to Hampden Superior Court, where Walsh and Clinton will each face five counts of caretaker who wantonly or recklessly commits or permits abuse, neglect or mistreatment to an elder or disabled person.Michael Jennings, an attorney who represented Walsh, said it is ""important to remember that this decision is very limited.""""It only involves the question of whether the grand jury heard enough evidence to support probable cause to 'arrest' or in this case to accuse by indictment. The grand jury process is a closed, one sided process,"" Jennings said in a statement to the News Service. ""The subject and/or counsel are not present. No cross examination of witnesses. Hearsay is admissible and much of this presentation was based on hearsay. No opportunity for the subject of the grand jury inquiry to present contrary evidence. And there is plenty of it. The court found that there was enough evidence presented to the grand jury to support a finding of probable cause.""He pointed to footnotes in the majority ruling in which justices emphasize that the question they sought to answer was not whether the defendants ""did the best they could,"" and to another footnote in the dissent in which Lowy wrote that Walsh was primarily an administrator who relied on medical professionals to make the decision to consolidate patients.""We've been preparing for trial. We'll be ready to challenge the Commonwealth's evidence in a public courtroom in front of a jury when that opportunity comes,"" Jennings added.Said Jeffrey Pyle, an attorney for Clinton: ""The dissent eloquently explains why this prosecution is misguided, and why Dr. Clinton is not guilty. We look forward to clearing his name at trial.""",Local,"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 16:27:11 EST",a25aa7b96451df7ae53a01f8869e84ee,NARENDRA MODI,"[('Thomas Guy', 0.26670047640800476), ('New Jersey Amateur Golf Championship', 0.2625093162059784), ('Shiv Manhas', 0.2616507411003113), ('Douglas De Pietro', 0.26148179173469543), ('Mays Landing', 0.26136481761932373), ('BRANCHBURG', 0.25684216618537903), ('Wyckoff', 0.25664275884628296), ('Clark Holle', 0.2563619911670685), ('Ridgewood', 0.25610122084617615), ('Hopewell', 0.2556942105293274)]",ENTERTAINMENT,"[('Royal Navy', 0.32074132561683655), (""Cherelle Locklear's"", 0.30628418922424316), ('the Citizens for Responsiblity and Ethics in Washington', 0.30408433079719543), ('Citizens for Ethics', 0.30310511589050293), ('Mnunchin', 0.3029831647872925), ('The Royal Foundation of the', 0.2953672409057617), ('the Classroom Assessment Scoring System', 0.29507890343666077), ('anti-DeSantis', 0.2940310537815094), ('the United States Bullion Depository', 0.2930237352848053), ('Earl Tomblin', 0.2911796569824219)]",SOCCER,"[('Tebas', 0.31958380341529846), ('Adam Kemp', 0.31402260065078735), ('Joanna Stahl', 0.31285423040390015), ('Diet Cokes', 0.30326852202415466), ('Pebble Beach,$60,000 1992', 0.30062541365623474), ('Stahl', 0.2957625985145569), ('Wilmer Cabrera', 0.2924965023994446), ('the Lakeland Classic', 0.292398065328598), ('Go2Practice', 0.289610892534256), ('Fracesco Molinari', 0.2895776331424713)]",ANIMALS,"[('the #FIFAWWC19 to', 0.3386934697628021), ('Ngozi Ebere', 0.32982903718948364), ('Viviane Asseyi', 0.3234734535217285), ('Renard', 0.3208256959915161), ('Simon Rolfes', 0.3171340823173523), ('Chiamaka Nnadozie', 0.3171211779117584), ('Ebere', 0.3160300850868225), ('Nnadozie', 0.31552016735076904), ('\u200bNaeher', 0.30845969915390015), ('Guingamp', 0.30548095703125)]"
19,What went wrong at Silicon Valley Bank? The Fed is set to release a postmortem report,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/04/28/what-went-wrong-at-silicon-valley-bank-the-fed-is-set-to-release-a-postmortem-report,"It's been six weeks since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank threatened to kick off a nationwide bank run. Now, U.S. regulators are due to issue their postmortem reports.","It's been six weeks since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank threatened to kick off a nationwide bank run. Now, U.S. regulators are due to issue their postmortem reports.The Federal Reserve plans to release a report Friday on whether there were lapses in its oversight of Silicon Valley Bank that may have contributed to the bank's failure. Separately, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. will also report Friday on how the regulator supervised New York-based Signature Bank, which failed days after the Silicon Valley lender. The sudden implosion of two big regional banks rattled nerves throughout the financial system last month, forcing the federal government to take emergency steps to prevent a nationwide bank run. Here are a few things to watch ahead of those two reports.What did the Fed know – and when did it know it? It was a ""textbook case of mismanagement."" That was how Michael Barr, the Fed's vice chair for supervision, described the failure of Silicon Valley Bank during Senate testimony last month.But the Fed has also promised to examine whether gaps in its own oversight allowed problems at the bank to fester.Supervisors from the Federal Reserve had sounded warnings about risk management practices at Silicon Valley Bank as early as 2021, but the problems weren't corrected. It's not clear why the warnings weren't treated more urgently by bank management – or higher-ups at the Fed. ""We need to have humility, and conduct a careful and thorough review of how we supervised and regulated this firm, and what we should learn from this experience,"" said Barr, in announcing the Fed's internal audit of what happened at Silicon Valley Bank.Dennis Kelleher, who heads the watchdog group Better Markets, blames a deregulatory push in recent years that promoted a light touch on bank oversight. ""The Wall Street Journal had a big headline in 2018 that said, 'Banks To Get Kinder, Gentler Treatment Under Trump Regulators,'"" Kelleher said. ""The entire story was about how the Fed people in Washington were beating up on the supervisors to go easy on the bankers.""The report is also expected to address whether mid-sized banks should be subject to more frequent ""stress tests,"" to ensure they can weather financial challenges. Currently, only the biggest banks — with at least $250 billion in assets — have to undergo a stress test every year. That threshold was raised in 2019, sparing institutions the size of Silicon Valley Bank from the additional scrutiny. Whose deposits are protected?Signature Bank in New York was shuttered two days after Silicon Valley Bank. The FDIC is due to examine whether there were any issues with how it supervised the East Coast lender.Both banks had a large share of deposits that exceeded the usual FDIC insurance limit of $250,000 — putting them at high risk of rapid withdrawals if customers got spooked.With emergency approval from the Treasury Secretary and the Fed, the FDIC agreed to insure all deposits at the two failed banks, regardless of the limit. That helped to discourage a wider bank run, but backstopping the uninsured deposits will cost the FDIC's insurance fund an estimated $19.6 billion. The money will be recovered through a special assessment on other banks. Now, policymakers may explore changes in the deposit insurance system. Some have argued the $250,000 cap on insured deposits is too low, especially for businesses with large payrolls. But insuring unlimited deposits would be costly. The ten largest accounts at Silicon Valley Bank held a total of $13.3 billion. Changing the insurance limit would require Congressional action. The FDIC is expected to spell out policy options in a separate report next week. What about beyond these two reports?Fears of a nationwide bank run have eased since last month, but the episode has left lingering scars. In the days following the banks' failure, other small banks saw a record outflow of deposits totaling $119 billion. Although deposits have since stabilized at most banks, lenders are expected to be more cautious about extending credit. That caution, along with higher interest rates, creates an additional drag on economic growth, and it's leading to a growing risk of a recession later this year.""Every borrower across the country — small, medium and large — is going to find it much more difficult and much more expensive to get credit,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""The economy's going to be materially weaker than it likely would have been without the SVB and Signature failures.""
