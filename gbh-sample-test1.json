Dominick Pangallo, a former mayoral chief of staff, and former Salem Mayor Neil Harrington finished Tuesday\u2019s race with a comfortable margin over the three other candidates. Whoever emerges as the winner in the final election on May 16, it\u2019ll be the first time a new mayor is elected in Salem since 2005. Former Mayor Kim Driscoll stepped away from her fifth term when she was sworn in as Massachusetts\u2019 lieutenant governor in January.Pangallo, who served as former Mayor Kim Driscoll\u2019s chief of staff up until January 2022, said he\u2019s thrilled by the outcome of the preliminary election. He collected more than 40% of the vote, the highest among the candidates, according to unofficial results released by the city. \u201cIt\u2019s a pivotal moment for Salem, and I feel strongly that we can\u2019t go backwards,\u201d he told GBH News Wednesday. \u201cWe have a strong foundation to build on and keep moving our city forward as a place that works for everyone.\u201dHarrington, who served as Salem\u2019s mayor from 1990 to 1997, did not respond to GBH News\u2019 requests for comment. He took in nearly a third of the vote, per the unofficial tally, and is running on preserving Salem\u2019s economic future as well as keeping Salem\u2019s Peabody Essex Museum from moving to Boston. Pangallo said some of the top issues facing Salem are affordability and housing. He also wants to smooth the transition with new projects coming to the city, making sure that the city benefits from the new jobs an in-development offshore wind terminal while managing the project\u2019s impact on surrounding neighborhoods. Former City Councilor Stephen Dibble finished third with 14% of the vote, acting Mayor and Ward 5 City Councilor Robert McCarthy was fourth with 8%, and activist Stacia Kraft came in fifth with just under 3% at 188 votes.Kraft tells GBH News that she \u201cwent into the race with no illusions\u201d and said there are crucial issues that she hopes remain potent for the final election. \u201cWe have nine planned developments for our flood zones and Salem is only eight square miles. And we now are moving towards privatizing the Salem Housing Authority,\u201d she said. \u201cSo giving over our elderly and disabled residents to for-profit corporations, these are two very big issues.\u201dKraft was the only candidate without a political background. Pangallo attributes his win in the preliminary election to a strong field campaign, having knocked on almost 5,000 doors. He said that kind of grassroots effort is what helped him win 11 of the 14 precincts in Salem and he hopes will give him victory in May.\u201cI feel like the results in that preliminary election were a strong indication that our community is one that wants to keep moving forward as a place that's innovative and professionally managed.\u201dCampaign finance reports show both Pangallo and Harrington spent tens of thousands of dollars on the race. Pangallo spent nearly $28,000 since the beginning of November, while Harrington spent nearly $46,000. Both Pangallo and Harrington outspent the other candidates at least four times over.As of the end of February, Pangallo had just over $42,000 cash on hand, closely matched by Harrington\u2019s nearly $41,000.", "content_id": "17816d27022ee9ef1ab11a84952f3aa7", "hl1": "Pangallo, Harrington move ahead in Salem\u2019s special mayoral preliminary", "hl2": "The two Salem City Hall alums will face off on May 16, vying to replace Kim Driscoll after she led the city for more than 15 years.", "meta": {"copyright": "", "issue_number": "", "volume": ""}, "topic": "Local", "pub_date": "Wed, 29 Mar 2023 17:01:24 EST", "pub_name": "GBH", "link": "https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/29/pangallo-harrington-move-ahead-in-salems-special-mayoral-preliminary", "census_tracts": [{"Salem City Hall": {"county_name": "Census Tract 2045, Essex County, Massachusetts", "tract": "204500", "geoid_tract": "25009204500", "demographics": {"p2_001n": "3537", "p2_002n": "422", "p2_003n": "3115", "p2_004n": "2947", "p2_005n": "2763", "p2_006n": "87", "p2_007n": "0", "p2_008n": "83", "p2_009n": "0", "p2_010n": "14"}}}]}, "98ccfbb1122dd9e96761ab9bb3896302": {"author": "", "body": "Nonprofit leaders and local activists in Worcester say the city\u2019s process for awarding federal COVID-19 relief funding to community groups has been inequitable, arguing that a significant chunk of the money is going to large organizations that already have sufficient support.Late last year, the city of Worcester accepted applications from local nonprofits and other organizations for about $10 million in American Rescue Plan Act money, meant to address issues like food insecurity in communities most impacted by the pandemic.City Manager Eric Batista, who\u2019s overseeing all ARPA decisions, previously told GBH News that Worcester\u2019s application review process would prioritize smaller organizations that have struggled in the past to secure grant funding. But although some of the ARPA money recently went to newer groups trying to expand, others were left out \u2014 an exclusion nonprofit leaders worry comes at the expense of the people, often of color, who would benefit from their services. \u201cThis is what the system keeps doing,\u201d said Derrick Kiser, who did not receive any ARPA money for his nonprofit Fresh Start, which provides mental health counseling to at-risk youth and young adults. \u201cThe same system continues to feed the same organizations and the same people.\u201dAccording to a GBH News review of publicly available tax data, more than 60% of the total $11.7 million in ARPA money for projects and programming was awarded to larger, more established organizations with at least $400,000 in annual funding.In an interview, Batista argued the city carefully considered all of the 140 applications and awarded the money fairly to a diverse array of groups. He said organizations that didn\u2019t receive any funding will have opportunities in the future to secure city grants.Worcester received $146 million in ARPA funds in 2021. Then-City Manager Edward Augustus appointed residents to committees that would review applications for some of the funding. At the urging of local activists, the city held multiple rounds of community outreach to seek feedback on how to make the awarding process fair and equitable, then hosted workshops to walk prospective applicants through the process. When Kiser applied in the fall last year, he saw the ARPA money as an opportunity to expand his nonprofit Fresh Start, which has served more than 300 people since its founding in 2018. Kiser has used his experience as a former Worcester gang leader to help formerly incarcerated people assimilate back into society and sway youth to leave gangs. But his annual budget has usually been no more than $150,000, which makes it hard for him to broaden his reach. With the help of the Seven Hills Foundation, Kiser filled out three separate lengthy applications for the ARPA money to help fund different programs at his nonprofit. Each application was for $250,000, the maximum organizations could request for a programming initiative. Although he\u2019s struggled in the past to secure other city grants, Kiser said city officials had told him Fresh Start was the exact type of nonprofit they\u2019d prioritize for pandemic relief money.\u201cWe would use that money getting two case managers to help assist [clients], provide them with life skills, communication skills, financial literacy ... de-escalation skills,\u201d Kiser said. \u201cAnd then literally transportation,\u201d bringing them to jobs.But the city rejected all of his applications with no explanation why.Charles Luster also was hopeful. His organization, 2Gether We Eat, employs hydroponic farming to provide fresh produce to lower-income families across the Worcester area. But Luster said although the Worcester Regional Chamber of Commerce completed his application for him, he was also denied funding.So was Dan Ford, whose nonprofit trains homeless and other underprivileged young people how to restore cars so they can pursue that work as a stable career. Ford previously tried to convert a vacant Worcester manufacturing building into a youth community and vocational hub, known as The Bridge. But after Ford lost out on a bid to purchase the building, he settled on a new plan to expand his auto repair shop into a job training center with apartments for homeless youth.\u201cI know what it is to sleep in an alleyway overnight, freezing cold with a leather jacket and some jeans on,\u201d said Ford, who spent about a decade in out and out homelessness while growing up in Worcester.He thought the ARPA funding could help jumpstart his project, so he hired an experienced grant writer to help him apply. He said he was disappointed but not surprised when he received his rejection letter from Worcester in February.\u201cIt\u2019s business as usual for [the] city of Worcester. ... It\u2019s a slap in the face,\u201d Ford said. \u201cIt\u2019s pure neglect of a community.\u201d Nelly Medina, a local community organizer who founded the social justice nonprofit Free Worcester, said the ARPA funding decisions exemplify the city\u2019s favoritism of deep-pocketed organizations over small, younger ones often led by people of color. Medina believes Worcester\u2019s marginalized residents lose out when the smaller organizations representing them aren\u2019t given a chance. \u201cThe grassroots efforts that are coming from the people on the ground are the ones that are scoffed at,\u201d said Medina, whose group did not apply for ARPA funding. \u201cThese organizations that were looked over are some of the most respected in the community. ... It\u2019s a huge injustice.\u201dIn a February memo to City Council, Worcester City Manager Eric Batista said his administration received over 140 applications requesting more than a combined $40 million in funding, far more than what was allotable. In response, Batista said he slightly increased the ARPA money available for the applicants \u201cto provide additional funding in support of these critical projects and programs.\u201dStill, considering the high demand for the money, nonprofit leaders and activists question why so much of it went to larger organizations with deep budgets. For example, UMass Chan Medical School has received hundreds of millions of dollars in donations and research funding in recent years but was awarded $225,000 in ARPA money for its Lifeline for Kids program, which helps children recover from trauma.And Worcester Community Action Council, which works to address poverty across the region, received the maximum $250,000 in ARPA programming money even though the organization secured more than $40 million in total funding in 2022.Worcester Community Action Council Executive Director Marybeth Campbell told GBH News she agrees with people\u2019s frustration about the ARPA decisions. In fact, she considered not applying for the money because her organization already benefits from being large and well-established. However, she ended up submitting an application to use the ARPA money for a universal basic income pilot program, in which 50 families will receive direct cash payments for a few years.Officials at UMass Chan deferred to the city for comments about the ARPA funding decisions. Batista and Worcester Chief Development Officer Peter Dunn said the ARPA review committee appropriately accounted for the size and background of applicants. They added the city tried to award organizations the amount of money they asked for, as long as it didn\u2019t significantly exceed their current budgets.\u201cLet\u2019s say if the organization has an annual budget of $50,000 and they request $250,000, then maybe that impacted them in terms of the realisticness of being able to accomplish that and manage that amount of money,\u201d Dunn said.Activists and nonprofit leaders said these doubts about smaller organizations\u2019 ability to manage grant funding are typical among Worcester officials and the greater philanthropic community.But the ARPA money is meant to be used creatively and has more flexible requirements, said Ben Wood, a senior director with Boston-based Health Resources in Action, which works to make philanthropy more fair. He noted that if the city had doubts about some applicants\u2019 capacity to manage money, it could have hired a consultant to help them.Instead, Wood and activists said Worcester\u2019s consideration of the size of applicants\u2019 budgets could have resulted in larger organizations with deeper pockets automatically qualifying for more money over smaller nonprofits. Some city councilors agreed Worcester officials didn\u2019t take advantage of an opportunity to use the ARPA money for organizations that usually struggle to receive funding.\u201cThe process wasn\u2019t set up to be equitable,\u201d City Councilor Etel Haxhiaj said. \u201cIt creates a mistrust between community and our local government.\u201dShe and Councilor Khrystian King said city officials\u2019 next step should be to review and analyze the ARPA decision-making process to avoid the same pattern with future grant money. Haxhiaj added the city needs to \u201cremedy some of the hurt and harm that was caused.\u201d", "content_id": "98ccfbb1122dd9e96761ab9bb3896302", "hl1": "'A huge injustice': Worcester denies several small nonprofits ARPA funding", "hl2": "The city recently announced which organizations it's awarding the federal pandemic relief money to.", "meta": {"copyright": "", "issue_number": "", "volume": ""}, "topic": "Local", "pub_date": "Wed, 29 Mar 2023 09:59:55 EST", "pub_name": "GBH", "link": "https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/29/a-huge-injustice-worcester-denies-several-small-nonprofits-arpa-funding", "census_tracts": []}, "3547f23273aaa28d8dee7a764acb7b8b": {"author": "", "body": "The city of Boston is grieving the loss of Melvin Herbert King, who died yesterday at the age of 94. Mel King was a nationally known civil rights icon, lawmaker and the first Black mayoral candidate to advance to a general election in Boston. King is being remembered now for his work as a longtime community organizer and his lasting effect on the city and state politics by the many who knew him, including GBH News\u2019 senior investigative reporter Phillip Martin, who joined GBH\u2019s Morning Edition hosts Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel to share his memories. This transcript has been lightly edited. Paris Alston: This is a really huge, devastating loss of someone who lived a remarkable life. Phillip, tell us what Mel King represented in the context of Boston history. Phillip Martin: Well, I think everything. I mean, he defined it over a lifetime. I mean, 94 years: activist, community organizer, change-maker. When a lot of people think about Boston, they think about two things, historically speaking. They think about the city that's defined by its revolutionary provenance, you know, the 18th century. And they also think about it as a city defined by the busing of the 1970s. But King sort of represented this arc of 20th- and 21st-century history \u2014 its racial and class intolerance for sure, but also the fight against racism. He represents the city's current multiracial political hierarchy, as opposed to what we've seen in the past. Jeremy Siegel: You used that phrase \u201cthe arc of history,\u201d referencing what King represented as a community activist and as a lawmaker. Tell us a little bit more about the transformation that he was part of in the city of Boston. Martin: Absolutely. People drive every day down Dartmouth Street and they see these apartments called the Tent City Apartments. And I'm not sure how many people think about how that got there, because you're looking at an apartment complex that's a mixed-income housing complex in the heart of Boston, Copley Square, where you actually have low-income people living there. This was the result of a protest that began in the late \u201960s against the Boston Redevelopment Authority, led by Mel King. The intention of the city, the BRA at the time \u2014 the Boston Redevelopment Authority \u2014 was to build this garage. And King led this protest culminating in this dedicated, quality living community, eponymously called Tent City Apartments. That was Mel King! Alston: That was one of the first things I learned when I was learning about Mel King upon moving here.Martin: That's right. This originated from this popular protest against gentrification. You have to think about Mel King, in answer to your question, his 10 years as a state representative elected in 1973, in the midst of extraordinary racial turmoil. And we also have to think about Mel King \u2014 at that time, you had this deep reactionary political leadership in the '70s, represented by people like Louise Day Hicks, a city councilor and former congressperson. And King formed this Rainbow Coalition, a campaign for mayor in 1983 that was sort of an adjacent to what was happening on the national level with Jesse Jackson. And here is an interview with Mel King in 1983. This interview was conducted by reporter Gail Harris, and it's King explaining why he was running for mayor. And this explains it all.[Previously recorded] Mel King: I can remember a time when I went to do an errand and came back with a man following. And it was cold. And he came to the door and I ran in and my father saw him. And the man said that he was hungry and cold, came in and was fed, warmed and given some food on his way. And I'll never forget that. My father said, \u201cNo matter what you have, a little, you always have enough to share.\u201d It's kind of stuck with me all of my life. [Recording ends]Martin: So you have this powerful, very tall, soft-spoken man who was just absolutely compassionate. And as another example, final example of this: When I was working with Oxfam America, and at this time it was located in the Bay Village, Mel King worked with us on outreach programs, not just to the city, but to Haiti, Nicaragua and Southern Africa in the 1980s. Alston: So many milestones throughout his life there, Phillip. And, you know, another thing that I would hear about Mel King was was how much community organizing was part of just who he was as a person, his everyday life. He was in the streets during protests. He was in the State House legislating, but he was also welcoming people into his own house to organize and to talk about the issues of the day. So tell us a little bit about those famous Sunday brunches he would have in the South End. Martin: Oh, yeah. Besides the good food, I think everyone listening who's been to Mel King's house knows exactly what I'm talking about. You had food, you had laughs, but you also had serious discussion. People would strategize about, for example, in the '80s, about Boston's anti-apartheid movement to improve the position of Black and brown workers in the city. He would have people at the house from from organizations like the Chinese Progressive Association. He also represented the community at MIT. He ran this Community Fellows program. He was this true coalition builder, coalitions that stretched across racial lines. Many activists can say they are the children, if you will, of Mel King. As I said, he was close to Jesse Jackson, whose own Rainbow Coalition actually echoed Mel King's on a national level in terms of successful coalition-building. That's what I can say about him. Siegel: And real quickly, before we let you go, Phillip, what legacy does Mel King leave behind? Martin: In many ways, he's leaving a lot behind. But he's also pushing a lot of things forward, even his 1983 book. It has been basically re-formed to reflect the times. And that was at the insistence of young activists in this area. He also left behind these legacy at the at the South End Settlements \u2014 the South End Technology Center, for example, which he started in 1997. But most importantly, his six children and his wife, Joyce, are a beautiful family. They welcomed you into their home.

In politics, his endorsement was highly sought after by candidates seeking credibility with Boston\u2019s Black community.King was born in Boston\u2019s South End neighborhood, which in the mid-20th century represented the heart of the city\u2019s Black population. He graduated from what is now the John D. O\u2019Bryant School of Mathematics and Science, then-Boston Tech. King was first elected to public office in 1973 to the state Legislature representing Suffolk County. He lost to Ray Flynn in the 1983 mayoral election. That run in 1983 would end up inspiring people like Tito Jackson, who ran for the office in 2017. He said he remembers being 8 years old, seeing a large Black man \u2014 in every sense of that word \u2014 speaking the truth. He said the Mel King way of organizing a coalition, across race and income, informed his own run. \u201cAs sad of a moment as this is, it also means that Mel King lived an impactful life that touched the lives of tens of thousands \u2014 and maybe hundreds of thousands \u2014 of people,\u201d Jackson said. State Sen. Lydia Edwards, a frequent visitor to King\u2019s Sunday brunches, said his passing marks the end of the city\u2019s radically loving activists.\u201cI\u2019m really sad because we don\u2019t have any more Mels, not even a pipeline for Mels at all,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was a universal uniter, above the geographic division, above class division, race \u2014 he was the one all organizers could look to and know his heart was the purest.\u201dKing endorsed Edwards during her first, unsuccessful run for state Senate in 2016.For Boston City Councilor Kendra Lara, King guided her political organizing from a young age. As a state Representative, he helped the People Before Highways movement, a movement that put a stop to government attempts to extend the I-95 through Roxbury. Residents\u2019 fierce pushback put 2,000 protesters on the street in 1969, which halted the development and ultimately led to the Orange Line being brought into those neighborhoods instead. \u201cWhen I learned that story \u2014 when I was in the sixth grade \u2014 is when I realized that people who looked like me and the people in my neighborhood had power. That if we could stop a 10-lane highway from cutting through our neighborhood, that there was absolutely nothing that we couldn\u2019t do,\u201d said Lara, who now represents Jamaica Plain and West Roxbury. \u201cAnd Mel King is a part of that legacy.\u201cWhen I think about my community, it exists in the way it does because of him,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd when I think about my generation of organizers \u2014 and when I think about the generation of Black and brown young people who grew up in movements, who grew up fighting to make sure that their community had a voice and power in what our neighborhoods looked like \u2014 it is because people like Mel King set the standard.\u201d\u201cFor decades, Mel King taught us all how to serve, how to build, and how to love,\u201d Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said in a statement Tuesday night. \u201cOn behalf of the City of Boston, we send our deepest condolences to the King family and the many, many loved ones, mentees, and friends of Mel. With gratitude and determination to keep fighting, Rest in Power.\u201d\u201cMel King is an iconic figure for Boston, not just in the Black community, but Boston overall because he knew how to bring people together,\u201d said Bishop William E. Dickerson II, a friend of King\u2019s. \u201cI know that his impact is going to be missed deeply by so many people, so many sectors, of our communities.\u201d Michael King, one of King\u2019s six children, is the director of the South End Technology Center, which the elder King founded in 1997. He says his father was part of the solution that helped pave the way to make Boston's leadership more diverse.\u201cYou know, he was part of the solution to get us to be able to accept that any person who has done their homework and does their homework can reach any point in life,\u201d he said. King said he wanted to honor his father and rejoice in his life.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything to be sad about. We miss him, but that\u2019s the selfish part of us, you know?\u201d said Michael King. \u201cI feel like I was blessed to be, you know \u2014 have a chance to, you know \u2014 be in this time, next to someone who took his journey so seriously.\u201d This story has been updated to include additional comments and information.", "content_id": "abd0cad63eee6071b83fb12fbd183666", "hl1": "Mel King dies at 94", "hl2": "King was a longtime community advocate and Boston\u2019s first Black mayoral candidate to advance to a general election.", "meta": {"copyright": "", "issue_number": "", "volume": ""}, "topic": "Local", "pub_date": "Tue, 28 Mar 2023 20:56:40 EST", "pub_name": "GBH", "link": "https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/28/mel-king-dies-at-94", "census_tracts": []}, "4af106bbb3cc3c5ddd730e2984c225b4": {"author": "", "body": "The state's governing document still only refers to elected officials by male pronouns. And while the process to change that language would be lengthy, this is the year to start because \"history has blown by the Massachusetts Constitution,\" according to one lawmaker.Voters last November elected the state's first all-women executive team, which followed Lt. Gov. Jane Swift's groundbreaking run as acting governor in the early 2000s, and three other female lieutenant governors dating back to Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy in 1987.\"Perhaps that begs the question, why bother? Clearly, the Constitution's existing language had little impact on the recent electoral fortunes of women. But words matter,\" first-term Rep. Jenny Armini of Marblehead told the Judiciary Committee. \"Language is a signal to the world. It's how we communicate our values. And it's a tool by which citizens learn who, and what, is important.\"While the titles are used infrequently and many people simply refer to Healey as \"governor,\" the Constitution directs people to refer to the governor by the honorific of \"His Excellency,\" and to the lieutenant governor as \"His Honor.\"The governor's title is one piece of Massachusetts' British-colonial past that John Adams apparently considered worth preserving in the modern era when he drafted a new state Constitution in 1780.The Judiciary Committee is weighing two proposed amendments filed by Armini (H 30 / H 31) that would add female and gender-neutral pronouns, like \"Her Excellency\" and \"Their Honor,\" to refer to the state's leaders. Other amendments before the committee would open up the language in the rest of the Constitution so that it does not exclusively use male pronouns.Gov. Maura Healey told reporters Tuesday afternoon that she hadn't heard about the proposals.\"I think people know how to refer to me, they refer to me in a lot of different ways,\" Healey said.The governor also made some light of the 18th century language.\"I guess Abigail didn't have a hand in that,\" said Healey, apparently referring to Abigail Adams, who famously implored her husband John to \"remember the ladies\" in his public policy work.\"Where was she? She wasn't at home that day,\" Healey quipped.After 20 years of male governors, it is probably more out of habit, than by strict adherence to the Constitution, that there's an occasional reference to the governor this year using male pronouns.As the Senate sent its first big bill to Healey's desk this month, Majority Leader Cindy Creem said it would be \"laid before the governor for his approbation.\"An aide stepped up toward the rostrum. \"Her,\" he interjected toward the microphone.Creem often presided over formal sessions during Gov. Charlie Baker's administration, hence a possible slip of the tongue on the routine script.When the presiding senator sends bills to the governor for \"approbation,\" the language mirrors a section of the Constitution about how a governor can \"signify his approbation\" of a bill or resolve by signing it.A separate amendment filed by Sen. Will Brownsberger (S 10) deals more extensively with gender references to the governor and lieutenant governor throughout the Constitution. Brownsberger's proposal would replace other instances of male-only pronouns with \"he or she\" and \"his or her,\" including the section about bill-signings.Armini's proposals are more targeted than Brownsberger's, focusing on the honorific titles, but they also account for more gender possibilities.Explaining inclusion of \"their\" pronouns in her amendments, Armini called for lawmakers to look toward a future day when \"someone unencumbered by gender, or gender assigned at birth, sits in the corner office.\"She referred to Rep. Sam Monta\u00f1o, another first-term House member who uses both female and nonbinary pronouns, as one politician who is \"full of promise.\"First-term Rep. Dawne Shand of Newburyport recalled, as a high school student in Alabama, her teacher saying that male pronouns in government documents were appropriately \"encompassing\" of all.Shand disagreed, as did Rep.

The memo listed key principles for redistricting, including \u201cpopulation equality, minority voting rights, compactness, contiguity and preservation of neighborhoods.\u201d\u201c[The council\u2019s] primary objective,\u201d Flaherty argued, was \u201cpopulation balancing\u201d \u2014 which is basically making sure each district contained an equal number of voters. That goal, he testified, was largely achieved during a September working session. In that session, all councilors except one, Ricardo Arroyo, toyed with voting district boundaries according to newly drawn precincts, the units that compose the city\u2019s nine voting districts. Rather than adhering to the equal population charge, Flaherty said his council colleagues eventually disregarded the changes of that working session and erroneously considered racial demographics as they sought to rearrange the city\u2019s nearly 300 precincts according to the latest U.S. Census figures. \u201cWe didn\u2019t need to do anything else,\u201d he said repeatedly.Toward the end of his three-hour testimony, Flaherty said he feels the council\u2019s \u201crushed\u201d adoption of the map created another vulnerability: it opens up the council to accusations of incumbent protection. The late adoption, he said, would make it very difficult for an aspiring City Council candidate to determine what district they reside in and take the necessary steps to challenge a sitting councilor. Those seeking to run in the upcoming election can begin declaring their intent to run as soon as April 19, a fact that dawned on Judge Patti B. Saris as Flaherty wrapped up.\"I need to have this done by the end of April?\" she asked the attorneys, noting a prior impression of no urgent deadline for the case. Flaherty\u2019s testimony was punctuated by stints of searching for exhibits and murmurs and snickering from onlookers in the audience, mostly from local political advocacy groups who support Boston\u2019s new map. At one point, Judge Saris warned the onlookers to be quiet, or be ejected from the courtroom.Lawyers for the city did not produce a witness, but in opening statements said that the case amounted to a mere political dispute.\u201cThis case is ultimately about choices,\u201d said attorney Jennifer Grace Miller. The final map, she said, made \u201cmodest\u201d changes to the city's last map, was approved through the proper municipal channels and left a contingent of residents unsatisfied.Plaintiffs challenging the city map are scheduled to present more witnesses, including veteran Congressman Stephen Lynch, whose district contains a portion of South Boston. The case is an outgrowth of a state court case brought by a coalition of South Boston residents and community groups who tried to stop the council from approving the map last year. The case was later amended to include the latest arguments, then eventually moved to federal court and revised to include new plaintiffs. Boston saw an explosion of growth in its newly built Seaport neighborhood over the last decade. The area sits within the city\u2019s second voting district, requiring the boundaries to shift and shed population. At the same time, the city\u2019s third district, anchored in Dorchester, needed to pick up voters. Councilor Arroyo, who was stripped of chairmanship of the city\u2019s redistricting committee amid last year\u2019s messy Democratic primary for Suffolk County district attorney, attended Tuesday\u2019s hearing and said his colleague\u2019s testimony illustrated \u201cjust how frivolous the lawsuit actually is.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s very telling that not a single expert is on the witness list for the plaintiffs \u2026 and I think it\u2019s pretty clear at this point that there\u2019s no real law this lawsuit is standing on,\" he said.

This insect song was the inspiration Vinh Le needed to open his first restaurant space.\u201cCicada is summer,\u201d Le, the co-owner of Cicada Coffee Bar, told Boston Public Radio at the Boston Public Library on Tuesday. \u201cCicadas remind me about my childhood, about the times I relaxed.\u201d Vinh Le and his life and business partner Duong Huynh, have created a restaurant at 106 Prospect St. that doubles as a community space, where patrons can slow down, connect and share food and drinks in the heart of Cambridge. Ten years ago, Le left Vietnam for the U.S. to attend architecture school at Columbia University. During the pandemic, Le\u2019s life slowed down and he decided he wanted to open a restaurant. But not just any restaurant \u2014 he wanted every aspect of the space to be tailored to the Cambridge community. The funky lighting, the handmade plates and the mid-century modern furniture are all designed with Cambridge tastes in mind. Customers might recognize the mid-century modern chairs from their grandmother\u2019s house, Le said. Once in Cicada\u2019s cozy interior (after braving the line that often stacks up outside the restaurant), people consume locally sourced drinks and food inspired by Le\u2019s home country. Vietnamese food is defined by lots of fresh ingredients and herbs, Le said. The menu includes fresh summer rolls filled with vegetables, sushi rice with salmon and mushrooms, banh mi sandwiches and noodle salad with charred eggplant. The coffee is not to be missed. The sea salt shaker is the signature drink made with coffee, sea salt and condensed milk. All the ingredients are shaken vigorously in a cocktail shaker to create a frothy, milkshake-like beverage. \u201cThis is my performance,\u201d said Le, as he showed off his bartending skills and poured iced coffee for hosts Jim Braude and Margery Eagan.Vietnamese started using condensed milk in their coffee during the Vietnam War, said Le, when they didn\u2019t have access to fresh milk. In addition to sweet caffeine, Cicada serves hot tea brewed with fresh ginger and lemongrass, plus homemade hot sauce. Le's innovation has been recognized, it was announced in January that he is a semifinalist for the Emerging Chef James Beard Award. The short list of James Beard Award nominees will be announced Mar. 29. When asked whether the nomination puts a burden on his shoulders, Le said he wasn\u2019t bothered. He plans to continue cooking and creating community at Cicada no matter what happens. Still, he acknowledged it\u2019s still stressful owning and operating a new restaurant. But this stress leads to hard work and creativity, said Le. To balance the stress Le said he practices living in the moment, whether it is cooking food or picking up a shift for a sick coworker.

Commission executive director Shaplaie Brooks emphasized the commonwealth\u2019s legacy of pioneering social initiatives and the necessity that it remain at the vanguard of progressivism: Massachusetts is the first state to have such a commission centered on the wellbeing of LGBTQ youth. But the commission is counted as but one victory, and Brooks was vocal about the need for continuous political engagement. She pointed to the nationwide statistics: 434 bills in U.S. state legislatures target LGBTQ people, according to a tracker from the ACLU. \u201cConsider this the home base for the national march that\u2019s in Washington this Friday,\u201d Brooks exclaimed during her remarks.

Commission vice chair Noemi Uribe reiterated that the state should focus on proactive legislation to combat this antagonism: \u201cEven though we don't have legislation or filed bills right now that are anti-LGBTQ or anti-trans, that activity is still something we need to listen to, and we need to call on legislators to pass protections to prevent anything from happening.\u201d Despite the energy at the rally, the event was also an indicator of the remaining work to be done: in the crowd there was a conspicuous lack of Black youth, something that co-chair Craig Martin acknowledged. \u201cOur youth of color don\u2019t always have the spaces where they can feel brave and be public, because they are generally the ones who are most targeted, experience the most violence, and actually seem to be invisible in the very sphere of the community,\u201d he said. \u201cNot having them here means we still have a lot more work to do to create a brave space for them to come out and just be in community.\u201d A part of that work includes the commission\u2019s annual report, due April 27, that provides \u201cevidence-based and community-sourced recommendations\u201d to both the state Legislature and statewide agencies, outlining policies and programs to secure the well-being of LGBTQ youth.", "content_id": "ccc7ae8aa138f896ad4a161ecafb4358", "hl1": "\u2018Consider this the home base\u2019: State commission on LGBTQ youth hosts rally ahead of Trans Day of Visibility", "hl2": "Gathering at State House, commissioners and advocates shared goals and demands for the safety of LGBTQ youth.", "meta": {"copyright": "", "issue_number": "", "volume": ""}, "topic": "Local", "pub_date": "Tue, 28 Mar 2023 15:50:06 EST", "pub_name": "GBH", "link": "https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/28/consider-this-the-home-base-state-commission-on-lgbtq-youth-hosts-rally-ahead-of-trans-day-of-visibility", "census_tracts": [{"North American Indian Center of Boston": {"county_name": "Census Tract 811.01, Suffolk County, Massachusetts", "tract": "081101", "geoid_tract": "25025081101", "neighborhood": "Mission Hill", "demographics": {"p2_001n": "1484", "p2_002n": "158", "p2_003n": "1326", "p2_004n": "1263", "p2_005n": "806", "p2_006n": "154", "p2_007n": "0", "p2_008n": "299", "p2_009n": "0", "p2_010n": "4"}}}, {"Massachusetts State House": {"county_name": "Census Tract 203.02, Suffolk County, Massachusetts", "tract": "020302", "geoid_tract": "25025020302", "neighborhood": "Beacon Hill", "demographics": {"p2_001n": "1293", "p2_002n": "100", "p2_003n": "1193", "p2_004n": "1147", "p2_005n": "1007", "p2_006n": "42", "p2_007n": "0", "p2_008n": "90", "p2_009n": "0", "p2_010n": "8"}}}]}, "e184a22e87d176f44f444e4c8565660a": {"author": "", "body": "Phillip Eng was officially named as the new general manager of the MBTA, a job that comes with a number of significant challenges.

The agency can also boost Eng's base pay with yearly performance-based bonuses and what has been called an \u201cannual retention payment\u201d of $30,000.Last year, former MBTA General Manager Steve Poftak pulled in just over $417,000 between his base pay and bonuses.Eng's most recent public transit role was leading the Long Island Rail Road, the largest commuter line in the country.

So far in March, two skiers have died after accidents at Wachusett Mountain in Massachusetts and Pats Peak in New Hampshire, which included a 15-year-old boy. GBH legal analyst and Northeastern law professor Daniel Medwed joined Morning Edition hosts Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel to discuss the legal liability involved when people get injured on the slopes. This transcript has been lightly edited. Jeremy Siegel: So, Daniel, we know you love to ski. We also know there are dangers associated with skiing. There are also lots of legal issues, another one of your passions. When it comes to accidents on the slopes, to what extent might an injured skier, or a skier's family, be able to sue a resort and receive monetary compensation after an accident or something like it happens? Daniel Medwed: So it varies considerably from state to state. The law in Massachusetts is different from New Hampshire, which differs from that of Vermont. But the gist is basically the same. It's extremely difficult to sue a ski resort for your injuries. And here's why: the first barrier is basically contractual. When you buy that lift pass, that ski ticket, you essentially waive either implicitly or explicitly, your right to sue the mountain for certain risks inherent in the dangerous activity of downhill skiing. The second barrier is often baked into the law. It's part of our statutory framework. So, for instance, Massachusetts specifies in law what the duties of skiers are. This is actually part of our code. So, for instance, a skier shall maintain control of speed and course at all times, and a skier shall be presumed to know the range of their own ability on the slopes. So if you're going too fast, if you're out of control, if you're on that triple diamond black slope when you're really an intermediate skier, then you might be waiving any potential recourse for injuries against the mountain. Paris Alston: Daniel, I wonder if there are any ways to overcome these obstacles. Because it can be tricky, right? In the case of a skier at Wachusett Mountain, he hit a tree. And in the one of the 15-year-old boy at Pats Peak, he hit a bump on a trail that he had gone down a few times before previously. So what if the resort is maybe doing a bad job of maintaining the trails, or there's something else that's playing a role in creating a hazardous condition for the skier? Could you file a lawsuit in those situations? Medwed: Well, it really depends. I mean, these barriers are not insurmountable. It's not as if we give these ski mountains a complete free pass when it comes to liability. So there's a law in Massachusetts that's parallel to the duties of skiers, which imposes duties on ski resorts. Ski resorts have to conspicuously indicate the presence of snowmaking machines and other equipment to avert a potential crash. And also: they have to put flashing or rotating lights on emergency or maintenance vehicles. And I think a failure of the ski resort to comply, to breach that duty, could give rise to a personal injury action. But if that's the case, Paris and Jeremy, I think skiers really have to be mindful of another potential booby trap, which are there are often very strict statutes of limitations for skiers to bring an action against a ski resort. So in Massachusetts, you have to alert the mountain within 90 days, in writing by registered mail, about the accident and provide details about the accident or else you might waive your claim. And even then, you have to file your lawsuit within one year of the accident. Siegel: Everything you've said over the past couple of minutes makes it sound like the law is essentially stacked in favor of resorts. Medwed: Yeah, I think that's right. So on the one hand, I suppose the rationale here is that if there were not barriers on the liability for ski resorts, it would be too cost-prohibitive to ever operate a ski slope. The cost of insurance alone would be astronomical. And the only way you could make a go of it would be by passing the cost on to the consumer in the form of even higher lift tickets. We know how expensive they already are. On the other hand, I think it's a really fair question, and Jeremy, you allude to this, about whether the balance right now is tilted too far in favor of ski resorts. Alston: So, Daniel, you just mentioned the challenges with filing lawsuits against ski resorts, but a lot of accidents are a result of collisions with other skiers, right? I mean, Gwyneth Paltrow has been on the stand in Utah this week talking about this exact thing. Sometimes it's due to careless behavior by other skiers. Are there any restrictions on suing your fellow skiers for causing injuries to you? Medwed: Well, those actions are typically governed by general tort law or personal injury principles. So if another skier is negligent, maybe he or she has breached those duties of the skier that I mentioned, then perhaps that could give a basis for the injured party to file a tort action, a civil liability action, against that individual. So, for example, a bedrock principle of skiing, which is sometimes included in the law explicitly, is that a skier up the hill has an obligation to avoid a collision with a skier down the hill. It's a little bit like rear ending while driving, right? The person higher up bears the responsibility. And so if that skier does get into a collision with someone downhill, then conceivably that could give the basis for a private personal injury action. Siegel: But I guess that's sort of dependent on one skier actually stopping after the accident. Like I'm thinking of hit and runs in cars. Sometimes there's a collision and then the uphill skier might just keep going. Are there any consequences for leaving the scene of a skiing accident? Medwed: And regrettably, that happens all the time. And there are some consequences. So Massachusetts has a law on the books which says that you can get fined not less than $100 \u2014 It's not a huge fine but you can get fined \u2014 if you knowingly have an accident on a ski slope and then you depart without providing your personal identification or clearly identifying yourself to the person you've injured. Now, of course, that's dependent on someone actually catching you as you go down the mountain, some good Samaritan further down the slope. But there is a law on the books, at least in Massachusetts, to govern that. Alston: So it sounds like that's mostly civil liability or personal injury actions. But say a good Samaritan does catch you. Could you ever be found guilty of a crime for injuring someone on a ski slope? Medwed: There are cases out there, and they're relatively rare, of criminal actions that derive from accidents on ski slopes. There's a relatively famous case from Vail Resort in Colorado from about 25 years ago where a kid had had a little bit too much to drink, was hurtling down a mountain going on moguls. It was a bumpy slope. He had his arms out. He was sitting back on his skis to maximize his speed. And unfortunately, he got some air and hit somebody in the head with the tip of his ski. And the blunt force trauma caused a death. And ultimately, the Colorado Supreme Court said it was appropriate to charge him, to have the jury consider whether that was reckless manslaughter. Did he consciously disregard the substantial risk of death when he engaged in that type of reckless behavior? So it happens. It's relatively rare, but there are criminal actions that derive from ski accidents occasionally.", "content_id": "ac774972f3c4092b4a88f7cfdcbd93cc", "hl1": "Can people injured while skiing sue the ski resorts?", "hl2": "The deck can be stacked in favor of the resorts, GBH's legal analyst said.", "meta": {"copyright": "", "issue_number": "", "volume": ""}, "topic": "Local", "pub_date": "Tue, 28 Mar 2023 10:32:09 EST", "pub_name": "GBH", "link": "https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/28/can-people-injured-while-skiing-sue-the-ski-resorts", "census_tracts": []}, "9341b878a628205a79632d401c12acee": {"author": "", "body": "It\u2019s been nearly three years since Norwood Hospital was forced to close because of severe flooding \u2014 and while ground was broken for a new hospital in November 2021, town officials say it\u2019s not expected to open until 2025. That day can\u2019t come soon enough for leaders in Norwood. Interim Fire Chief Jim Wright says Norwood continues to feel the pain of not having the hospital in town. \u201cIt is a challenge. Our transport times are significantly longer,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would like it if our citizens could get to the hospital in two minutes rather than 15 or 20 minutes, but there is nothing we can do until the hospital is built.\u201dNorwood has two ambulances in service that transport patients to Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital-Needham, hospitals in Boston and Good Samaritan Medical Center in Brockton. But the strain got worse after a major fire shut down Brockton Hospital last month. Wright says Good Samaritan Medical Center is no longer an easy option because patients that would have gone to Brockton are now being rerouted there. Often, residents rely on other towns to get them to hospitals in mutual-aid ambulances supplied by surrounding towns, which answer the call when Norwood doesn\u2019t have an ambulance free. Norwood\u2019s ambulances are now often stuck out of town after delivering patients to a farther-away hospital. \u201cLuckily, we have firefighters that respond and do initial care, but many times we have to wait for a mutual-aid ambulance to come in,\u201d Wright said. Norwood Town Administrator Tony Mazzucco says he doesn\u2019t think anyone ever envisioned that two hospitals in Massachusetts would be closed at the same time. Heavy rain and flash flooding took out Norwood Hospital in June 2020, permanently shutting down the 215-bed facility. Then, in early February of this year, the 10-alarm fire at Brockton Hospital forced roughly 160 patients to evacuate. Brockton Hospital\u2019s operator estimates the site will reopen in late spring. Mazzucco is closely following the rebuilding of Norwood Hospital. He says the former building has been fully demolished, and the foundation for the new hospital is nearly complete. \u201cWhat you\u2019ll likely see in about two or three months is the building\u2019s steel frame going up,\u201d Mazzucco said. \u201cSo, we\u2019re very excited. There have been a lot of these cathartic moments in the process, and the appearance of the steel beams is one of them.\u201d Mazzucco says he knows five years is a long time to wait for a new medical facility but also recognizes the complexities that are involved. Norwood Hospital is the first hospital to be built from the ground up in Massachusetts in more than 25 years, with new technologies \u2014 and new supply chain issues \u2014 emerging in the last few decades.\u201cIt\u2019s rare that a hospital is built in this part of the country, so there\u2019s a little bit of a learning curve for everyone involved,\u201d he said. Mazzucco also gives kudos to the Norwood community at large. \u201cIt\u2019s a big burden on people. You want to go where your doctor is, you want to go where you\u2019re used to.\u201dSteward Health Care, which owns Norwood Hospital, declined to comment at this time. Its website says, when completed, the medical facility will have 130 total acute care beds, emergency services including trauma, pediatric and behavioral health capabilities, advance diagnostic imaging services and outpatient services.The new hospital is also expected to support 4,000 jobs.", "content_id": "9341b878a628205a79632d401c12acee", "hl1": "Norwood Hospital remains closed \u2014 and the Norwood community feels the strain", "hl2": "Brockton Hospital\u2019s 10-alarm fire and temporary closure last month hurt an already-stressed system.", "meta": {"copyright": "", "issue_number": "", "volume": ""}, "topic": "Local", "pub_date": "Mon, 27 Mar 2023 20:19:13 EST", "pub_name": "GBH", "link": "https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/27/norwood-hospital-remains-closed-and-the-norwood-community-feels-the-strain", "census_tracts": []}, "5f3ed869cb0d98d1d6d7f6380b05e3e0": {"author": "", "body": "As Elizabeth Warren launches a bid for a third term in the U.S. Senate, recent polling might seem, at first glance, to suggest that her reelection is far from guaranteed.Earlier this year, a survey by the MassINC Polling Group found Massachusetts residents sharply divided on Warren, with 41% viewing her favorably and 36% unfavorably. A similar split was evident on the question of whether Warren should run again: 43% said she should, while 36% said she shouldn\u2019t.But MassINC pollster Steve Koczela says when it comes to gauging Warren\u2019s current prospects, those results might actually paint an inordinately bleak picture. \u201cShe starts off in a pretty similar place, honestly, to where she was in 2018,\u201d Koczela said, referring to Warren\u2019s last reelection bid. \u201cHer polling, looking back at 2017, wasn\u2019t particularly sparkling, but she went on and cruised to reelection.\u201dIn the 2018 general election, Warren faced former state representative Geoff Diehl \u2014 who had triumphed in a three-way Republican primary \u2014 and beat him handily, 60% to 36%. Koczela\u2019s caveat comes with an asterisk of its own: Diehl, who\u2019d been an early supporter of Donald Trump, personified the Massachusetts Republican Party\u2019s recent turn to the right and preference for ideological purity over electability. A few years after losing to Warren, when then-Republican Gov. Charlie Baker was still weighing whether to seek a third term, Diehl announced a gubernatorial bid of his own, seemingly undeterred by his Senate loss or Baker\u2019s high statewide approval ratings. Baker didn\u2019t run again, and Diehl lost the governor\u2019s race to Maura Healey in a landslide.After a disastrous 2022 election cycle, the Mass. GOP ousted former party chair Jim Lyons and replaced him with Amy Carnevale, who has vowed to rebuild it from the ground up. But Carnevale\u2019s project is just beginning, and the Mass. GOP is still at a nadir in terms of influence and reputation. Against that backdrop, it\u2019s not clear that any electable Republican capable of going toe to toe with Warren \u2014 who made a strong run for the presidency in the 2020 cycle \u2014 will try to unseat her next year. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen quality Republican moderates run and win the governor\u2019s office in Massachusetts,\u201d said UMass Boston political scientist Erin O\u2019Brien. \u201cBut the Massachusetts Republican Party has put out people like Charlie Baker, who was that popular governor, and run people like Geoff Diehl.\u201cIn the abstract, a moderate Republican could do well in Massachusetts,\u201d O\u2019Brien added. \u201cBut it\u2019s only in the abstract, because that individual either doesn\u2019t exist or has been forced out of Massachusetts politics.\u201dIn a text message, Carnevale told GBH News that she expects the party will field a credible challenge to Warren 2024, and that \u201cat least two Republicans\u201d are currently considering a run. She declined to identify them.Warren will also be boosted, in her latest bid, by high popularity among members of her own party \u2014 which make up roughly a third of the state\u2019s voters. In MassINC\u2019s poll, which was conducted in late January and early February, 68% of Democrats viewed her favorably and 69% thought she should run again. In March, another poll, conducted by Change Research for Northwind Strategies, found that while almost as many people viewed Warren unfavorably as favorably, 30% viewed her very favorably \u2014 more than any other Massachusetts politician polled, including Baker.Those numbers suggest two things. First, in a hypothetical 2024 general election matchup, Warren would benefit from a loyal core of supporters who would organize for her, give her money and show up at the polls. And second, anyone who might entertain the prospect of a primary challenge against Warren would face a daunting challenge. The timing of Warren\u2019s announcement is also fortuitous. As bad as the crisis of confidence currently roiling the U.S. banking system is, it\u2019s likely to be a political asset for Warren as she begins campaigning again in earnest. \u201cThat\u2019s ... her bread-and-butter sort of issue,\u201d said Shannon Jenkins, a political scientist at UMass Dartmouth. \u201cThat\u2019s what she knows inside and out. She\u2019s one of the foremost experts on banking policy in the U.S. government right now.\u201dBy renewing her calls for rigorous regulation of the banking industry, Jenkins added, Warren can bolster her standing with the progressive Democrats who make up her political base while appealing to other voters, as well.\u201cNot a lot of people are pro-big banks, right?\u201d said Jenkins. \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of a gut reaction from voters.\u201dDespite all these advantages, though, Warren has some weaknesses that are worth bearing in mind as the 2024 Massachusetts Senate race shapes up.Koczela notes that, when the MassINC poll was conducted earlier this year, Warren\u2019s standing was relatively weak among younger voters, many of whom hadn\u2019t yet formed an opinion of her. Within the state, she\u2019s also more popular with well-educated voters and voters who live close to Boston. In an email, Tatishe Nteta, a political scientist at UMass Amherst and the director of the UMass Poll, noted that surveys he\u2019s worked on show a \u201csteady majority\u201d of Massachusetts residents approve of Warren\u2019s performance, and that she\u2019s been a reliable champion on student-loan forgiveness, income inequality and several other progressive causes highlighted in her campaign kickoff video.But Nteta also said Warren\u2019s performance in the 2020 Massachusetts Democratic presidential primary \u2014 in which she finished third, behind Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders \u2014 suggests she could be vulnerable to a primary challenge from the right.\u201cSome will say that voters in Massachusetts voted strategically for a candidate that could win in a general election matchup with Trump, but some might view these results as evidence of Warren\u2019s weakness among the moderate wing of the Democratic Party and among independents in the state,\u201d Nteta wrote.", "content_id": "5f3ed869cb0d98d1d6d7f6380b05e3e0", "hl1": "Analysis: As Warren seeks a third term, her position is stronger than it seems", "hl2": "An array of factors could help the senior senator from Massachusetts win reelection.", "meta": {"copyright": "", "issue_number": "", "volume": ""}, "topic": "Politics", "pub_date": "Mon, 27 Mar 2023 17:21:01 EST", "pub_name": "GBH", "link": "https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/03/27/analysis-as-warren-seeks-a-third-term-her-position-is-stronger-than-it-seems", "census_tracts": [{"MassINC": {"county_name": "Census Tract 303.02, Suffolk County, Massachusetts", "tract": "030302", "geoid_tract": "25025030302", "neighborhood": "Downtown", "demographics": {"p2_001n": "1844", "p2_002n": "157", "p2_003n": "1687", "p2_004n": "1613", "p2_005n": "1300", "p2_006n": "103", "p2_007n": "2", "p2_008n": "195", "p2_009n": "0", "p2_010n": "13"}}}, {"MassINC Polling Group": {"county_name": "Census Tract 303.02, Suffolk County, Massachusetts", "tract": "030302", "geoid_tract": "25025030302", "neighborhood": "Downtown", "demographics": {"p2_001n": "1844", "p2_002n": "157", "p2_003n": "1687", "p2_004n": "1613", "p2_005n": "1300", "p2_006n": "103", "p2_007n": "2", "p2_008n": "195", "p2_009n": "0", "p2_010n": "13"}}}]}, "1cbaff6c07709c8b0b74325146343b25": {"author": "", "body": "State Auditor Diana DiZoglio dismissed top lawmakers\u2019 claims that she lacks the authority to audit the Legislature on Monday, days after House Speaker Ron Mariano said he wouldn\u2019t comply with her probe. \u201cWe\u2019ve already started the process of conducting the audit,\u201d DiZoglio said in an interview on Boston Public Radio. \u201cWith all due respect to Speaker Mariano, he is one of 200 legislators. Other legislators are more than welcome to speak to our office. Now, they might want to not do that so publicly due to the potential fear of retaliation, but they are able to speak with us. Their staff is as well.\u201dDiZoglio, a Methuen Democrat who has served in both the state House and Senate, was elected auditor last fall after a campaign in which she pledged to audit both the Legislature and the MBTA. She announced March 7 that she\u2019d launched her review of the Legislature, a body that she called \u201ca closed-door operation.\u201d She said she wanted to identify ways state government can do better.DiZoglio\u2019s predecessor, former Auditor Suzanne Bump, said last year that she didn\u2019t believe the office had the authority to audit the Legislature. Mariano and Senate President Karen Spilka appear to share that interpretation of state law.Mariano, in a letter to DiZoglio Friday, and Spilka, in a statement earlier this month, said the House and Senate have rules that require regular audits from outside firms and publicly post their financial information. They both pointed to the Massachusetts Constitution\u2019s separation of powers among the different branches of government. \u201cThat your office has the legal authority to conduct an audit of the General Court is a claim entirely without legal support or precedent, as it runs contrary to multiple, explicit provisions of the Massachusetts Constitution, and is wholly unnecessary as the public currently has full and ready access to the House\u2019s financial information,\u201d Mariano wrote.But in Monday\u2019s interview, DiZoglio made it clear she disagreed. She said that the separation of powers argument is \u201cbogus\u201d because her office audits the courts, mentioning an audit of the Supreme Judicial Court she plans to release soon. \u201cThe Legislature is unfortunately \u2014 not the entire Legislature \u2014 legislative leadership is unfortunately, yes, using that as, frankly, an excuse to not be audited,\u201d she said. \u201cI find it very disappointing.\u201dThe audit standoff comes as the House and the Senate are gearing up to write and debate their versions of next year\u2019s budget, deciding how much money to dedicate to each corner of state government \u2014 including the auditor\u2019s office. Mariano, in an interview on WCVB that aired Sunday, pointed to that dynamic as one reason he doesn\u2019t believe the audit is appropriate. \u201cI have authority over the auditor\u2019s budget, so there are inherent conflicts when you start crossing the executive branch with the legislative branch or the judicial branch, and the constitution is designed to not allow those interferences,\u201d he said. Gov. Maura Healey\u2019s budget proposal recommends funding the auditor\u2019s office and its various divisions at a total of $26.6 million for the next fiscal year, nearly $4 million more than what was in this year\u2019s budget. DiZoglio said if the Legislature decides not to \u201cadequately\u201d fund her office in retaliation for her audit, \u201cthey would be retaliating against the residents of Massachusetts who deserve to know how their taxpayer dollars are being spent.\u201d DiZoglio said she hopes her review of the Legislature will increase transparency and accountability on Beacon Hill. Massachusetts is unique among state governments because its courts, governor\u2019s office and Legislature all claim exemption from public records laws. The state\u2019s open meeting law, too, excludes the Legislature.\u201cRight now, bills are being voted on in the dark of night, committee votes are not being made public, even legislators sometimes don't have the opportunity to read bills upwards of 100 pages or more until just before the vote is being taken,\u201d DiZoglio said.", "content_id": "1cbaff6c07709c8b0b74325146343b25", "hl1": "DiZoglio says top lawmakers\u2019 arguments are an \u2018excuse\u2019 not to be audited", "hl2": "The clash comes as the Legislature embarks on budgeting \u2014 including funding for DiZoglio\u2019s office.", "meta": {"copyright": "", "issue_number": "", "volume": ""}, "topic": "Politics", "pub_date": "Mon, 27 Mar 2023 14:32:33 EST", "pub_name": "GBH", "link": "https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/03/27/dizoglio-says-top-lawmakers-arguments-are-an-excuse-not-to-be-audited", "census_tracts": [{"Boston Public Radio": {"county_name": "Census Tract 303.02, Suffolk County, Massachusetts", "tract": "030302", "geoid_tract": "25025030302", "neighborhood": "Downtown", "demographics": {"p2_001n": "1844", "p2_002n": "157", "p2_003n": "1687", "p2_004n": "1613", "p2_005n": "1300", "p2_006n": "103", "p2_007n": "2", "p2_008n": "195", "p2_009n": "0", "p2_010n": "13"}}}]}, "3a32dc2369fdb00678a2a03e20a122a7": {"author": "", "body": "BOSTON (AP) \u2014 Phillip Eng, an engineer with decades of experience running public transit systems, has been named the general manager of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, the Boston area\u2019s troubled public transit agency, Gov.

Nine people were injured in September 2021 when an escalator at a station malfunctioned, and more than two dozen people went to the hospital in July 2021 when a Green Line train rear-ended another trolley.Last July, a subway train caught fire as it was crossing a bridge north of Boston, prompting one passenger to jump into the Mystic River and others to scramble out of windows.\u201cIt\u2019s time for a new way of doing business at the MBTA,\" Eng said in a statement. \u201cAs an engineer, a transportation professional for 40 years, and a commuter myself, I\u2019m laser focused on finding innovative solutions to complex problems and approaching them with a sense of urgency that always puts the customer first.\u201dAs interim president of NYC Transit, he was integral in initiating and implementing the $836 million plan to fix aging infrastructure and improve performance.

Elizabeth Warren announced Monday that she will seek a third term in 2024.Warren, a prominent voice for the liberal wing of the Democratic Party and a failed 2020 presidential contender, said she's running for reelection to end corruption in Washington, make the economy work for the middle class and protect democracy.\"I first ran for Senate because I saw how the system is rigged for the rich and powerful and against everyone else. I won because Massachusetts voters know it, too. And now I'm running for Senate again because there's a lot more we've got to do,\" Warren said in a campaign video released Monday.Warren, 73, had more than $2.3 million in her campaign account at the end of 2022, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission.Warren first won election to the seat in 2012, defeating incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Scott Brown, who was elected to fill out the term of Democratic U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, who died in 2009.With the win, the then-Harvard Law School professor became the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts.In 2018, Warren won a second term, easily defeating Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, before quickly setting her sights on the presidency.While popular among some Democratic voters for her blunt rhetoric, Warren was unable to break away from the party's pack of contenders and dropped out after failing to win any of the states that voted on Super Tuesday, including coming in third in the Democratic primary in her home state.During the campaign against Brown and again during her bid for the presidency, Warren was dogged by past claims of Native American heritage and her inability to provide documentation of that ancestry.That led then-President Donald Trump to go after her early in the presidential campaign, derisively labeling her \"Pocahontas.\" Warren had said she learned of her family ties to Cherokee and Delaware tribes from stories told by her parents.After the 2020 loss, Warren continued her focus on the financial sector.Warren recently joined California Rep. Katie Porter, a Democrat, to push a proposal to repeal a 2018 rollback of certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act, enacted after the financial crisis a decade earlier.The bill, part of discussions in Congress following the recent abrupt failure of two banks, is unlikely to advance.In her campaign video, Warren ticked off a series of priorities from passing a wealth tax and putting stricter rules on banks to making child care more affordable, protecting coastal communities and building what she called \"a 21st century transportation system across all of Massachusetts.\"It's unclear who might challenge Warren for the Senate seat. Many Democrats appeared to be waiting until Warren or fellow Massachusetts U.S. Sen. Edward Markey, also a Democrat, decided not to seek reelection. Markey in 2020 fended off a primary challenge from then-Democratic U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy.The state's Republican Party is trying to rebuild after losing the governor's office last year when Republican Gov. Charlie Baker opted not to seek a third term and Democrat Maura Healey handily defeated GOP candidate Geoff Diehl.Warren already has the backing of many high-profile Massachusetts Democrats including U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu and Markey.Warren serves on several congressional committees including the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Armed Services.", "content_id": "590eee051c20b1ab1b243521b8cb3555", "hl1": "Elizabeth Warren running for third Senate term", "hl2": "Warren, a prominent voice for the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, will run again in 2024.", "meta": {"copyright": "", "issue_number": "", "volume": ""}, "topic": "Politics", "pub_date": "Mon, 27 Mar 2023 07:43:49 EST", "pub_name": "GBH", "link": "https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/03/27/elizabeth-warren-running-for-third-senate-term", "census_tracts": []}}
